Wi-Fi sensing leverages conventional Wi-Fi transmissions to extract\nand analyze channel state information (CSI) for applications like proximity\ndetection, occupancy detection, activity recognition, and health monitoring. By\nleveraging existing infrastructure, Wi-Fi sensing offers a privacy-preserving,\nnon-intrusive, and cost-effective solution which, unlike cameras, is not\nsensitive to lighting conditions. Beginning with a comprehensive review of the\nWi-Fi standardization activities, this tutorial-cum-survey first introduces\nfundamental concepts related to Wi-Fi CSI, outlines the CSI measurement\nmethods, and examines the impact of mobile objects on CSI. The mechanics of a\nsimplified testbed for CSI extraction are also described. Then, we present a\nqualitative comparison of the existing Wi-Fi sensing datasets, their\nspecifications, and pin-point their shortcomings. Next, a variety of\npreprocessing techniques are discussed that are beneficial for feature\nextraction and explainability of machine learning (ML) algorithms. We then\nprovide a qualitative review of recent ML approaches in the domain of Wi-Fi\nsensing and present the significance of self-supervised learning (SSL) in that\ncontext. Specifically, the mechanics of contrastive and non-contrastive\nlearning solutions is elaborated in detail and a quantitative comparative\nanalysis is presented in terms of classification accuracy.

Compared with unimodality, a more\nrobust utterance representation can be obtained by fusing complementary\nsemantic information from different modalities. However, the modality missing\nproblem severely limits the performance of MERC in practical scenarios. Recent\nwork has achieved impressive performance on modality completion using graph\nneural networks and diffusion models, respectively. This inspires us to combine\nthese two dimensions through the graph diffusion model to obtain more powerful\nmodal recovery capabilities. Unfortunately, existing graph diffusion models may\ndestroy the connectivity and local structure of the graph by directly adding\nGaussian noise to the adjacency matrix, resulting in the generated graph data\nbeing unable to retain the semantic and topological information of the original\ngraph. To this end, we propose a novel Graph Spectral Diffusion Network\n(GSDNet), which maps Gaussian noise to the graph spectral space of missing\nmodalities and recovers the missing data according to its original\ndistribution. Compared with previous graph diffusion methods, GSDNet only\naffects the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix instead of destroying the\nadjacency matrix directly, which can maintain the global topological\ninformation and important spectral features during the diffusion process.\nExtensive experiments have demonstrated that GSDNet achieves state-of-the-art\nemotion recognition performance in various modality loss scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u56fe\u8c31\u6269\u6563\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GSDNet\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u56fe\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff08MERC\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u56fe\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGSDNet\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u56fe\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGSDNet\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GSDNet\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u8c31\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In response, the community has introduced\ndedicated benchmarks and tailored detection strategies. As the field advances,\nefforts have moved beyond binary detection toward source attribution, including\nopen-set attribution, which aims to identify the NAC responsible for generation\nand flag novel, unseen ones during inference. This shift toward source\nattribution improves forensic interpretability and accountability. However,\nopen-set attribution remains fundamentally limited: while it can detect that a\nNAC is unfamiliar, it cannot characterize or identify individual unseen codecs.\nIt treats such inputs as generic ``unknowns'', lacking insight into their\ninternal configuration. This leads to major shortcomings: limited\ngeneralization to new NACs and inability to resolve fine-grained variations\nwithin NAC families. To address these gaps, we propose Neural Audio Codec\nSource Parsing (NACSP) - a paradigm shift that reframes source attribution for\nCFs as structured regression over generative NAC parameters such as quantizers,\nbandwidth, and sampling rate. We formulate NACSP as a multi-task regression\ntask for predicting these NAC parameters and establish the first comprehensive\nbenchmark using various state-of-the-art speech pre-trained models (PTMs). To\nthis end, we propose HYDRA, a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic\ngeometry to disentangle complex latent properties from PTM representations. By\nemploying task-specific attention over multiple curvature-aware hyperbolic\nsubspaces, HYDRA enables superior multi-task generalization.

D. Dissertation in English(KAIST)", "summary": "Recent research in deep learning-based Sound Event Detection (SED) has\nprimarily focused on Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) and\nTransformer models. However, conventional 2D convolution-based models assume\nshift invariance along both the temporal and frequency axes, leadin to\ninconsistencies when dealing with frequency-dependent characteristics of\nacoustic signals. To address this issue, this study proposes Frequency Dynamic\nConvolution (FDY conv), which dynamically adjusts convolutional kernels based\non the frequency composition of the input signal to enhance SED performance.\nFDY conv constructs an optimal frequency response by adaptively weighting\nmultiple basis kernels based on frequency-specific attention weights.\nExperimental results show that applying FDY conv to CRNNs improves performance\non the DESED dataset by 7.56% compared to the baseline CRNN. However, FDY conv\nhas limitations in that it combines basis kernels of the same shape across all\nfrequencies, restricting its ability to capture diverse frequency-specific\ncharacteristics. Additionally, the $3\\times3$ basis kernel size is insufficient\nto capture a broader frequency range. To overcome these limitations, this study\nintroduces an extended family of FDY conv models. Dilated FDY conv (DFD conv)\napplies convolutional kernels with various dilation rates to expand the\nreceptive field along the frequency axis and enhance frequency-specific feature\nrepresentation. Experimental results show that DFD conv improves performance by\n9.27% over the baseline. Partial FDY conv (PFD conv) addresses the high\ncomputational cost of FDY conv, which results from performing all convolution\noperations with dynamic kernels. Since FDY conv may introduce unnecessary\nadaptivity for quasi-stationary sound events, PFD conv integrates standard 2D\nconvolutions with frequency-adaptive kernels to reduce computational complexity\nwhile maintaining performance. Experimental results demonstrate that PFD conv\nimproves performance by 7.80% over the baseline while reducing the number of\nparameters by 54.4% compared to FDY conv. Multi-Dilated FDY conv (MDFD conv)\nextends DFD conv by addressing its structural limitation of applying the same\ndilation across all frequencies. By utilizing multiple convolutional kernels\nwith different dilation rates, MDFD conv effectively captures diverse\nfrequency-dependent patterns. Experimental results indicate that MDFD conv\nachieves the highest performance, improving the baseline CRNN performance by\n10.98%. Furthermore, standard FDY conv employs Temporal Average Pooling, which\nassigns equal weight to all frames along the time axis, limiting its ability to\neffectively capture transient events. To overcome this, this study proposes\nTAP-FDY conv (TFD conv), which integrates Temporal Attention Pooling (TA) that\nfocuses on salient features, Velocity Attention Pooling (VA) that emphasizes\ntransient characteristics, and Average Pooling (AP) that captures stationary\nproperties. TAP-FDY conv achieves the same performance as MDFD conv but reduces\nthe number of parameters by approximately 30.01% (12.703M vs. 18.157M),\nachieving equivalent accuracy with lower computational complexity. Class-wise\nperformance analysis reveals that FDY conv improves detection of non-stationary\nevents, DFD conv is particularly effective for events with broad spectral\nfeatures, and PFD conv enhances the detection of quasi-stationary events.\nAdditionally, TFD conv (TFD-CRNN) demonstrates strong performance in detecting\ntransient events. In the case studies, PFD conv effectively captures stable\nsignal patterns in tank powertrain fault recognition, DFD conv recognizes wide\nharmonic spectral patterns on speed-varying motor fault recognition, while TFD\nconv outperforms other models in detecting transient signals in offshore arc\ndetection. These results suggest that frequency-adaptive convolutions and their\nextended variants provide a robust alternative to conventional 2D convolutions\nin deep learning-based audio processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u5377\u79ef\uff08FDY conv\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff08DFD conv\u3001PFD conv\u3001MDFD conv\u3001TFD conv\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf2D\u5377\u79ef\u5728\u58f0\u97f3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08SED\uff09\u4e2d\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf2D\u5377\u79ef\u5047\u8bbe\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u8f74\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u58f0\u97f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFDY conv\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5377\u79ef\u6838\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u62ecDFD conv\uff08\u6269\u5f20\u5377\u79ef\uff09\u3001PFD conv\uff08\u90e8\u5206\u52a8\u6001\u5377\u79ef\uff09\u3001MDFD conv\uff08\u591a\u6269\u5f20\u5377\u79ef\uff09\u548cTFD conv\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\uff09\u3002", "result": "FDY conv\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd7.56%\uff0cDFD conv\u63d0\u53479.27%\uff0cPFD conv\u63d0\u53477.80%\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u657054.4%\uff0cMDFD conv\u63d0\u534710.98%\uff0cTFD conv\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eMDFD conv\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1130.01%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9891\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5377\u79ef\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

However, intermittent and\nunpredictable terrestrial interference significantly affects system reliability\nand performance. Continuously employing sophisticated interference mitigation\ntechniques is practically inefficient. Motivated by the periodic idle intervals\ncharacteristic of burst-mode satellite transmissions, this paper investigates\nonline interference detection frameworks specifically tailored for\nsatellite-to-device scenarios. We first rigorously formulate interference\ndetection as a binary hypothesis testing problem, leveraging differences\nbetween Rayleigh (no interference) and Rice (interference present)\ndistributions.

The main difficulties and challenges lie in achieving a balance\nbetween complexity and performance according to the characteristics of the\ntask. In this paper, we propose an intra-inter set knowledge distillation (KD)\nframework with time-frequency calibration (I$^2$S-TFCKD) for SE. Different from\nprevious distillation strategies for SE, the proposed framework fully utilizes\nthe time-frequency differential information of speech while promoting global\nknowledge flow. Firstly, we propose a multi-layer interactive distillation\nbased on dual-stream time-frequency cross-calibration, which calculates the\nteacher-student similarity calibration weights in the time and frequency\ndomains respectively and performs cross-weighting, thus enabling refined\nallocation of distillation contributions across different layers according to\nspeech characteristics. Secondly, we construct a collaborative distillation\nparadigm for intra-set and inter-set correlations. Within a correlated set,\nmulti-layer teacher-student features are pairwise matched for calibrated\ndistillation. Subsequently, we generate representative features from each\ncorrelated set through residual fusion to form the fused feature set that\nenables inter-set knowledge interaction. The proposed distillation strategy is\napplied to the dual-path dilated convolutional recurrent network (DPDCRN) that\nranked first in the SE track of the L3DAS23 challenge.

As efficient resource\nallocation is essential for achieving high-quality communication in OFDMA-based\nCR networks, these challenges degrade communication reliability in UWA systems.\nTo resolve the issue, we propose an end-to-end sensing and resource\noptimization method using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in an OFDMA-based\nUWA-CR network.

However, the subjective moments of negative experience, where the conversation loses fluidity or enjoyment remain understudied. These moments are infrequent in naturalistic data, and thus training a supervised learning (SL) model requires costly manual data annotation. We applied semi-supervised learning (SSL) to leverage targeted labeled and unlabeled clips for training multimodal (audio, facial, text) deep features to predict non-fluid or unenjoyable moments in holdout videoconference sessions. The modality-fused co-training SSL achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.9 and an F1 score of 0.6, outperforming SL models by up to 4% with the same amount of labeled data. Remarkably, the best SSL model with just 8% labeled data matched 96% of the SL model's full-data performance.

However, its substantial computational and energy requirements pose significant challenges. We introduce ASAP-FE (Agile Sparsity-Aware Parallelized-Feature Extractor), a hardware-oriented front-end designed to address these challenges. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Half-overlapped Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Framing: This reduces redundant data by approximately 25% while maintaining essential phoneme transition cues. (2) Sparsity-aware Data Reduction: We exploit frame-level sparsity to achieve an additional 50% data reduction by combining frame skipping with stride-based filtering. (3) Dynamic Parallel Processing: We introduce a parameterizable filter cluster and a priority-based scheduling algorithm that allows parallel execution of IIR filtering tasks, reducing latency and optimizing energy efficiency. ASAP-FE is implemented with various filter cluster sizes on edge processors, with functionality verified on FPGA prototypes and designs synthesized at 45 nm. Experimental results using TC-ResNet8, DS-CNN, and KWT-1 demonstrate that ASAP-FE reduces the average workload by 62.73% while supporting real-time processing for up to 32 channels. Compared to a conventional fully overlapped baseline, ASAP-FE achieves less than a 1% accuracy drop (e.g., 96.22% vs. 97.13% for DS-CNN), which is well within acceptable limits for edge AI. By adjusting the number of filter modules, our design optimizes the trade-off between performance and energy, with 15 parallel filters providing optimal performance for up to 25 channels.

At high speeds and in cluttered environments, Doppler shifts and rapid multipath changes can dramatically raise packet error rates. This paper investigates these phenomena in the context of ExpressLRS (ELRS) long-range FPV control links and demonstrates a novel solution: real-time geometry tuning of a circularly polarized helical antenna array. This study integrates Maxwell-equation-based full-wave simulations (via Ansys HFSS) with controlled, blind field trials to validate performance. A new analysis framework incorporates Doppler-induced frequency offset into the antenna's radiation pattern and the system's error model. Compared to a conventional fixed antenna, the adaptive helical array shows a 20-30% PER reduction when drones exceed 150 mph. The adaptive system automatically adjusts coil pitch and diameter to retune the antenna as flight parameters (velocity, attitude) change. Measured VSWR stays near unity, preventing transmitter reflection spikes. RSSI variation is reduced by half, indicating stronger link stability in urban multi-path.

The sounds of our lungs, heart, and voice convey vital information about our health. Yet, in contemporary medicine, these sounds are primarily analyzed through auditory interpretation by experts using devices like stethoscopes. Automated analysis offers the potential to standardize the processing of medical sounds, enable screening in low-resource settings where physicians are scarce, and detect subtle patterns that may elude human perception, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and treatment.\n  Focusing on the analysis of infant cry sounds to predict medical conditions, this thesis contributes on four key fronts. First, in low-data settings, we demonstrate that large databases of adult speech can be harnessed through neural transfer learning to develop more accurate and robust models for infant cry analysis. Second, in cost-effective modeling, we introduce an end-to-end model compression approach for recurrent networks using tensor decomposition. Our method requires no post-hoc processing, achieves compression rates of several hundred-fold, and delivers accurate, portable models suitable for resource-constrained devices. Third, we propose novel domain adaptation techniques tailored for audio models and adapt existing methods from computer vision. These approaches address dataset bias and enhance generalization across domains while maintaining strong performance on the original data. Finally, to advance research in this domain, we release a unique, open-source dataset of infant cry sounds, developed in collaboration with clinicians worldwide.\n  This work lays the foundation for recognizing the infant cry as a vital sign and highlights the transformative potential of AI-driven audio monitoring in shaping the future of accessible and affordable healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5a74\u513f\u54ed\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u533b\u7597\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u80ba\u97f3\u3001\u5fc3\u97f3\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\uff09\u8574\u542b\u91cd\u8981\u5065\u5eb7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u542c\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3001\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u96be\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528\u6210\u4eba\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u5a74\u513f\u54ed\u58f0\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1\u97f3\u9891\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b4. \u53d1\u5e03\u5f00\u6e90\u5a74\u513f\u54ed\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff08\u6570\u767e\u500d\uff09\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5a74\u513f\u54ed\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5c06\u5a74\u513f\u54ed\u58f0\u89c6\u4e3a\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u97f3\u9891\u76d1\u6d4b\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u666e\u60e0\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, in practice, as the number of antennas at the access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this challenge, this paper considers a hybrid near-far field activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO, and establishes a covariance-based formulation, which facilitates the development of a distributed algorithm to alleviate the computational burden at the central processing unit (CPU). Specifically, each AP performs local activity detection for the devices and then transmits the detection result to the CPU for further processing.

This contribution introduces the Fretting-Transformer, an encoderdecoder model that utilizes a T5 transformer architecture to automate the transcription of MIDI sequences into guitar tablature. By framing the task as a symbolic translation problem, the model addresses key challenges, including string-fret ambiguity and physical playability. The proposed system leverages diverse datasets, including DadaGP, GuitarToday, and Leduc, with novel data pre-processing and tokenization strategies.

However, the dynamic nature of satellite channels and their inherent impairments present significant challenges. In this paper, a novel post-compensation scheme that combines the complex-valued extreme learning machine with augmented hidden layer (CELMAH) architecture and widely linear processing (WLP) is developed to address these issues by exploiting signal impropriety in satellite communications. Although CELMAH shares structural similarities with WLP, it employs a different core algorithm and does not fully exploit the signal impropriety. By incorporating WLP principles, we derive a tailored formulation suited to the network structure and propose the CELM augmented by widely linear least squares (CELM-WLLS) for post-distortion. The proposed approach offers enhanced communication robustness and is highly effective for satellite communication scenarios characterized by dynamic channel conditions and non-linear impairments. CELM-WLLS is designed to improve signal recovery performance and outperform traditional methods such as least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). Compared to CELMAH, CELM-WLLS demonstrates approximately 0.8 dB gain in BER performance, and also achieves a two-thirds reduction in computational complexity, making it a more efficient solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408CELMAH\u67b6\u6784\u548cWLP\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u540e\u8865\u507f\u65b9\u6848CELM-WLLS\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u9053\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u635f\u4f24\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u56fa\u6709\u635f\u4f24\u5bf95G\u540e\u7f51\u7edc\u53d1\u5c55\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408CELMAH\u548cWLP\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCELM-WLLS\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u975e\u7eaf\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u5931\u771f\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "CELM-WLLS\u5728BER\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6bd4CELMAH\u63d0\u5347\u7ea60.8 dB\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e8c\u3002", "conclusion": "CELM-WLLS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We present a unified framework that trains a single end-to-end ASR model for both streaming and non-streaming applications, leveraging future context information. We propose to use dynamic right-context through the chunked attention masking in the training of zipformer-based ASR models. We demonstrate that using right-context is more effective in zipformer models compared to other conformer models due to its multi-scale nature. We analyze the effect of varying the number of right-context frames on accuracy and latency of the streaming ASR models. We use Librispeech and large in-house conversational datasets to train different versions of streaming and non-streaming models and evaluate them in a production grade server-client setup across diverse testsets of different domains. The proposed strategy reduces word error by relative 7.9\\% with a small degradation in user-perceived latency. By adding more right-context frames, we are able to achieve streaming performance close to that of non-streaming models.

Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes.

Drawing on phenomenological and inductive methods, it argues that pitch is not an ontologically objective property but a perceptual construct shaped by listeners and conditions. Analyses of quasi-harmonic tones reveal that a single tone can convey multiple pitches, giving rise to tonal fission. The perception of pitch may also be multistable, varying for the same listener over time. In this framework, the tuning system may emerge from a tone's internal structure. A parallel with the coastline paradox supports a model of pitch grounded in perceptual variability, challenging inherited theoretical norms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f53\u4ee3\u6d41\u884c\u97f3\u4e50\uff08CPM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u97f3\u9ad8\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u97f3\u4e50\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u97f3\u9ad8\u5e76\u975e\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7531\u542c\u4f17\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5851\u9020\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6784\u9020\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u97f3\u9ad8\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u97f3\u4e50\u7b49\u73b0\u4ee3\u97f3\u4e50\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u97f3\u9ad8\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u51c6\u8c10\u6ce2\u97f3\u8c03\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u97f3\u9ad8\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u4e2a\u97f3\u8c03\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f20\u8fbe\u591a\u4e2a\u97f3\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u97f3\u8c03\u5206\u88c2\uff1b\u97f3\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u542c\u4f17\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u97f3\u8c03\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u51b3\u5b9a\u8c03\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u97f3\u9ad8\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u89c4\u8303\u3002"}}

While a related task, audio fingerprinting, has made significant progress in accurately retrieving musical content under \"real world\" (noisy, reverberant) conditions, ASID systems struggle to identify samples that have undergone musical modifications. Thus, a system robust to common music production transformations such as time-stretching, pitch-shifting, effects processing, and underlying or overlaying music is an important open challenge.\n  In this work, we propose a lightweight and scalable encoding architecture employing a Graph Neural Network within a contrastive learning framework.

Current generative models of music produce expressive output but are not able to generate in an \\emph{online} manner, meaning simultaneously with other musicians (human or otherwise). We propose ReaLchords, an online generative model for improvising chord accompaniment to user melody. We start with an online model pretrained by maximum likelihood, and use reinforcement learning to finetune the model for online use. The finetuning objective leverages both a novel reward model that provides feedback on both harmonic and temporal coherency between melody and chord, and a divergence term that implements a novel type of distillation from a teacher model that can see the future melody. Through quantitative experiments and listening tests, we demonstrate that the resulting model adapts well to unfamiliar input and produce fitting accompaniment.

This paper investigates the influence of signal quantization on\nperformance of first-order 1D DMAs across various beampatterns. An analytical\nexpression for quantized beamformed output for a first-order 1D DMA has been\nformulated. The effect of signal quantization has been studied on array\nperformance measures such as the Beampattern, Directivity Factor (DF),\nFront-to-Back Ratio (FBR), and null depth (ND). Simulation results reveal that\nbeampattern shape remains structurally invariant across quantization bit\ndepths, with quantization primarily affecting ND. DF and FBR remain constant\nwith the varying number of quantization bits. Additionally, ND is shown to be\nfrequency-independent; however, it increases with increasing quantization bit\ndepths, enhancing interference suppression. The study also examines the effect\nof steering nulls across the azimuthal range, showing that ND degrades as the\nnull moves closer to the source look direction, indicating reduced interference\nsuppression."}

Eltawil"], "title": "Analyzing URA Geometry for Enhanced Spatial Multiplexing and Extended Near-Field Coverage", "comment": null, "summary": "With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high frequency bands, future\nwireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative\nnear-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused\nwithin a spatial region of finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in both\nthe angular and range dimensions. This paper derives the beamdepth for a\ngeneralized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry\ninfluences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field\nbeamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of\nbeamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective\nbeamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis\nreveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is\nmaximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a\nsquare URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely\nconstrained EBRD. Simulation results confirm that a wide or tall URA achieves a\nsum rate of 3.5 X more than that of a square URA, benefiting from the extended\nEBRD and improved spatial multiplexing capabilities."}

The\nnear-field propagation achieved by gMIMO introduces unique opportunities for\nenergy-efficient, high-capacity communication systems that cater to the demands\nof 6G wireless networks. Exploiting spherical wave propagation, near-field\nSWIPT with gMIMO enables precise energy and data delivery, enhancing spectral\nefficiency through beamfocusing and massive spatial multiplexing. This paper\ndiscusses theoretical principles, design challenges, and enabling solutions,\nincluding advanced channel estimation techniques, precoding strategies, and\ndynamic array configurations such as sparse and modular arrays. Through\nanalytical insights and a case study, this paper demonstrates the feasibility\nof achieving optimized energy harvesting and data throughput in dense and\ndynamic environments.

However, controlling the generation\nprocess to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.\nEven a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can\ndrastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the\napplication of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.\nSpecifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained\ntext-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the\nunderlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the\noverall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,\nand finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen\nintermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a\nbalance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the\ndesired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the\ntext-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's\nspeed."}

Main category: eess.SP

Motivation: 量化是数据采集中的关键环节，但其对一维一阶差分麦克风阵列性能的影响尚未被研究。

Method: 通过分析量化波束成形输出的表达式，研究了量化对波束图、DF、FBR和ND的影响。

Result: 量化不影响波束形状、DF和FBR，但ND随量化位深增加而改善，且与频率无关。零深在靠近声源方向时性能下降。

Conclusion: 量化主要影响ND，对DMA的其他性能指标影响较小，研究结果为实际系统设计提供了参考。

Abstract: In practical systems, recorded analog signals must be digitized for
processing, introducing quantization as a critical aspect of data acquisition.
While prior studies have examined quantization effects in various signal
processing contexts, its impact on differential microphone arrays (DMAs),
particularly in one-dimensional (1D) first-order configurations, remains
unexplored. This paper investigates the influence of signal quantization on
performance of first-order 1D DMAs across various beampatterns. An analytical
expression for quantized beamformed output for a first-order 1D DMA has been
formulated. The effect of signal quantization has been studied on array
performance measures such as the Beampattern, Directivity Factor (DF),
Front-to-Back Ratio (FBR), and null depth (ND). Simulation results reveal that
beampattern shape remains structurally invariant across quantization bit
depths, with quantization primarily affecting ND. DF and FBR remain constant
with the varying number of quantization bits. Additionally, ND is shown to be
frequency-independent; however, it increases with increasing quantization bit
depths, enhancing interference suppression. The study also examines the effect
of steering nulls across the azimuthal range, showing that ND degrades as the
null moves closer to the source look direction, indicating reduced interference
suppression.

*Ahmed Hussain,Asmaa Abdallah,Abdulkadir Celik,Ahmed M. Eltawil*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了近场波束聚焦在大型天线阵列中的应用，分析了不同阵列几何形状对波束深度和空间复用能力的影响。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高频段大型天线阵列的部署，未来无线通信系统可能工作在辐射近场区域，需要研究近场波束聚焦的潜力及其限制。

Method: 推导了广义均匀矩形阵列（URA）的波束深度，定义了有效波束聚焦瑞利距离（EBRD），并通过仿真验证了不同几何形状URA的性能。

Result: 方形URA波束深度最窄，但EBRD受限；宽或高URA的EBRD更大，空间复用能力更强，多用户和速率是方形URA的3.5倍。

Conclusion: 宽或高URA在近场波束聚焦中表现更优，因其扩展的EBRD和增强的空间复用能力。

Abstract: With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high frequency bands, future
wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative
near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused
within a spatial region of finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in both
the angular and range dimensions. This paper derives the beamdepth for a
generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry
influences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field
beamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of
beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective
beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis
reveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is
maximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a
square URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely
constrained EBRD. Simulation results confirm that a wide or tall URA achieves a
sum rate of 3.5 X more than that of a square URA, benefiting from the extended
EBRD and improved spatial multiplexing capabilities.

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT) with gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (gMIMO)
technology operating in the upper mid-band frequency range (7-24 GHz). The
near-field propagation achieved by gMIMO introduces unique opportunities for
energy-efficient, high-capacity communication systems that cater to the demands
of 6G wireless networks. Exploiting spherical wave propagation, near-field
SWIPT with gMIMO enables precise energy and data delivery, enhancing spectral
efficiency through beamfocusing and massive spatial multiplexing. This paper
discusses theoretical principles, design challenges, and enabling solutions,
including advanced channel estimation techniques, precoding strategies, and
dynamic array configurations such as sparse and modular arrays. Through
analytical insights and a case study, this paper demonstrates the feasibility
of achieving optimized energy harvesting and data throughput in dense and
dynamic environments. These findings contribute to advancing energy-autonomous
Internet-of-Everything (IoE) deployments, smart factory networks, and other
energy-autonomous applications aligned with the goals of next-generation
wireless technologies.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.

These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or\nanalyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic\nindices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,\ne.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,\nanthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is\nrequired to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small\ndatasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce\naudio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review\nimpractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio\n(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic\ndata, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the\nU.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls\n(Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins\n2022; Ruff et al. 2020).

Recent\nadvances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of\nhigh-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance.\nHowever, the effect of source separation has not been systematically\ninvestigated in order to establish best practices for its use.

However, controlling the generation\nprocess to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.\nEven a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can\ndrastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the\napplication of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.\nSpecifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained\ntext-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the\nunderlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the\noverall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,\nand finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen\nintermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a\nbalance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the\ndesired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the\ntext-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's\nspeed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u4e50\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e50\u5668\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u97f3\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e50\u5668\u97f3\u8272\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u4e50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u97f3\u4e50\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u6548\u679c\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u4e50\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e50\u5668\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e50\u5668\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u97f3\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8c03\u6574\u4e86\u4e50\u5668\u97f3\u8272\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e50\u5668\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e3a\u97f3\u4e50\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing\nTM-IRS design methods typically target a single user direction and follow\npredefined rule-based procedures, making them unsuitable for multi-user\nscenarios. Here, we propose a generative AI-based approach to design good sets\nof TM-IRS parameters out of a set of all possible quantized ranges of\nparameters. The design objective is to maximize the sum rate across the\nauthorized directions.

Conventional TTS training pipelines require well-curated corpora with\nhigh acoustic quality and accurate text-speech alignment, which severely limits\nscalability, speaker diversity, and real-world applicability. While recent\nstudies have proposed acoustic-quality-based data selection techniques, they\noften overlook two critical aspects: (1) the inherent robustness of modern TTS\nmodels to noise, and (2) the potential contribution of perceptually low-quality\nyet informative samples. To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a\ndata-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1)\nautomated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic\nselection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3)\nevaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean\nopinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance.\nFurthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a\nclosed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data\ncleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model.

However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense\ncell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing\noverhead and high latency in data exchange. How to leverage OOB modalities to\neliminate pilot overhead and achieve efficient multi-BS coordination in\nmulti-BS systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel\nOOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize\nmulti-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB\nmodalities, i.e., vision and location. Specifically, mobile users are initially\nidentified via spatial alignment of visual sensing and location feedback, and\nthen tracked according to the temporal correlation in image sequence.\nSubsequently, a binary encoding map based gain and beam prediction network\n(BEM-GBPN) is designed to predict beamforming gains and optimal beams for\nmobile users at each BS, such that a central unit can control the BSs to\nperform user handoff and beam switching. Simulation results indicate that the\nproposed OMS-based mobility management scheme enhances beam prediction and BS\nselection accuracy and enables users to achieve 91% transmission rates of the\noptimal with zero pilot overhead and significantly improve multi-BS\ncoordination efficiency compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eOOB\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\uff08OMS\uff09\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53cd\u9988\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7528\u6237\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u57fa\u7ad9\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u7528\u6237\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u73b0\u6709OOB\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e24\u79cdOOB\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1BEM-GBPN\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u6ce2\u675f\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6ce2\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u5207\u6362\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u96f6\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u768491%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9\u534f\u8c03\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "OMS\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address this, South Korea has decided\nto deploy an enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system as a complementary\nPNT solution. Similar to GNSS, eLoran provides highly accurate timing\ninformation, which is essential for applications such as telecommunications,\nfinancial systems, and power distribution. However, the primary sources of\nerror for GNSS and eLoran differ. For eLoran, the main source of error is\nsignal propagation delay over land, known as the additional secondary factor\n(ASF). This delay, influenced by ground conductivity and weather conditions\nalong the signal path, is challenging to predict and mitigate. In this paper,\nwe measure the time difference (TD) between GPS and eLoran using a time\ninterval counter and analyze the correlations between eLoran/GPS TD and eleven\nmeteorological factors. Accurate estimation of eLoran/GPS TD could enable\neLoran to achieve timing accuracy comparable to that of GPS. We propose two\nestimation models for eLoran/GPS TD and compare their performance with existing\nTD estimation methods. The proposed WLR-AGRNN model captures the linear\nrelationships between meteorological factors and eLoran/GPS TD using weighted\nlinear regression (WLR) and models nonlinear relationships between outputs from\nexpert networks through an anisotropic general regression neural network\n(AGRNN).

This paper investigates the influence of signal quantization on\nperformance of first-order 1D DMAs across various beampatterns. An analytical\nexpression for quantized beamformed output for a first-order 1D DMA has been\nformulated. The effect of signal quantization has been studied on array\nperformance measures such as the Beampattern, Directivity Factor (DF),\nFront-to-Back Ratio (FBR), and null depth (ND). Simulation results reveal that\nbeampattern shape remains structurally invariant across quantization bit\ndepths, with quantization primarily affecting ND.

Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused\nwithin a spatial region of finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in both\nthe angular and range dimensions. This paper derives the beamdepth for a\ngeneralized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry\ninfluences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field\nbeamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of\nbeamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective\nbeamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis\nreveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is\nmaximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a\nsquare URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely\nconstrained EBRD. Simulation results confirm that a wide or tall URA achieves a\nsum rate of 3.5 X more than that of a square URA, benefiting from the extended\nEBRD and improved spatial multiplexing capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u6bb5\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u6ce2\u675f\u805a\u7126\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u5747\u5300\u77e9\u5f62\u9635\u5217\uff08URA\uff09\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9635\u5217\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5bf9\u8fd1\u573a\u6ce2\u675f\u805a\u7126\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ad8\u9891\u6bb5\u5927\u578b\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u8f90\u5c04\u8fd1\u573a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd1\u573a\u6ce2\u675f\u805a\u7126\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u6709\u6548\u6ce2\u675f\u805a\u7126\u745e\u5229\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08EBRD\uff09\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u8fd1\u573a\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684URA\u5bf9\u6ce2\u675f\u6df1\u5ea6\u548cEBRD\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u5f62URA\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6df1\u5ea6\u6700\u7a84\uff0c\u4f46EBRD\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u5bbd\u6216\u9ad8\u7684URA\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316EBRD\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u7528\u6237\u603b\u901f\u7387\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5bbd\u6216\u9ad8\u7684URA\u7684\u603b\u901f\u7387\u662f\u65b9\u5f62URA\u76843.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bbd\u6216\u9ad8\u7684URA\u5728\u8fd1\u573a\u6ce2\u675f\u805a\u7126\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

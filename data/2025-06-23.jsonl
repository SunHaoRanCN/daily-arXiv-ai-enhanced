However,\nextracting accurate CBF from SCOS necessitates precise noise pre-calibration.\nErrors from this can degrade CBF measurement fidelity, particularly when the\noverall signal level is low. Such errors primarily stem from residual speckle\ncontrast associated with camera and shot noise, whose fluctuations exhibit a\ntemporal structure that mimics cerebral blood volume (CBV) waveforms. We\npropose an optimization-based framework that performs an adaptive refinement of\nnoise calibration, mitigating the CBV-mimicking artifacts by reducing the\nCBF-CBV waveform correlation. Validated on 10 human subjects, our approach\neffectively lowered the signal threshold for reliable CBF signal from 97 to 26\nelectrons per pixel for a 1920x1200 pixels SCOS system.

This two-part paper revisits and extends the ChannelComp\nframework, a general methodology for computing arbitrary finite-valued\nfunctions using digital modulation. In Part I, we develop a novel constellation\ndesign approach that is aware of the noise distribution and formulates the\nencoder design as a max-min optimization problem using noise-tailored distance\nmetrics.

However, utilizing an efficient method to solve this problem using a\nlow-range dataset and processing load is beneficial. This paper proposes a\nsolution using a Mamba-based state-space model and four fine-tuned\nself-supervised models consisting of Wav2Vec2, WavLM, HuBERT, and Whisper to\naddress the dual challenges of whispered speech and dialect diversity. Based on\nour knowledge, this represents the best performance reported on the wTIMIT and\nCHAINS datasets for whispered speech recognition. We trained the models using\nwhispered and normal speech data across Singaporean, US, and Irish dialects.\nThe findings demonstrated that utilizing the proposed Mamba-based model could\nwork as a highly efficient model trained with low amounts of whispered data to\nsimultaneously work on whispered and normal speech recognition.

We\ndelve into the design of energy-efficient passive beamforming (PBF) strategies\nwithin RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point (CoMP)-NOMA networks. Two distinct\nRIS configurations, namely, enhancement-only PBF (EO) and enhancement &\ncancellation PBF (EC), are proposed and analyzed.

In this paper, we introduce the\nITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that\nintegrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over\nthe mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference,\nour approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level\nadjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both\nblack-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and\ndemonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles.\nThrough objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative\nanalysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that\nITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability.\nOur framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for\nmastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the\ninitial style transfer."}

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of five\nstate-of-the-art audio foundation models across six musical corpora spanning\nWestern popular, Greek, Turkish, and Indian classical traditions. We employ\nthree complementary methodologies to investigate these models' cross-cultural\ncapabilities: probing to assess inherent representations, targeted supervised\nfine-tuning of 1-2 layers, and multi-label few-shot learning for low-resource\nscenarios. Our analysis shows varying cross-cultural generalization, with\nlarger models typically outperforming on non-Western music, though results\ndecline for culturally distant traditions. Notably, our approaches achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on five out of six evaluated datasets,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of foundation models for world music\nunderstanding. We also find that our targeted fine-tuning approach does not\nconsistently outperform probing across all settings, suggesting foundation\nmodels already encode substantial musical knowledge. Our evaluation framework\nand benchmarking results contribute to understanding how far current models are\nfrom achieving universal music representations while establishing metrics for\nfuture progress."}

For labeled random finite sets multi-object\nfilters, prior work has been established to construct a labeled multi-object\nbirth density using measurements from multiple sensors.

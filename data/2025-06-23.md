### [1] [Optimized cerebral blood flow measurement in speckle contrast optical spectroscopy via refinement of noise calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15843)
*Ninghe Liu,Yu Xi Huang,Simon Mahler,Changhuei Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化框架，通过自适应噪声校准减少CBV波形模拟的伪影，提高SCOS中CBF测量的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCOS用于监测CBF时，噪声校准误差会导致测量失真，尤其是在低信号水平下。

Method: 采用优化框架自适应调整噪声校准，降低CBF-CBV波形相关性。

Result: 在10名受试者中验证，信号阈值从97降至26电子/像素，提高了测量可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了SCOS在低信号和大SD距离下的CBF测量准确性。

Abstract: Speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS) offers a non-invasive and
cost-effective method for monitoring cerebral blood flow (CBF). However,
extracting accurate CBF from SCOS necessitates precise noise pre-calibration.
Errors from this can degrade CBF measurement fidelity, particularly when the
overall signal level is low. Such errors primarily stem from residual speckle
contrast associated with camera and shot noise, whose fluctuations exhibit a
temporal structure that mimics cerebral blood volume (CBV) waveforms. We
propose an optimization-based framework that performs an adaptive refinement of
noise calibration, mitigating the CBV-mimicking artifacts by reducing the
CBF-CBV waveform correlation. Validated on 10 human subjects, our approach
effectively lowered the signal threshold for reliable CBF signal from 97 to 26
electrons per pixel for a 1920x1200 pixels SCOS system. This improvement
enables more accurate and robust CBF measurements in SCOS, especially at large
source-detector (SD) distances for deeper tissue interrogation.

### [2] [On Designing Modulation for Over-the-Air Computation -- Part I: Noise-Aware Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15950)
*Saeed Razavikia,Carlo Fischione*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数字调制的噪声感知星座设计方法，用于无线多址信道中的空中计算，显著降低了均方误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字空中计算方法设计复杂且频谱效率不足，而模拟方法易受噪声和硬件限制。

Method: 提出噪声感知的星座设计，采用最大最小优化问题，支持高斯、拉普拉斯和重尾噪声模型。

Result: 噪声感知设计在噪声多址信道上比现有数字方法显著降低均方误差。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模数字空中计算提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) leverages the physical superposition property
of wireless multiple access channels (MACs) to compute functions while
communication occurs, enabling scalable and low-latency processing in
distributed networks. While analog OAC methods suffer from noise sensitivity
and hardware constraints, existing digital approaches are often limited in
design complexity, which may hinder scalability and fail to exploit spectral
efficiency fully. This two-part paper revisits and extends the ChannelComp
framework, a general methodology for computing arbitrary finite-valued
functions using digital modulation. In Part I, we develop a novel constellation
design approach that is aware of the noise distribution and formulates the
encoder design as a max-min optimization problem using noise-tailored distance
metrics. Our design supports noise models, including Gaussian, Laplace, and
heavy-tailed distributions. We further demonstrate that, for heavy-tailed
noise, the optimal ChannelComp setup coincides with the solution to the
corresponding max-min criterion for the channel noise with heavy-tailed
distributions. Numerical experiments confirm that our noise-aware design
achieves a substantially lower mean-square error than leading digital OAC
methods over noisy MACs. In Part II, we consider a constellation design with a
quantization-based sampling scheme to enhance modulation scalability and
computational accuracy for large-scale digital OAC.

### [3] [Theoretical Analysis of Near-Field MIMO Channel Capacity and Mid-Band Experimental Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15972)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了近场MIMO通信的容量问题，通过理论分析和实验验证，揭示了近场信道容量随距离增加而下降的规律，并指出大规模MIMO在近场通信中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MIMO阵列规模和载波频率的增加，近场MIMO通信在6G网络中变得至关重要，因此研究近场MIMO容量具有重要意义。

Method: 首先从电磁信息角度建立近场信道模型，然后基于均匀平面阵列（UPA）和有效自由度（EDoF）理论分析信道容量，并通过13 GHz频段的实验进行数值验证。

Result: 研究发现，UPA型MIMO系统的信道容量随通信距离增加而持续下降，大规模MIMO在近场通信中能带来明显容量增益，但接收端天线阵列较小时增益有限。

Conclusion: 该研究为近场通信系统提供了理论参考，强调了大规模MIMO在近场通信中的潜力。

Abstract: With the increase of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) array size and
carrier frequency, near-field MIMO communications will become crucial in 6G
wireless networks. Due to the increase of MIMO near-field range, the research
of near-field MIMO capacity has aroused wide interest. In this paper, we focus
on the theoretical analysis and empirical study of near-field MIMO capacity.
First, the near-field channel model is characterized from the electromagnetic
information perspective. Second, with the uniform planar array (UPA), the
channel capacity based on effective degree of freedom (EDoF) is analyzed
theoretically, and the closed-form analytical expressions are derived in
detail. Finally, based on the numerical verification of near-field channel
measurement experiment at 13 GHz band, we reveal that the channel capacity of
UPA-type MIMO systems decreases continuously with the communication distance
increasing. It can be observed that the near-field channel capacity gain is
relatively obvious when large-scale MIMO is adopted at both receiving and
transmitter ends, but the near-field channel capacity gain may be limited in
the actual communication system with the small antenna array at receiving end.
This work will give some reference to the near-field communication systems.

### [4] [Exploiting Both Pilots and Data Payloads for Integrated Sensing and Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15998)

Conclusion: 利用数据负载信号进行感知任务能显著提升性能，为未来6G网络的ISAC系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is one of the key enabling
technologies in future sixth-generation (6G) networks. Current ISAC systems
predominantly rely on deterministic pilot signals within the signal frame to
accomplish sensing tasks. However, these pilot signals typically occupy only a
small portion, e.g., 0.15% to 25%, of the time-frequency resources. To enhance
the system utility, a promising solution is to repurpose the extensive random
data payload signals for sensing tasks. In this paper, we analyze the ISAC
performance of a multi-antenna system where both deterministic pilot and random
data symbols are employed for sensing tasks. By capitalizing on random matrix
theory (RMT), we first derive a semi-closed-form asymptotic expression of the
ergodic linear minimum mean square error (ELMMSE). Then, we formulate an ISAC
precoding optimization problem to minimize the ELMMSE, which is solved via a
specifically tailored successive convex approximation (SAC) algorithm. To
provide system insights, we further derive a closed-form expression for the
asymptotic ELMMSE at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our analysis reveals
that, compared with conventional sensing implemented by deterministic signals,
the sensing performance degradation induced by random signals is critically
determined by the ratio of the transmit antenna size to the data symbol length.
Based on this result, the ISAC precoding optimization problem at high SNRs is
transformed into a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved.
Simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived asymptotic expressions
of ELMMSE and the performance of the proposed precoding schemes. Particularly,
by leveraging data payload signals for sensing tasks, the sensing error is
reduced by up to 5.6 dB compared to conventional pilot-based sensing.

Conclusion: 本文为智能可扩展的ISAC架构提供了理论基础，并指出了未来研究方向，以推动其在实际网络中的部署。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key feature for
sixth-generation (6G) networks, providing an opportunity to meet the dual
demands of communication and sensing. Existing ISAC research primarily focuses
on baseband optimization at individual access points, with limited attention to
the roles of electromagnetic (EM) shaping and network-wide coordination. The
intricate interdependencies between these domains remain insufficiently
explored, leaving their full potential for enhancing ISAC performance largely
untapped. To bridge this gap, we consider multi-domain ISAC optimization
integrating EM shaping, baseband processing, and network cooperation strategies
that facilitate efficient resource management and system-level design. We
analyze the fundamental trade-offs between these domains and offer insights
into domain-specific and cross-domain strategies contributing to ISAC
performance and efficiency. We then conduct a case study demonstrating the
effectiveness of joint multi-domain optimization. Finally, we discuss key
challenges and future research directions to connect theoretical advancements
and practical ISAC deployments. This work paves the way for intelligent and
scalable ISAC architectures, providing critical insights for their seamless
integration into next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: It is envisioned that 6G networks will be supported by key architectural
principles, including intelligence, decentralization, interoperability, and

AI-RAN framework whose performance is evaluated through a practical scenario
focused on intelligent orchestration and resource optimization. Besides, the
paper reviews the evolution of RAN architectures and sheds light on key
enablers of AI-RAN including digital twins (DTs), intelligent reflecting
surfaces (IRSs), large generative AI (GenAI) models, and blockchain (BC).
Furthermore, it discusses the deployment challenges of AI-RAN, including
technical and regulatory perspectives, and outlines future research directions
incorporating technologies such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
and agentic AI.

### [7] [Multigroup Multicast Design for Pinching-Antenna Systems: Waveguide-Division or Waveguide-Multiplexing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16184)
*Shan Shan,Chongjun Ouyang,Yong Li,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于PASS的多组多播通信设计框架，通过WD和WM两种架构优化多播速率，并提出了相应的波束成形和功率分配算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PASS系统中多组多播通信的设计问题，以最大化多播速率。

Method: 1) WD架构：采用元素级顺序优化策略和log-sum-exp投影梯度下降算法；2) WM架构：基于MM框架处理非光滑和非凸问题，并开发低复杂度优化方法。

Result: 数值结果表明，PASS的WD和WM架构在多播速率上优于传统MIMO技术，WM在密集部署中更稳健，WD在用户组空间分离时表现更优。

Conclusion: PASS系统在多播通信中具有显著优势，WD和WM架构各有适用场景。

Abstract: This article addresses the design of multigroup multicast communications in
the pinching-antenna system (PASS). A PASS-enabled multigroup transmission
framework is proposed to maximize multicast rates under a couple of
transmission architectures: waveguide-division (WD) and waveguide-multiplexing
(WM). 1) For WD, an element-wise sequential optimization strategy is proposed
for pinching beamforming, i.e., optimizing the activated positions of pinching
antennas along dielectric waveguides. Meanwhile, a log-sum-exp projected
gradient descent algorithm is proposed for transmit power allocation across
waveguides. 2) For WM, a majorization-minimization (MM)-based framework is
proposed to tackle the problem's non-smoothness and non-convexity. On this
basis, a low-complexity element-wise sequential optimization method is
developed for pinching beamforming using the MM surrogate objective.
Furthermore, the optimal transmit beamformer structure is derived from the MM
surrogate objective using the Lagrange duality, with an efficient transmit
beamforming algorithm proposed using projected adaptive gradient descent.
Numerical results demonstrate that: i) both WD and WM architectures in PASS
achieve significant multicast rate improvements over conventional MIMO
techniques, especially for systems with large service areas; ii) WM is more
robust than WD in dense deployments, while WD excels when user groups are
spatially separated.

### [8] [DCFNet: Doppler Correction Filter Network for Integrated Sensing and Communication in Multi-User MIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16191)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DCFNet的AI原生ISAC模型，用于解决OFDM系统中多普勒效应引起的ICI问题，并通过DCFNet-LR进一步提升了范围和速度分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决OFDM系统中多普勒效应导致的ICI问题，提升ISAC的感知精度。

Method: 提出DCFNet模型，结合多用户MIMO OFDM系统，通过Doppler-Correction Filter和深度学习网络抑制ICI，并引入DCFNet-LR进行局部优化。

Result: DCFNet-LR比最大似然搜索快143倍，范围和速度RMSE分别降低至2.7×10^-4和6.7×10^-4倍。

Conclusion: DCFNet和DCFNet-LR显著提升了ISAC的感知性能，同时保持了低复杂度。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a headline feature for the
forthcoming IMT-2030 and 6G releases, yet a concrete solution that fits within
the established orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) family
remains open. Specifically, Doppler-induced inter-carrier interference (ICI)
destroys sub-carrier orthogonality of OFDM sensing signals, blurring
range-velocity maps and severely degrading sensing accuracy. Building on
multi-user multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) OFDM systems, this paper proposes
Doppler-Correction Filter Network (DCFNet), an AI-native ISAC model that
delivers fine range-velocity resolution at minimal complexity without altering
the legacy frame structure. A bank of DCFs first shifts dominant ICI energy
away from critical Doppler bins; a compact deep learning network then
suppresses the ICI. To further enhance the range and velocity resolutions, we
propose DCFNet with local refinement (DCFNet-LR), which applies a generalized
likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to refine target estimates of DCFNet to sub-cell
accuracy. Simulation results show that DCFNet-LR runs $143\times$ faster than
maximum likelihood search and achieves significantly superior performance,
reducing the range RMSE by up to $2.7 \times 10^{-4}$ times and the velocity
RMSE by $6.7 \times 10^{-4}$ times compared to conventional detection methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星探索任务需要可靠的通信系统，但极端环境条件（如沙尘暴、多普勒效应和资源限制）对传统方法构成挑战。

Method: MASC系统包括环境感知混合预编码、自适应参数映射和鲁棒通信预编码，采用多目标优化方法。

Result: MASC在恶劣条件下保持45%感知覆盖率（传统方法仅5%），SINR提升2.5 dB，容量提高80%。

Conclusion: MASC为6G时代的非地面网络提供了集成感知与通信的可行方案，平衡环境感知与高可靠性传输。

Abstract: Mars exploration missions increasingly demand reliable communication systems,
yet harsh environmental conditions -- particularly frequent dust storms,
extreme Doppler effects, and stringent resource constraints -- pose
unprecedented challenges to conventional communication approaches. This paper
presents the Martian Adaptive Sensing and Communication (MASC) system
specifically designed for the Martian environment. MASC establishes a
physically interpretable channel model and develops three key components:
environment-aware hybrid precoding, adaptive parameter mapping, and robust
communication precoding. Simulation results demonstrate that MASC maintains 45
percent sensing coverage under severe dust conditions compared to only 5
percent with conventional methods, provides up to 2.5 dB
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) improvement at 50 percent
channel state information (CSI) uncertainty, and yields 80 percent higher
capacity in moderate dust storms. Using an epsilon-constraint multi-objective
optimization approach, we enable mission planners to select operational modes
ranging from communication-priority (0.33 bps/Hz capacity, 28 percent sensing
coverage) to sensing-priority (90 percent coverage with minimal capacity),
offering a versatile framework that balances environmental awareness with
hyper-reliable data transmission. This work provides a validated blueprint for
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in non-terrestrial networks (NTN),
a key enabler for achieving ubiquitous connectivity in the 6G era.

### [10] [On Designing Modulation for Over-the-Air Computation -- Part II: Pyramid Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16208)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种金字塔采样策略，用于降低大规模边缘网络中数字OAC星座设计的复杂性，通过选择部分叠加星座点，将复杂度从$\mathcal{O}(q^K)$降至$\mathcal{O}(q^{K-p+1})$，并在对称聚合假设下实现计算复杂性与计算精度的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模边缘网络中数字OAC星座设计的高复杂性和量化挑战。

Method: 引入金字塔采样策略，选择部分叠加星座点以减少设计复杂度，并提出基于多数采样的特殊方案（$p=K$）。

Result: 通过多种模拟验证，中等采样顺序在性能可接受的情况下显著减少了约束数量。

Conclusion: 金字塔采样策略有效降低了数字OAC星座设计的复杂性，同时保持了计算精度。

Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) harnesses the natural superposition of
wireless signals to compute aggregate functions during transmission, thereby
collapsing communication and computation into a single step and significantly
reducing latency and resource usage. In Part I, digital OAC was formulated as a
noise-aware constellation design problem by casting encoder design as a max-min
optimization that aligns minimum Euclidean distances between superimposed
constellation points with squared differences of their corresponding function
outputs.
  In this paper, Part II, we address the prohibitive complexity and
quantization challenges inherent in digital OAC constellation design for
large-scale edge networks. More precisely, we introduce a pyramid sampling
strategy that judiciously selects a subset of superimposed constellation points
to reduce the encoder design complexity from $\mathcal{O}(q^K)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(q^{K-p+1})$, where $p\in\{1,\dots, K\}$ denotes the sampling
order, $q$ levels of modulation, and $K$ denotes the number nodes in the
network. Under the assumption of symmetric aggregation, this approach enables a
controlled trade-off between computational complexity and function computation
accuracy. As a special case, we propose majority-based sampling ($p=K$), which
confines aggregation to only $q$ consensus points, inherently avoiding
destructive overlaps and permitting the use of standard digital modulations
(e.g., QAM, PSK, ASK) without bespoke constellation designs. We also show via
several simulations, across various aggregation functions, modulation levels,
and noise levels, that moderate sampling orders attain acceptable performance
with orders-of-magnitude fewer constraints than exhaustive designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FRMCS作为新的无线铁路通信标准，其性能直接影响部署成本和长期基础设施效果，因此需要准确模拟真实环境中的无线电链路。

Method: 作者开发了动态射线追踪工具，结合物理光学方法，模拟列车在城市场景中移动时的无线电链路，并考虑了轨道附近物体（如电线杆）的影响。

Result: 案例研究表明，金属电线杆的散射对无线电链路有显著影响。

Conclusion: 改进的射线追踪工具能更准确地模拟FRMCS在复杂环境中的性能，为部署提供可靠依据。

Abstract: The upcoming roll-out of the new wireless communication standard for wireless
railway services, FRMCS, requires a thorough understanding of the system
performance in real-world conditions, since this will strongly influence the
deployment costs and the effectiveness of an infrastructure planned for
decades. The virtual testing of the equipment and network performance in
realistic simulated scenarios is key; its accuracy depends on the reliability
of the predicted radio channel properties. In this article, the authors explain
how they are evolving a ray-tracing (RT) tool to apply it to the specific case
of simulating the radio link between the FRMCS fixed infrastructure and an
antenna placed on the roof of a train moving in an urban environment. First, a
dynamic version of the RT tool is used to capture the rapid variations of all
channel metrics; a compromise is sought between computation time and accuracy.
Besides, a hybridization of RT and physical optics (PO) allows the integration
of objects near the track, such as catenary pylons, into the simulation. A case
study shows that the scattering by metallic pylons brings a significant
contribution.

Conclusion: 基于均值场优化的评估有望对6G和NextG标准化产生积极影响。

Abstract: The full-scale 6G standardization has attracted considerable recent
attention, especially since the first 3GPP-wide 6G workshop held in March 2025.
To understand the practical and fundamental values of 6G and facilitate its
standardization, it is crucial to explore the theoretical limits of spectrum,
energy, and coverage efficiency considering practical hardware and signaling
constraints. In this paper, we present a mean-field-approximation-based
investigation on two out of six use case scenarios defined by IMT-2030, namely,
massive communication and ubiquitous connectivity. Being aware of the
limitation in interference cancellation owing to constrained cost and hardware
complexity, we investigate the spectrum reuse architecture in both usage
scenarios. We propose a tractable spectrum reuse with low signaling overhead
consumed for channel estimation and channel state information (CSI) feedback.
Our analysis indicates that the massive communication over cellular and
device-to-device (D2D) networks can benefit from channel orthogonalization,
while it is unnecessary to share the CSI of interfering links. Moreover,
deploying relays or movable base stations, e.g. unmanned aerial vehicle, yields
substantial energy and spectrum gain for ubiquitous connectivity, despite
introducing interference. As such, the mean-field-optimization-based evaluation
is expected to positively impact 6G and NextG standardization in 3GPP and other
standardization bodies.

Motivation: Capon和MMSE波束形成器在信号功率估计中存在偏差问题，无法随着样本量增加而渐近无偏。

Method: 提出了一种改进的Capon⁺波束形成器，通过最小化信号功率估计的均方误差来优化缩放因子。

Result: Capon⁺波束形成器在信号功率和波形估计之间取得了更好的平衡，且偏差最小，随着样本量增加趋近于零。

Conclusion: Capon⁺波束形成器在信号功率估计中表现优于传统Capon和MMSE波束形成器，解决了偏差问题。

Abstract: We study the properties of beamformers in their ability to either maintain or
estimate the true signal power of the signal of interest (SOI). Our focus is
particularly on the Capon beamformer and the minimum mean squared error (MMSE)
beamformer. The Capon beamformer, also known as the minimum power
distortionless response (MPDR) or the minimum variance distortionless response
(MVDR) beamformer, is a widely used method in array signal processing. A
curious feature of both the Capon and the MMSE beamformers is their tendency to
either overestimate or underestimate the signal power. That is, they are not
asymptotically unbiased (as the sample size approaches infinity). To address
this issue, we propose to shrink the Capon beamformer by finding a scaling
factor that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) of the signal power
estimate. The new beamformer, referred to as the Capon$^+$ beamformer, is
evaluated against the Capon and MMSE beamformers in terms of bias, signal power
MSE, and signal waveform MSE. The Capon$^+$ beamformer strikes a better balance
between signal power and waveform estimation while also exhibiting minimal
bias, which approaches zero as the sample size increases.

*Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe,Bruno S. Chang,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为ISAC系统在双分散信道中设计高效接收方案。

Method: 基于GaBP框架，仅使用标量操作进行符号检测。

Result: 在BER和OOBE方面优于AFDM。

Conclusion: AFBM结合GaBP在双分散信道中表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a low-complexity receiver structure for the recently introduced
Affine Filter Bank Modulation (AFBM) scheme, which is a novel waveform designed
for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems operating in
doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. The proposed receiver structure is based on
the Gaussian Belief Propagation (GaBP) framework, making use of only
element-wise scalar operations to perform detection of the transmitted symbols.
Simulation results demonstrate that AFBM in conjunction with GaBP outperforms
affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) in terms of bit error rates
(BERs) in DD channels, while achieving very low out-of-band emissions (OOBE) in
high-mobility scenarios.

### [16] [Searching for a Hidden Markov Anomaly over Multiple Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17108)
*Levli Citron,Kobi Cohen,Qing Zhao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于隐马尔可夫模型的异常检测算法（ADHM），用于在多个过程中动态识别异常过程，最小化检测时间并满足错误概率约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设观测独立同分布，但实际异常可能随时间动态变化，因此需要一种能利用时间相关性的新方法。

Method: 提出ADHM算法，通过动态调整探测策略，结合统计证据和隐状态预测更新，聚焦于信息量最大的过程。

Result: 理论分析表明ADHM在已知隐状态分布下接近最优性能，实验显示其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ADHM通过利用时间相关性，显著提升了异常检测效率，适用于动态变化的异常场景。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting an anomalous process among a large number
of processes. At each time t, normal processes are in state zero (normal
state), while the abnormal process may be in either state zero (normal state)
or state one (abnormal state), with the states being hidden. The transition
between states for the abnormal process is governed by a Markov chain over
time. At each time step, observations can be drawn from a selected subset of
processes. Each probed process generates an observation depending on its hidden
state, either a typical distribution under state zero or an abnormal
distribution under state one. The objective is to design a sequential search
strategy that minimizes the expected detection time, subject to an error
probability constraint. In contrast to prior works that assume i.i.d.
observations, we address a new setting where anomalies evolve according to a
hidden Markov model. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm, dubbed Anomaly
Detection under Hidden Markov model (ADHM), which dynamically adapts the
probing strategy based on accumulated statistical evidence and predictive
belief updates over hidden states. ADHM effectively leverages temporal
correlations to focus sensing resources on the most informative processes. The
algorithm is supported by an asymptotic theoretical foundation, grounded in an
oracle analysis that characterizes the fundamental limits of detection under
the assumption of a known distribution of the hidden states. In addition, the
algorithm demonstrates strong empirical performance, consistently outperforming
existing methods in extensive simulations.

Conclusion: RIS辅助的CoMP-NOMA网络是实现未来无线网络高效能的有前景方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the synergistic potential of reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance
the energy efficiency and performance of next-generation wireless networks. We
delve into the design of energy-efficient passive beamforming (PBF) strategies
within RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point (CoMP)-NOMA networks. Two distinct
RIS configurations, namely, enhancement-only PBF (EO) and enhancement &
cancellation PBF (EC), are proposed and analyzed. Our findings demonstrate that
RIS-assisted CoMP-NOMA networks offer significant efficiency gains compared to
traditional CoMP-NOMA systems. Furthermore, we formulate a PBF design problem
to optimize the RIS phase shifts for maximizing energy efficiency. Our results
reveal that the optimal PBF design is contingent upon several factors,
including the number of cooperating base stations (BSs), the number of RIS
elements deployed, and the RIS configuration. This study underscores the
potential of RIS-assisted CoMP-NOMA networks as a promising solution for
achieving superior energy efficiency and overall performance in future wireless
networks.

Motivation: 自适应轨迹初始化是现代多目标跟踪系统的关键部分，但现有方法在计算复杂度上存在不足，尤其是在多传感器场景中。

Method: 提出了五种效率增强技术，用于优化标记随机有限集多传感器自适应出生过程。

Result: 仿真结果表明，这些方法显著降低了计算复杂度，同时对多目标跟踪性能的影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 所提出的效率增强方法在多传感器自适应出生过程中具有实际应用价值，能够显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Adaptive track initiation remains a crucial component of many modern
multi-target tracking systems. For labeled random finite sets multi-object
filters, prior work has been established to construct a labeled multi-object
birth density using measurements from multiple sensors. A naive construction of
this adaptive birth set density results in an exponential number of newborn
components in the number of sensors. A truncation procedure was provided that
leverages a Gibbs sampler to truncate the birth density, reducing the
complexity to quadratic in the number of sensors. However, only a limited
discussion has been provided on additional algorithmic techniques that can be
employed to substantially reduce the complexity in practical tracking
applications. In this paper, we propose five efficiency enhancements for the
labeled random finite sets multi-sensor adaptive birth procedure. Simulation
results are provided to demonstrate their computational benefits and show that
they result in a negligible change to the multi-target tracking performance.

Method: 结合TDOA分割和嵌入聚类，无需多通道训练数据或麦克风配置信息。

Result: 在紧凑和分布式麦克风阵列中显著优于单通道方法，并能正确跟踪移动说话人。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种场景下表现优越，尤其适用于重叠语音和说话人位置变化的情况。

Abstract: We propose a spatio-spectral, combined model-based and data-driven
diarization pipeline consisting of TDOA-based segmentation followed by
embedding-based clustering. The proposed system requires neither access to
multi-channel training data nor prior knowledge about the number or placement
of microphones. It works for both a compact microphone array and distributed
microphones, with minor adjustments. Due to its superior handling of
overlapping speech during segmentation, the proposed pipeline significantly
outperforms the single-channel pyannote approach, both in a scenario with a
compact microphone array and in a setup with distributed microphones.
Additionally, we show that, unlike fully spatial diarization pipelines, the
proposed system can correctly track speakers when they change positions.

### [21] [EDNet: A Distortion-Agnostic Speech Enhancement Framework with Gating Mamba Mechanism and Phase Shift-Invariant Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16231)
*Doyeop Kwak,Youngjoon Jang,Seongyu Kim,Joon Son Chung*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: EDNet是一个通用的语音增强框架，通过结合掩蔽和映射技术，适应多种失真类型，无需任务或输入的先验假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中的语音信号常受多种失真影响，传统方法在特定条件下效果有限，需更通用的解决方案。

Method: EDNet包含Gating Mamba模块（自适应选择掩蔽或重建）和Phase Shift-Invariant Training（改进相位估计）。

Result: 实验表明，EDNet在去噪、去混响、带宽扩展和多失真增强任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: EDNet具有架构灵活性和适应性，适用于多样化的语音增强任务。

Abstract: Speech signals in real-world environments are frequently affected by various
distortions such as additive noise, reverberation, and bandwidth limitation,
which may appear individually or in combination. Traditional speech enhancement
methods typically rely on either masking, which focuses on suppressing
non-speech components while preserving observable structure, or mapping, which
seeks to recover clean speech through direct transformation of the input. Each
approach offers strengths in specific scenarios but may be less effective
outside its target conditions. We propose the Erase and Draw Network (EDNet), a
distortion-agnostic speech enhancement framework designed to handle a broad
range of distortion types without prior assumptions about task or input
characteristics. EDNet consists of two main components: (1) the Gating Mamba
(GM) module, which adaptively combines masking and mapping through a learnable
gating mechanism that selects between suppression (Erase) and reconstruction
(Draw) based on local signal features, and (2) Phase Shift-Invariant Training
(PSIT), a shift tolerant supervision strategy that improves phase estimation by
enabling dynamic alignment during training while remaining compatible with
standard loss functions. Experimental results on denoising, dereverberation,
bandwidth extension, and multi distortion enhancement tasks show that EDNet
consistently achieves strong performance across conditions, demonstrating its
architectural flexibility and adaptability to diverse task settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于ODE的TTS生成需要大量步骤，导致质量与推理速度之间的权衡。RapFlow-TTS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用流匹配训练中的速度一致性约束，结合时间间隔调度和对抗学习技术，减少生成步骤。

Result: 实验显示，RapFlow-TTS在合成步骤上比传统方法减少5-10倍，同时保持高保真语音合成。

Conclusion: RapFlow-TTS成功实现了快速且高质量的语音合成，为TTS领域提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce RapFlow-TTS, a rapid and high-fidelity TTS acoustic model that
leverages velocity consistency constraints in flow matching (FM) training.
Although ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based TTS generation achieves
natural-quality speech, it typically requires a large number of generation
steps, resulting in a trade-off between quality and inference speed. To address
this challenge, RapFlow-TTS enforces consistency in the velocity field along
the FM-straightened ODE trajectory, enabling consistent synthetic quality with
fewer generation steps. Additionally, we introduce techniques such as time
interval scheduling and adversarial learning to further enhance the quality of
the few-step synthesis. Experimental results show that RapFlow-TTS achieves
high-fidelity speech synthesis with a 5- and 10-fold reduction in synthesis
steps than the conventional FM- and score-based approaches, respectively.

Result: 实验显示H-QuEST在检索速度上有显著提升，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: H-QuEST为QbE-STD提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Query-by-example spoken term detection (QbE-STD) searches for matching words
or phrases in an audio dataset using a sample spoken query. When annotated data
is limited or unavailable, QbE-STD is often done using template matching
methods like dynamic time warping (DTW), which are computationally expensive
and do not scale well. To address this, we propose H-QuEST (Hierarchical
Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection), a novel framework that accelerates
spoken term retrieval by utilizing Term Frequency and Inverse Document
Frequency (TF-IDF)-based sparse representations obtained through advanced audio
representation learning techniques and Hierarchical Navigable Small World
(HNSW) indexing with further refinement. Experimental results show that H-QuEST
delivers substantial improvements in retrieval speed without sacrificing
accuracy compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Whispered speech recognition presents significant challenges for conventional
automatic speech recognition systems, particularly when combined with dialect
variation. However, utilizing an efficient method to solve this problem using a
low-range dataset and processing load is beneficial. This paper proposes a
solution using a Mamba-based state-space model and four fine-tuned
self-supervised models consisting of Wav2Vec2, WavLM, HuBERT, and Whisper to
address the dual challenges of whispered speech and dialect diversity. Based on
our knowledge, this represents the best performance reported on the wTIMIT and
CHAINS datasets for whispered speech recognition. We trained the models using
whispered and normal speech data across Singaporean, US, and Irish dialects.
The findings demonstrated that utilizing the proposed Mamba-based model could
work as a highly efficient model trained with low amounts of whispered data to
simultaneously work on whispered and normal speech recognition. The code for

Method: 系统比较了多种池化策略，包括提出的多查询多头注意力统计池化方法，并通过注意力分析定位情感信息。

Result: 新方法在宏F1分数上比平均池化提高了3.5个百分点，发现15%的帧包含80%的情感线索。

Conclusion: 注意力池化不仅性能优越，还能解释情感定位，与人类感知策略一致。

Abstract: State-of-the-art transformer models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) rely
on temporal feature aggregation, yet advanced pooling methods remain
underexplored. We systematically benchmark pooling strategies, including
Multi-Query Multi-Head Attentive Statistics Pooling, which achieves a 3.5
percentage point macro F1 gain over average pooling. Attention analysis shows
15 percent of frames capture 80 percent of emotion cues, revealing a localized
pattern of emotional information. Analysis of high-attention frames reveals
that non-linguistic vocalizations and hyperarticulated phonemes are
disproportionately prioritized during pooling, mirroring human perceptual
strategies. Our findings position attentive pooling as both a performant SER
mechanism and a biologically plausible tool for explainable emotion
localization. On Interspeech 2025 Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic

Method: 分为三个阶段：1) 生成4D场景和单声道音频；2) 通过视觉定位策略估计声源位置；3) 基于物理模拟合成空间音频。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成与4D场景一致的真实空间音频，无需训练。

Conclusion: Sonic4D显著提升了4D场景的沉浸式体验。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 4D generation have demonstrated its remarkable
capability in synthesizing photorealistic renderings of dynamic 3D scenes.
However, despite achieving impressive visual performance, almost all existing
methods overlook the generation of spatial audio aligned with the corresponding
4D scenes, posing a significant limitation to truly immersive audiovisual
experiences. To mitigate this issue, we propose Sonic4D, a novel framework that
enables spatial audio generation for immersive exploration of 4D scenes.
Specifically, our method is composed of three stages: 1) To capture both the
dynamic visual content and raw auditory information from a monocular video, we
first employ pre-trained expert models to generate the 4D scene and its
corresponding monaural audio. 2) Subsequently, to transform the monaural audio
into spatial audio, we localize and track the sound sources within the 4D
scene, where their 3D spatial coordinates at different timestamps are estimated
via a pixel-level visual grounding strategy. 3) Based on the estimated sound
source locations, we further synthesize plausible spatial audio that varies
across different viewpoints and timestamps using physics-based simulation.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method generates
realistic spatial audio consistent with the synthesized 4D scene in a
training-free manner, significantly enhancing the immersive experience for
users. Generated audio and video examples are available at

Abstract: To explore the potential advantages of utilizing spatial cues from images for

VS-Singer, a vision-guided model designed to produce stereo singing voices with
room reverberation from scene images. VS-Singer comprises three modules:
firstly, a modal interaction network integrates spatial features into text
encoding to create a linguistic representation enriched with spatial
information. Secondly, the decoder employs a consistency Schr\"odinger bridge
to facilitate one-step sample generation. Moreover, we utilize the SFE module
to improve the consistency of audio-visual matching. To our knowledge, this
study is the first to combine stereo singing voice synthesis with visual
acoustic matching within a unified framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that VS-Singer can effectively generate stereo singing voices that align with

Conclusion: 该方法在提升构音障碍语音清晰度方面具有潜力，且效率更高。

Abstract: Dysarthria is a neurological disorder that significantly impairs speech
intelligibility, often rendering affected individuals unable to communicate
effectively. This necessitates the development of robust dysarthric-to-regular
speech conversion techniques. In this work, we investigate the utility and
limitations of self-supervised learning (SSL) features and their quantized
representations as an alternative to mel-spectrograms for speech generation.
Additionally, we explore methods to mitigate speaker variability by generating
clean speech in a single-speaker voice using features extracted from WavLM. To
this end, we propose a fully non-autoregressive approach that leverages
Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with Diffusion Transformers to learn a direct
mapping from dysarthric to clean speech. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of discrete acoustic units in improving intelligibility while
achieving faster convergence compared to traditional mel-spectrogram-based
approaches.

Result: 在DIRG数据集上达到98.94%准确率，HIT轴承数据集上实现100%分类准确率。

Conclusion: AeroGPT展示了大规模模型在故障诊断中的潜力，显著优于传统深度学习方法。

Abstract: Aerospace engines, as critical components in aviation and aerospace
industries, require continuous and accurate fault diagnosis to ensure
operational safety and prevent catastrophic failures. While deep learning
techniques have been extensively studied in this context, they output logits or
confidence scores, necessitating post-processing to derive actionable insights.
Furthermore, the potential of large-scale audio models in this domain remains
largely untapped. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AeroGPT, a
novel framework that transfers knowledge from general audio domain to
aero-engine bearing fault diagnosis. AeroGPT is a framework based on
large-scale audio model that incorporates Vibration Signal Alignment (VSA) to
adapt general audio knowledge to domain-specific vibration patterns, and
combines Generative Fault Classification (GFC) to directly output interpretable
fault labels. This approach eliminates the need for post-processing of fault
labels, supports interactive, interpretable, and actionable fault diagnosis,
thereby greatly enhancing industrial applicability. Through comprehensive
experimental validation on two aero-engine bearing datasets, AeroGPT achieved
exceptional performance with 98.94% accuracy on the DIRG dataset and perfect
100% classification on the HIT bearing dataset, surpassing traditional deep
learning approaches. Additional Qualitative analysis validates the
effectiveness of our approach and highlights the potential of large-scale
models to revolutionize fault diagnosis.

Result: 实验表明，VRVQ在噪声条件下优于传统方法，实现了更好的压缩效率和感知质量。

Conclusion: VRVQ框架在噪声鲁棒的语音编码中表现优异，优化了率失真权衡。

Abstract: Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) has become a dominant approach in neural
speech and audio coding, providing high-fidelity compression. However, speech
coding presents additional challenges due to real-world noise, which degrades
compression efficiency. Standard codecs allocate bits uniformly, wasting
bitrate on noise components that do not contribute to intelligibility. This
paper introduces a Variable Bitrate RVQ (VRVQ) framework for noise-robust
speech coding, dynamically adjusting bitrate per frame to optimize
rate-distortion trade-offs. Unlike constant bitrate (CBR) RVQ, our method
prioritizes critical speech components while suppressing residual noise.
Additionally, we integrate a feature denoiser to further improve noise
robustness. Experimental results show that VRVQ improves rate-distortion
trade-offs over conventional methods, achieving better compression efficiency
and perceptual quality in noisy conditions. Samples are available at our

distribution of acoustic transfer function (ATF) is useful when phase
measurements are unreliable or inaccessible and has a wide range of
applications related to spatial audio. We propose a neural-network-based method

is the input and output layers conditioned on source and receiver positions and
frequency and the aggregation module of latent variables, which can be
interpreted as an autoencoder-based extension of the basis expansion of the
sound field. Numerical simulation results indicated that the ATF magnitude is
accurately estimated with a small number of receivers by our proposed method.

Abstract: Language-queried Audio Separation (LASS) employs linguistic queries to
isolate target sounds based on semantic descriptions. However, existing methods
face challenges in aligning complex auditory features with linguistic context
while preserving separation precision. Current research efforts focus primarily
on text description augmentation and architectural innovations, yet the
potential of integrating pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) audio
models and Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) frameworks, capable of
extracting cross-modal audio-text relationships, remains underexplored. To
address this, we present HybridSep, a two-stage LASS framework that synergizes
SSL-based acoustic representations with CLAP-derived semantic embeddings. Our
framework introduces Adversarial Consistent Training (ACT), a novel
optimization strategy that treats diffusion as an auxiliary regularization loss
while integrating adversarial training to enhance separation fidelity.
Experiments demonstrate that HybridSep achieves significant performance
improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., AudioSep, FlowSep) across
multiple metrics, establishing new benchmarks for LASS tasks.

Abstract: Music mastering style transfer aims to model and apply the mastering
characteristics of a reference track to a target track, simulating the
professional mastering process. However, existing methods apply fixed
processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the
results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the
ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that
integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over
the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference,
our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level
adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both
black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and
demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles.
Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative
analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that
ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability.
Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for
mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the
initial style transfer.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized music information retrieval, but
questions remain about their ability to generalize across diverse musical
traditions. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art audio foundation models across six musical corpora spanning
Western popular, Greek, Turkish, and Indian classical traditions. We employ
three complementary methodologies to investigate these models' cross-cultural
capabilities: probing to assess inherent representations, targeted supervised
fine-tuning of 1-2 layers, and multi-label few-shot learning for low-resource
scenarios. Our analysis shows varying cross-cultural generalization, with
larger models typically outperforming on non-Western music, though results
decline for culturally distant traditions. Notably, our approaches achieve
state-of-the-art performance on five out of six evaluated datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of foundation models for world music
understanding. We also find that our targeted fine-tuning approach does not
consistently outperform probing across all settings, suggesting foundation
models already encode substantial musical knowledge. Our evaluation framework
and benchmarking results contribute to understanding how far current models are
from achieving universal music representations while establishing metrics for
future progress.

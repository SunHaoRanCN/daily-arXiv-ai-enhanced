Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation enables simple\nand robust channel compensation under such conditions. However, fractional\ndelay and Doppler components introduce inter-path interference, degrading\nestimation accuracy. We propose a two-stage estimation method based on Prony's\ntechnique using OTFS pilot signals with M subchannels and N pilot repetitions.\nIn the first stage, Doppler frequencies are estimated by jointly solving M\ncoupled Prony equations, exploiting the periodicity of the pilot signal. In the\nsecond stage, delays are estimated by applying the discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT) and Prony's method to each Doppler component obtained in the first stage.\nThe proposed method can accurately estimate up to N-1 delay-Doppler parameters\nunder noiseless conditions. In noisy environments, conventional information\ncriteria such as AIC and BIC yield suboptimal performance; thus, a heuristic\nmodel order selection is adopted. Numerical simulations confirm that the\nproposed method achieves high estimation accuracy, highlighting its potential\nfor future ISAC frameworks."}

The\ndiscrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions\ndegrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied\nto others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has\nbeen introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing\nmulti-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization\napproaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault\nfeatures. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific\nmulti-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect\nfault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the\nextent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely\nstudied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact\non fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the\nmodel to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall\ngeneralization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing\nend-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically\nin variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a\nreal-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed,\naiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant\noperating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with\na retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant\nfault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the\nsource domain. Several experiments on a real-world gearbox dataset are\nconducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

To capture the effect of SNS at the BS side, a stochastic-based\napproach is proposed to model SNS caused by incomplete scattering, by\nestablishing power attenuation factors from visibility probability and\nvisibility region to characterize antenna element-wise path power variation. In\naddition, a physical blocker-based approach is introduced to model SNS effects\ncaused by partial blockage.

We introduce CultureMERT-95M, a multi-culturally adapted foundation\nmodel developed to enhance cross-cultural music representation learning and\nunderstanding. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage continual pre-training\nstrategy that integrates learning rate re-warming and re-decaying, enabling\nstable adaptation even with limited computational resources. Training on a\n650-hour multi-cultural data mix, comprising Greek, Turkish, and Indian music\ntraditions, results in an average improvement of 4.9% in ROC-AUC and AP across\ndiverse non-Western music auto-tagging tasks, surpassing prior\nstate-of-the-art, with minimal forgetting on Western-centric benchmarks. We\nfurther investigate task arithmetic, an alternative approach to multi-cultural\nadaptation that merges single-culture adapted models in the weight space. Task\narithmetic performs on par with our multi-culturally trained model on\nnon-Western auto-tagging tasks and shows no regression on Western datasets.\nCross-cultural evaluation reveals that single-culture models transfer with\nvarying effectiveness across musical traditions, whereas the multi-culturally\nadapted model achieves the best overall performance. To support research on\nworld music representation learning, we publicly release CultureMERT-95M and\nCultureMERT-TA-95M, fostering the development of more culturally aware music\nfoundation models."}

These algorithms are\nusually evaluated at the utterance level, but this approach overlooks the\ndisparities in acoustic characteristics that are observed in different phoneme\ncategories and between male and female speakers. In this paper, we investigate\nthe impact of gender and phonetic content on speech enhancement algorithms. We\nmotivate this approach by outlining phoneme- and gender-specific spectral\nfeatures. Our experiments reveal that while utterance-level differences between\ngenders are minimal, significant variations emerge at the phoneme level.\nResults show that the tested algorithms better reduce interference with fewer\nartifacts on female speech, particularly in plosives, fricatives, and vowels.\nAdditionally, they demonstrate greater performance for female speech in terms\nof perceptual and speech recognition metrics."}

In\nclinical settings, these sounds often interfere with each other, making manual\nseparation difficult and error-prone. The proposed model learns to encode mixed\nsignals into a structured latent space and reconstructs the individual\ncomponents using a probabilistic decoder, all without requiring labeled data or\nprior knowledge of source characteristics. We apply this method to real\nrecordings obtained from a clinical manikin using a digital stethoscope.\nResults demonstrate distinct latent clusters corresponding to heart and lung\nsources, as well as accurate reconstructions that preserve key spectral\nfeatures of the original signals. The approach offers a robust and\ninterpretable solution for blind source separation and has potential\napplications in portable diagnostic tools and intelligent stethoscope systems."}

In this work,\nwe propose perceptually-informed variants of the SDR loss, formulated in the\ntime-frequency domain and modulated by frequency-dependent weighting schemes.\nThese weights are designed to emphasize time-frequency regions where speech is\nprominent or where the interfering noise is particularly strong. We investigate\nboth fixed and adaptive strategies, including ANSI band-importance weights,\nspectral magnitude-based weighting, and dynamic weighting based on the relative\namount of speech and noise. We train the FaSNet multichannel speech enhancement\nmodel using these various losses. Experimental results show that while standard\nmetrics such as the SDR are only marginally improved, their perceptual\nfrequency-weighted counterparts exhibit a more substantial improvement.\nBesides, spectral and phoneme-level analysis indicates better consonant\nreconstruction, which points to a better preservation of certain acoustic cues."}

The key finding is\nthat positional embeddings, which have been seldom used by text-to-music\ngeneration models in the conditioner for text conditions, are critical when the\ncondition of interest is a function of time. Using melody control as an\nexample, our experiments show that simply adding rotary positional embeddings\nto the decoupled cross-attention layers increases control accuracy from 56.6%\nto 61.1%, while requiring 6.75 times fewer trainable parameters than\nstate-of-the-art fine-tuning mechanisms, using the same pre-trained diffusion\nTransformer model of Stable Audio Open.

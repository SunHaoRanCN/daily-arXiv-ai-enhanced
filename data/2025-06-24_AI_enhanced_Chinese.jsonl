We propose a two-stage estimation method based on Prony's\ntechnique using OTFS pilot signals with M subchannels and N pilot repetitions.\nIn the first stage, Doppler frequencies are estimated by jointly solving M\ncoupled Prony equations, exploiting the periodicity of the pilot signal. In the\nsecond stage, delays are estimated by applying the discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT) and Prony's method to each Doppler component obtained in the first stage.\nThe proposed method can accurately estimate up to N-1 delay-Doppler parameters\nunder noiseless conditions.

Despite extensive prior research, incorporating these\nnew features within the standardized channel modeling framework remains an open\nissue. To address this, this paper presents a channel modeling framework for\nXL-MIMO systems that incorporates both near-field and SNS features, adopted by\n3GPP. For the near-field propagation feature, the framework models the\ndistances from the base station (BS) and user equipment to the spherical-wave\nsources associated with clusters. These distances are used to characterize\nelement-wise variations of path parameters, such as nonlinear changes in phase\nand angle. To capture the effect of SNS at the BS side, a stochastic-based\napproach is proposed to model SNS caused by incomplete scattering, by\nestablishing power attenuation factors from visibility probability and\nvisibility region to characterize antenna element-wise path power variation. In\naddition, a physical blocker-based approach is introduced to model SNS effects\ncaused by partial blockage. Finally, a simulation framework for near-field and\nSNS is developed within the structure of the existing 3GPP channel model.\nPerformance evaluations demonstrate that the near-field model captures higher\nchannel capacity potential compared to the far-field model.

Conventional Bayesian\nmultiobject tracking (MOT) methods typically employ a detect-then-track (DTT)\napproach, where a frontend detector preprocesses raw sensor data to extract\nmeasurements for MOT. The irreversible nature of this preprocessing step can\ndiscard valuable object-related information, particularly impairing the ability\nto resolve weak or closely spaced objects. The track-before-detect (TBD)\nparadigm offers an alternative by operating directly on sensor data.

In this paper, we propose to incorporate visual camera data in\naddition to the RF pilots to perform the joint optimization of user association\nand beamforming. The visual image data helps enhance channel awareness, thereby\nreducing the dependency on extensive pilot transmissions for system\noptimization.

Traditional\nwireless receivers have relied on mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference,\nachieving remarkable success in most areas but falling short in their ability\nto characterize channel matrices. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated\nsignificant potential in this aspect. Nevertheless, integrating traditional\ninference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the\nerror progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems,\ngenerative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased\nattention. In this paper, we propose re-evaluating the MIMO-OFDM receiver using\ndiffusion models, which is a common generative approach. With diffusion models,\nwe can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate\ntraditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the\ndiffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the\ndiffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying\nnoise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing\ntraining and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot\ndensities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces\nchannel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading\ndeep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in\nlow-pilot conditions.

Analytical expressions are derived for several standard\narray geometries to enable the design of the large antenna arrays for given\nsystem requirements. First, the near-field beam focusing is analyzed and the\nminimum beamdepth is observed to rapidly saturate to a low asymptotic limit as\nthe array aperture increases. In contrast, the near-field region span is shown\nto scale quadratically with the array aperture. Based on these two metrics, the\nmaximum number of resolvable beamspots at 3 dB separation is derived\nanalytically, exhibiting a linear dependence on the array aperture.

Recent\nefforts have focused on training neural-based SQA models to predict the mean\nopinion score (MOS) of speech samples produced by text-to-speech or voice\nconversion systems.

We propose a novel score aggregation method to address the\nlimitations of conventional annotations for MOS, which typically involve\nratings on a scale from 1 to 5.

By modeling this process, we approximate the generative\ndistribution of ratings by quantizing the latent continuous distribution. We\nthen use the peak of this latent distribution, estimated through the loss\nbetween the quantized distribution and annotated ratings, as a new\nrepresentative value instead of MOS.

However, the bandwidth of these links is limited, and thus,\npresents challenges to the applicability of CF-mMIMO, especially with an\never-increasing number of users. To address this, we propose a method based on\nvariational Bayesian (VB) inference for performing the JED process, where the\nAPs forward low-resolution quantized versions of the signals to the CPU. We\nconsider two approaches: \\emph{quantization-and-estimation} (Q-E) and\n\\emph{estimation-and-quantization} (E-Q). In the Q-E approach, each AP uses a\nlow-bit quantizer to quantize the signal before forwarding it to the CPU, while\nin the E-Q approach, each AP first performs local channel estimation and then\nsends a low-bit quantized version of the estimated channel to the CPU. We\nevaluate the performance of our VB-based approach under perfect fronthaul link\n(PFL) with unquantized received signals, Q-E, and E-Q in terms of symbol error\nrate (SER), normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the channel estimation,\ncomputational complexity, and fronthaul signaling overhead.

During the group dance generation process, however, most existing\nmethods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer\nfoot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this\npaper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to\ngenerate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer\ncollisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the\nrelative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a\ndistance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within\nplausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we\nintroduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design\na Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For\nlong group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling\nstrategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional\ninformation into the noisy input.

USAD offers competitive performance\nacross various benchmarks and datasets, including frame and instance-level\nspeech processing tasks, audio tagging, and sound classification, achieving\nnear state-of-the-art results with a single encoder on SUPERB and HEAR\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "USAD\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u84b8\u998f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u97f3\u9891\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u97f3\u6216\u975e\u8bed\u97f3\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u5230\u5c42\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ece\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u97f3\u9891\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u58f0\u97f3\u3001\u97f3\u4e50\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5e27\u7ea7\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u8bed\u97f3\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u58f0\u97f3\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728SUPERB\u548cHEAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "USAD\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u97f3\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However,\ntraditional signal-related difference measures often fail to capture the\nperceptual properties that are essential to spatial audio quality. This review\npaper surveys recent loss functions that incorporate spatial perception cues\nrelevant to binaural reproduction. It focuses on losses applied to binaural\nsignals, which are often derived from microphone recordings or Ambisonics\nsignals, while excluding those based on room impulse responses. Guided by the\nSpatial Audio Quality Inventory (SAQI), the review emphasizes perceptual\ndimensions related to source localization and room response, while excluding\ngeneral spectral-temporal attributes. The literature survey reveals a strong\nfocus on localization cues, such as interaural time and level differences\n(ITDs, ILDs), while reverberation and other room acoustic attributes remain\nless explored in loss function design. Recent works that estimate room acoustic\nparameters and develop embeddings that capture room characteristics indicate\ntheir potential for future integration into neural network training. The paper\nconcludes by highlighting future research directions toward more perceptually\ngrounded loss functions that better capture the listener's spatial experience."}

In\nthe weak turbulence regime, the probability density function describing the\ndistribution of the channel fading coefficient that models these four effects\nis known in the literature. This function is an integral equation, which makes\nit difficult to find simple analytical expressions of important performance\nmetrics such as the bit error rate (BER) and symbol error rate (SER).

Such\nrates can be achieved by increasing the system bandwidth or the modulation\nformat, which in turn requires maintaining or increasing the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR). Such SNR requirements can be achieved by increasing the\ntransmitted optical power. This increase in optical power causes the emergence\nof relative intensity noise (RIN), a signal-dependent impairment inherent to\nthe transmitter laser, which ultimately limits the performance of the system.\nIn this paper, we develop an analytical symbol error rate (SER) expression for\nthe optimal detector for the IM-DD optical link under study. The developed\nexpression takes into account the signal-dependent nature of RIN and does not\nmake any assumptions on the geometry or probability distribution of the\nconstellation.

Because the fundamental frequency (F0), a\nphysical correlate of pitch, is one of the essential features of speech, there\nhas been particular interest in characterizing the FFR at F0, especially when\nF0 varies over time. The standard method for extracting F0 in FFRs has been the\nAutocorrelation Function (ACF). This paper investigates\nharmonic-structure-based F0 estimation algorithms, originally developed for\nspeech and music, and resolves their poor performance when applied to FFRs in\ntwo steps. Firstly, given that unlike in speech or music, stimulus F0 of FFRs\nis already known, we introduce a stimulus-aware filterbank that selectively\naggregates amplitudes at F0 and its harmonics while suppressing noise at\nnon-harmonic frequencies. This method, called Harmonic Amplitude Summation\n(HAS), evaluates F0 candidates only within a range centered around the stimulus\nF0. Secondly, unlike other pitch tracking methods that select the highest peak,\nour method chooses the most prominent one, as it better reflects the underlying\nperiodicity of FFRs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to\npropose an F0 estimation algorithm for FFRs that relies on harmonic structure.\nAnalyzing recorded FFRs from 16 normal hearing subjects to 4 natural speech\nstimuli with a wide F0 variation from 89 Hz to 452 Hz showed that this method\noutperformed ACF by reducing the average Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) within\neach response and stimulus F0 contour pair by 8.8% to 47.4%, depending on the\nstimulus."}

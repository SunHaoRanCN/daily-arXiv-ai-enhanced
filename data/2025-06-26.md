### [1] [A Multi-Modal Spatial Risk Framework for EV Charging Infrastructure Using Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19860)
*Oktay Karakuş,Padraig Corcoran*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RSERI-EV的多模态风险评估框架，用于评估电动汽车充电站在环境和基础设施压力下的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车充电基础设施对可持续交通系统至关重要，但其在环境和基础设施压力下的韧性尚未充分研究。

Method: 结合遥感数据、开放基础设施数据集和空间图分析，生成综合韧性评分，并通过空间k近邻图进行诊断。

Result: 在威尔士的充电站数据集上验证了框架的可行性，展示了多源数据融合和空间推理的价值。

Conclusion: RSERI-EV框架为气候韧性和基础设施感知的电动汽车部署提供了支持。

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to
sustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and
infrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce
RSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that
combines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph
analytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV
integrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface
temperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover
(LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate
a composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales
EV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest
neighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable
neighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype
highlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial
reasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.

### [2] [Revisiting R: Statistical Envelope Analysis for Lightweight RF Modulation Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19956)
*Srinivas Rahul Sapireddy,Mostafizur Rahman*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文重新探讨了调制分类中的R值方法，通过统计方法和信号变换（Hilbert变换和STFT）显著提高了分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调制分类方法计算复杂且资源消耗大，而1985年提出的R值方法虽理论有效但未充分利用。本文旨在优化R值方法以提升分类性能。

Method: 扩展R值分析，结合Hilbert变换和STFT处理信号，测试了30万信号样本（AM、DSB、SSB各10万）。

Result: Hilbert变换后分类准确率平均为AM 98.60%、DSB 97.30%、SSB 97.90%；STFT后进一步提升至AM 98.80%、DSB 99.10%、SSB 99.00%。

Conclusion: 优化后的R值方法显著提高了调制分类准确率，尤其在信号变换后表现更优。

Abstract: Modulation classification plays a crucial role in wireless communication
systems, enabling applications such as cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring,
and electronic warfare. Conventional techniques often involve deep learning or
complex feature extraction, which, while effective, require substantial
computational resources and memory. An early approach by Chan and Gadbois in
1985 introduced a theoretical method for modulation classification using a
mathematically derived parameter called R. The authors proved that the R value
- the ratio of the variance to the square of the mean of the signal envelope -
can be a distinguishing feature for classification. In this work, we revisit
the R value and show that classification accuracy can be improved further
through statistical methods. We extend R-value analysis to demonstrate its
effectiveness even after signals are transformed using the Hilbert transform
followed by the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Our analysis includes
testing on 300000 signals across AM, DSB, and SSB classes, with each class
having 100000 random variations. On average, we achieve 98.60, 97.30, and 97.90
percent classification accuracy for AM, DSB, and SSB signals after applying the
Hilbert transform. Similar or better accuracies are observed after applying the
STFT, reaching 98.80, 99.10, and 99.00 percent, respectively, for AM, DSB, and
SSB types.

### [3] [Posterior Cramér-Rao Bounds on Localization and Mapping Errors in Distributed MIMO SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19957)
*Benjamin J. B. Deutschmann,Xuhong Li,Florian Meyer,Erik Leitinger*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文推导了RF-SLAM中映射误差界（MEB），即后验Cramér-Rao下界，用于评估镜面反射面的位置和方向性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献缺乏对地图信息性能界限的研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 考虑单次和双次反射以及分布式锚点的通用场景，推导MEB。

Result: 数值实验表明，先进的RF-SLAM算法渐近收敛于MEB。

Conclusion: MEB为RF-SLAM算法的定位和映射性能提供了全局特征评估。

Abstract: Radio-frequency simultaneous localization and mapping (RF-SLAM) methods
jointly infer the position of mobile transmitters and receivers in wireless
networks, together with a geometric map of the propagation environment. An
inferred map of specular surfaces can be used to exploit non-line-of-sight
components of the multipath channel to increase robustness, bypass
obstructions, and improve overall communication and positioning performance.
While performance bounds for user location are well established, the literature
lacks performance bounds for map information. This paper derives the mapping
error bound (MEB), i.e., the posterior Cram\'er-Rao lower bound on the position
and orientation of specular surfaces, for RF-SLAM. In particular, we consider a
very general scenario with single- and double-bounce reflections, as well as
distributed anchors. We demonstrate numerically that a state-of-the-art RF-SLAM
algorithm asymptotically converges to this MEB. The bounds assess not only the
localization (position and orientation) but also the mapping performance of
RF-SLAM algorithms in terms of global features.

### [4] [Near-Field SWIPT Using XL-MIMO: Power Allocation and Subarray Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20050)
*Muhammad Zeeshan Mumtaz,Mohammadali Mohammadi,Hien Quoc Ngo,Michail Matthaiou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了模块化超大规模多输入多输出（XL-MIMO）系统在功率消耗效率下的同时无线信息和能量传输（SWIPT）能力，提出了一种两层次联合优化方法，显著降低了系统功耗。

Result: 所提方法将系统功耗降低了60%（相比基准方案）和30%（相比优化功率分配方案），同时满足用户服务质量。

Conclusion: 该研究为XL-MIMO系统的节能设计提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了功率效率。

Abstract: This paper investigates the simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) capability of a modular extremely large multiple-input
multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system, in the context of power consumption (PC)
efficiency. The network users are divided into two functional categories:
information decoding (ID) users and energy harvesting (EH) users.
Non-stationary near-field channels are considered whilst the users are located
in spatially distinct visibility regions (VRs). We formulate a two-tier joint
optimization problem to minimize the PC, taking into account the power
allocation (PA) for ID and EH users, along with the activation of constituent
XL-MIMO subarrays. This complicated mixed-integer problem is transformed into
more tractable formulations and efficient algorithms are proposed for solving
them. The numerical results demonstrate that the overall PC of the XL-MIMO
system for the proposed method is reduced by more than 60% in comparison to the
benchmark scheme of equal PA with full subarray activation (SA) and 30% against
the case of optimized PA with full SA, while satisfying the quality-of-service
(QoS) constraints on both the downlink rate of the ID users and harvested
energy at the EH users.

### [5] [Near-Field Energy Harvesting Using XL-MIMO Over Non-Stationary Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20067)

Result: 所提算法的HPE性能接近最优，比基准方案提升120%，同时显著减少计算时间。

Conclusion: 该方法在XL-MIMO系统中高效提升了能量收集效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper explores the maximization of the harvested power efficiency (HPE)
in a modular extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system,
which supports energy harvesting (EH) for near-field users. These users are
located in spatially distinct visibility regions (VRs) with non-stationary
channel characteristics. We propose to determine which sub-arrays are switched
on or off as well the power control coefficients at the sub-arrays to maximize
the HPE. The design can be processed via a multi-tier joint optimization
framework based on fractional programming. The numerical results showcase that
the HPE performance of the proposed algorithm is nearly optimal, comparable to
that of exhaustive search. As a matter of fact, it achieves up to a 120% gain
over the benchmark scheme which uses the entire XL-MIMO array with equal power
allocation (PA) across sub-arrays, while significantly reducing the
computational time.

### [6] [Low-Complexity Ordered Reliability Direct Error Pattern Testing (ORDEPT) Decoding with Likelihood Thresholding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20079)
*Reza Hadavian,Dmitri Truhachev*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种降低复杂度的基于模式的软解码方法，通过提前终止准则减少延迟和计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码算法（如ORDEPT）虽然有效，但计算复杂度和延迟较高，需要优化。

Method: 基于ORDEPT算法，引入提前终止准则，通过预设阈值快速判断候选码字的可能性。

Result: 在保持相同块错误率（BLER）性能的同时，延迟和复杂度显著低于现有算法（如Chase II、ORBGRAND等）。

Conclusion: 新算法在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡，适用于需要低延迟和高效率的场景。

Abstract: We propose a reduced complexity approach to pattern-based soft decoding of
block codes. We start from the ORDEPT decoding algorithm which tests a list of
partial error patterns organized in the order of their likelihood and attempts
to complete the patterns creating candidate codewords. We then propose an early
termination criterion. Once a candidate codeword is found, its log-likelihood
difference to the received sequence is compared to a preset threshold and the
decoding decision is instantly made in case the likelihood deviation is below
the threshold. We demonstrate that while keeping the same block error rate
(BLER) performance, the proposed algorithm's latency and complexity is multiple
times smaller than that of the state-of-the art competitors including the Chase
II, ORBGRAND, GCD, and the very recent ORDEPT with Soft-Output GRAND
termination which necessitates several multiplications in each query
processing.

### [7] [Joint Quantization and Pruning Neural Networks Approach: A Case Study on FSO Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20084)
*Mohanad Obeed,Ming Jian*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种压缩感知学习方法，用于快速、硬件高效且低复杂度的自由空间光（FSO）接收器，通过联合量化、剪枝和训练卷积神经网络（CNN），并利用二幂权重替换乘法运算，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了设计快速、硬件高效且低复杂度的接收器，特别是在自由空间光通信中应对湍流干扰。

Method: 提出了一种压缩感知学习方法，联合量化、剪枝和训练CNN，并将权重设为二幂值以用位移操作替代乘法。

Result: 在1位和2位量化下，压缩后的CNN性能接近全精度CNN，且IM/DD FSO接收器在BER性能上优于依赖不完美CSI的ML接收器。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，适用于高效FSO接收器设计。

Abstract: Towards fast, hardware-efficient, and low-complexity receivers, we propose a
compression-aware learning approach and examine it on free-space optical (FSO)
receivers for turbulence mitigation. The learning approach jointly quantize,
prune, and train a convolutional neural network (CNN). In addition, we propose
to have the CNN weights of power of two values so we replace the multiplication
operations bit-shifting operations in every layer that has significant lower
computational cost. The compression idea in the proposed approach is that the
loss function is updated and both the quantization levels and the pruning
limits are optimized in every epoch of training. The compressed CNN is examined
for two levels of compression (1-bit and 2-bits) over different FSO systems.
The numerical results show that the compression approach provides negligible
decrease in performance in case of 1-bit quantization and the same performance
in case of 2-bits quantization, compared to the full-precision CNNs. In
general, the proposed IM/DD FSO receivers show better bit-error rate (BER)
performance (without the need for channel state information (CSI)) compared to
the maximum likelihood (ML) receivers that utilize imperfect CSI when the DL
model is compressed whether with 1-bit or 2-bit quantization.

### [8] [Sensing-Aware Transmit Waveform/Receive Filter Design for OFDM-MBS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20231)
*Xinghe Li,Kainan Cheng,Huiyong Li,Huiyong Li,Ziyang Cheng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究正交频分复用（OFDM）多基站（MBS）系统中的协作感知设计问题，提出一种联合设计OFDM序列和接收滤波器的方案，以降低旁瓣电平（SLL）并提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM波形的高旁瓣电平（SLL）会削弱雷达对弱目标的检测能力，而其他基站产生的互相关进一步恶化检测性能，因此需要优化设计。

Method: 提出一种基于交替优化（AO）的算法，联合设计OFDM序列和接收滤波器，最小化综合旁瓣电平（ISL），同时满足主瓣电平、峰均功率比（PAPR）和频谱分配约束。

Result: 数值模拟验证了所提方法的有效性，在多基站系统中显著优于匹配滤波方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的联合设计方案能有效降低旁瓣电平，提升雷达检测性能，适用于多基站系统。

Abstract: In this letter, we study the problem of cooperative sensing design for an
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple base stations (MBS)
system. We consider a practical scenario where the base stations (BSs) exploit
certain subcarriers to realize a sensing function. Since the high sidelobe
level (SLL) of OFDM waveforms degrades radar detection for weak targets, and
the cross-correlation generated by other BSs further exacerbates detection
performance, we devise a joint design scheme for OFDM sequence and receive
filter by minimizing the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) while satisfying
mainlobe level, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and spectrum allocation
constraints. To address this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating
optimization (AO)-based algorithm. Numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the superiority of SSL
reduction in the MBS system over the matched filtering method.

### [9] [Time and covariance smoothing for restoration of bivariate signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20237)
*Yusuf Yigit Pilavci,Pierre Palud,Julien Flamant,Pierre-Antoine Thouvenin,Jérémie Boulanger,Pierre Chainais*

Main category: eess.SP

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双变量信号的极化椭圆轨迹在解决逆问题时具有高信息量，但现有方法难以有效利用这一特性。

Method: 利用瞬时协方差矩阵表示极化信息，提出参数分裂策略，结合ADMM算法迭代求解。

Result: 在合成数据实验中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为双变量信号重建提供了一种高效且信息量丰富的解决方案。

Abstract: In many applications and physical phenomena, bivariate signals are polarized,
i.e. they trace an elliptical trajectory over time when viewed in the 2D planes
of their two components. The smooth evolution of this elliptical trajectory,
called polarization ellipse, is highly informative to solve ill-posed inverse
problems involving bivariate signals where the signal is collected through
indirect, noisy or incomplete measurements. This work proposes a novel
formulation and an efficient algorithm for reconstructing bivariate signals
with polarization regularization. The proposed formulation leverages the
compact representation of polarization through the instantaneous covariance
matrices. To address the resulting quartic optimization problem, we propose a
well-suited parameter splitting strategy which leads to an efficient iterative
algorithm (alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)) with convex
subproblems at each iteration. The performance of the proposed method is
illustrated on numerical synthetic data experiments.

### [10] [Superimposed DMRS for Spectrally Efficient 6G Uplink Multi-User OFDM: Classical vs AI/ML Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20248)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 5G系统使用正交DMRS进行信道估计，但开销大。6G提出叠加DMRS和数据符号的方法，本文提出基于CNN的DeepRx接收器，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G的正交DMRS虽然有效，但资源开销大，尤其在多用户和多层传输时。6G需要更高效的DMRS传输策略。

Method: 提出基于CNN的DeepRx接收器，用于从叠加DMRS符号中估计信道并检测数据；同时设计传统接收器作为对比。

Result: 在单用户和多用户场景下，DeepRx性能均优于传统接收器。

Conclusion: 叠加DMRS和数据符号的策略可行，DeepRx在6G系统中具有潜力。

Abstract: Fifth-generation (5G) systems utilize orthogonal demodulation reference
signals (DMRS) to enable channel estimation at the receiver. These orthogonal
DMRS-also referred to as pilots-are effective in avoiding pilot contamination
and interference from both the user's own data and that of others. However,
this approach incurs a significant overhead, as a substantial portion of the
time-frequency resources must be reserved for pilot transmission. Moreover, the
overhead increases with the number of users and transmission layers.
  To address these limitations in the context of emerging sixth-generation (6G)
systems and to support data transmission across the entire time-frequency grid,
the superposition of data and DMRS symbols has been explored as an alternative
DMRS transmission strategy. In this study, we propose an enhanced version of
DeepRx, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based receiver, capable of
estimating the channel from received superimposed (SI) DMRS symbols and
reliably detecting the transmitted data. We also design a conventional receiver
for comparison, which estimates the channel from SI DMRS using classical signal
processing techniques. Extensive evaluations in both uplink single-user and
multi-user scenarios demonstrate that DeepRx consistently outperforms the
conventional receivers in terms of performance.

### [11] [Analog OFDM based on Real-Time Fourier Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20287)
*Xiaolu Yang,Oscar Céspedes Vicente,Christophe Caloz*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于实时傅里叶变换（RTFT）的模拟正交频分复用（OFDM）架构，通过线性啁啾相位器实现频时映射，替代传统数字FFT/IFFT处理器。理论分析和仿真验证了其与传统数字OFDM系统的等效性，并展示了低功耗和抗多径衰落的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数字OFDM系统依赖FFT/IFFT处理器，功耗高且处理速度受限。本文旨在通过模拟技术实现OFDM，以降低功耗并提升处理速度。

Method: 采用线性啁啾相位器（具有工程化群速度色散）实现RTFT和频时映射，替代数字FFT/IFFT处理器。理论分析和仿真验证系统性能。

Result: 模拟OFDM系统在特定条件下与传统数字系统数学等效，仿真显示符号传输与恢复准确，且抗多径衰落。系统功耗低、处理速度快。

Conclusion: 该研究为全模拟或混合模拟-数字OFDM系统奠定了基础，有望应用于下一代高速、宽带、低功耗无线通信平台。

Abstract: This paper proposes an analog orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) architecture based on the real-time Fourier transform (RTFT). The core
enabling component is a linear-chirp phaser with engineered group velocity
dispersion (GVD), which realizes RTFT and performs frequency-to-time mapping in
the analog domain. In this architecture, conventional digital fast Fourier
transform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) processors are replaced by two
linear-chirp phasers with opposite group delay dispersions, respectively.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under specific phaser conditions, the
OFDM signal generated by the RTFT-based analog system is mathematically
equivalent to that of a conventional digital OFDM system. This equivalence is
further supported by simulation results, which confirm accurate symbol
transmission and recovery, as well as robustness to multipath fading when a
prefix is applied. Benefiting from the use of passive microwave components, the
analog OFDM system offers ultra-fast processing with reduced power consumption.
Overall, this work establishes a foundation for fully analog or hybrid
analog-digital OFDM system, offering a promising solution for next-generation
high-speed, wideband, and energy-efficient wireless communication platforms.

### [12] [OLALa: Online Learned Adaptive Lattice Codes for Heterogeneous Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20297)
*Natalie Lang,Maya Simhi,Nir Shlezinger*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OLALa的异构联邦学习框架，通过在线调整量化器优化通信效率和学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中固定量化规则在异构和动态环境中的不足。

Method: 提出OLALa框架，允许客户端通过轻量级本地计算在线调整量化器。

Result: 实验表明OLALa在各种量化率下均优于传统固定码本和非自适应方案。

Conclusion: OLALa通过动态调整量化器提升了联邦学习的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across distributed
clients without sharing raw data, often at the cost of substantial
communication overhead induced by transmitting high-dimensional model updates.
This overhead can be alleviated by having the clients quantize their model
updates, with dithered lattice quantizers identified as an attractive scheme
due to its structural simplicity and convergence-preserving properties.
However, existing lattice-based FL schemes typically rely on a fixed
quantization rule, which is suboptimal in heterogeneous and dynamic
environments where the model updates distribution varies across users and
training rounds. In this work, we propose Online Learned Adaptive Lattices
(OLALa), a heterogeneous FL framework where each client can adjust its
quantizer online using lightweight local computations. We first derive
convergence guarantees for FL with non-fixed lattice quantizers and show that
proper lattice adaptation can tighten the convergence bound. Then, we design an
online learning algorithm that enables clients to tune their quantizers
throughout the FL process while exchanging only a compact set of quantization
parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that OLALa consistently improves
learning performance under various quantization rates, outperforming
conventional fixed-codebook and non-adaptive schemes.

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代机载量子通信系统的设计、优化和部署提供了准确且易用的工具。

Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive analytical framework for modeling and
performance evaluation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-to-ground quantum
communication links, incorporating key physical impairments such as beam
divergence, pointing errors at both transmitter and receiver, atmospheric
attenuation, turbulence-induced fading, narrow field-of-view (FoV) filtering,
and background photon noise. To overcome the limitations of conventional
wide-beam assumptions, we introduce a grid-based approximation for photon
capture probability that remains accurate under tightly focused beams.
Analytical expressions are derived for the quantum key generation rate and
quantum bit error rate (QBER), enabling fast and reliable system-level
evaluation. Our results reveal that secure quantum key distribution (QKD) over
UAV-based free-space optical (FSO) links requires beam waists below 10 cm and
sub-milliradian tracking precision to achieve Mbps-level key rates and QBER
below $10^{-3}$. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of receiver FoV
in balancing background noise rejection and misalignment tolerance, and propose
adaptive FoV tuning strategies under varying illumination and alignment
conditions. The proposed framework provides a tractable and accurate tool for
the design, optimization, and deployment of next-generation airborne quantum
communication systems.

Abstract: In this letter, we study an active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)
assisted Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications under non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) scenarios, where the active RIS is deployed to create visual
line-of-sight links for reliable communication. To address the challenges of
high energy consumption caused by frequent beamforming updates in active RIS,
we propose a three-timescale optimization framework that jointly designs the
transmit beamforming, RIS beamforming, and RIS direction vectors based on their
characteristics. The goal is to maximize the system achievable rate while
reducing energy consumption by controlling the RIS beamforming switching
frequency. Then, a two-layer solution framework is developed, incorporating
fractional programming (FP), alternating optimization (AO), successive
approximation (SCA), and penalty-based methods, to obtain the optimized
solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can
effectively improve system performance and reduce the energy consumption of the
active RIS.

Abstract: This paper revisits the CHAMPAGNE algorithm within the Sparse Bayesian
Learning (SBL) framework and establishes its connection to reweighted sparse
coding. We demonstrate that the SBL objective can be reformulated as a
reweighted $\ell_{21}$-minimization problem, providing a more straightforward
interpretation of the sparsity mechanism and enabling the design of an
efficient iterative algorithm. Additionally, we analyze the behavior of this
reformulation in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, showing that it
simplifies to a weighted $\ell_{21}$-regularized least squares problem.
Numerical experiments validate the proposed approach, highlighting its improved
computational efficiency and ability to produce exact sparse solutions,
particularly in simulated MEG source localization tasks.

Abstract: Recent developments in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are laying the
groundwork for innovative applications across the healthcare sector.
Nanodevices designed to operate within the body, managed remotely via the
internet, are envisioned to promptly detect and actuate on potential diseases.
In this vision, an inherent challenge arises due to the limited capabilities of
individual nanosensors; specifically, nanosensors must communicate with one
another to collaborate as a cluster. Aiming to research the boundaries of the
clustering capabilities, this survey emphasizes data-driven communication
strategies in molecular communication (MC) channels as a means of linking
nanosensors. Relying on the flexibility and robustness of machine learning (ML)
methods to tackle the dynamic nature of MC channels, the MC research community
frequently refers to neural network (NN) architectures. This interdisciplinary
research field encompasses various aspects, including the use of NNs to
facilitate communication in MC environments, their implementation at the
nanoscale, explainable approaches for NNs, and dataset generation for training.
Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of fundamental
perspectives on recent trends in NN architectures for MC, the feasibility of
their implementation at the nanoscale, applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) techniques, and the accessibility of datasets along with
best practices for their generation. Additionally, we offer open-source code
repositories that illustrate NN-based methods to support reproducible research
for key MC scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging research challenges, such
as robust NN architectures, biologically integrated NN modules, and scalable
training strategies.

Abstract: The emergence of 6G wireless networks promises to revolutionize vehicular
communications by enabling ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-capacity data
exchange. In this context, collaborative perception techniques, where multiple
vehicles or infrastructure nodes cooperate to jointly receive and decode
transmitted signals, aim to enhance reliability and spectral efficiency for
Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) applications. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end wireless neural receiver based on a Differential Transformer
architecture, tailored for 6G V2X communication with a specific focus on
enabling collaborative perception among connected autonomous vehicles. Our
model integrates key components of the 6G physical layer, designed to boost
performance in dynamic and challenging autonomous driving environments. We
validate the proposed system across a range of scenarios, including
3GPP-defined Urban Macro (UMa) channel. To assess the model's real-world
applicability, we evaluate its robustness within a V2X framework. In a
collaborative perception scenario, our system processes heterogeneous LiDAR and
camera data from four connected vehicles in dynamic cooperative vehicular
networks. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving an average precision of 0.84, highlighting the potential of
our proposed approach to enable robust, intelligent, and adaptive wireless
cooperation for next-generation connected autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: In agriculture, molecular communication (MC) is envisioned as a framework to
address critical challenges such as smart pest control. While conventional
approaches mostly rely on synthetic plant protection products, posing high
risks for the environment, harnessing plant signaling processes can lead to
innovative approaches for nature-inspired sustainable pest control. In this
paper, we investigate an approach for sustainable pest control and reveal how
the MC paradigm can be employed for analysis and optimization. In particular,
we consider a system where herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs),
specifically methyl salicylate (MeSA), is encapsulated into microspheres
deployed on deployed on plant leaves. The controlled release of MeSA from the
microspheres, acting as transmitters (TXs), supports pest deterrence and
antagonist attraction, providing an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic plant
protection products. Based on experimental data, we investigate the MeSA
release kinetics and obtain an analytical model. To describe the propagation of
MeSA in farming environments, we employ a three dimensional (3D)
advection-diffusion model, incorporating realistic wind fields which are
predominantly affecting particle propagation, and solve it by a finite
difference method (FDM). The proposed model is used to investigate the MeSA
distribution for different TX arrangements, representing different practical
microsphere deployment strategies. Moreover, we introduce the coverage
effectiveness index (CEI) as a novel metric to quantify the environmental
coverage of MeSA. This analysis offers valuable guidance for the practical
development of microspheres and their deployment aimed at enhancing coverage
and, consequently, the attraction of antagonistic insects.

### [19] [Speaker Embeddings to Improve Tracking of Intermittent and Moving Speakers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19875)
*Taous Iatariene,Can Cui,Alexandre Guérin,Romain Serizel*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于说话人嵌入的身份重新分配方法，以解决间歇性和移动说话人场景中的跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统说话人跟踪方法依赖空间观测，但在说话人间歇移动时会导致轨迹不连续，因此需要一种更鲁棒的身份分配方法。

Method: 利用初始跟踪步骤提供的轨迹信息和多通道音频信号，通过波束成形增强信号并提取说话人嵌入，最后基于注册池重新分配身份。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在说话人移动场景中显著提升了身份分配性能，并研究了波束成形和输入时长对嵌入提取的影响。

Conclusion: 基于说话人嵌入的身份重新分配方法有效解决了间歇性和移动说话人跟踪问题，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Speaker tracking methods often rely on spatial observations to assign
coherent track identities over time. This raises limits in scenarios with
intermittent and moving speakers, i.e., speakers that may change position when
they are inactive, thus leading to discontinuous spatial trajectories. This
paper proposes to investigate the use of speaker embeddings, in a simple
solution to this issue. We propose to perform identity reassignment
post-tracking, using speaker embeddings. We leverage trajectory-related
information provided by an initial tracking step and multichannel audio signal.
Beamforming is used to enhance the signal towards the speakers' positions in
order to compute speaker embeddings. These are then used to assign new track
identities based on an enrollment pool. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed speaker embedding-based identity reassignment method on a dataset
where speakers change position during inactivity periods. Results show that it
consistently improves the identity assignment performance of neural and
standard tracking systems. In particular, we study the impact of beamforming
and input duration for embedding extraction.

Result: 在挑战中排名第四，Macro-F1为41.01%，平均CCC为0.5928，在效价预测中排名第二，CCC为0.6941。

Conclusion: MATER框架有效捕捉了语音中的情感细节，并通过不确定性感知提升了鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents our contributions to the Speech Emotion Recognition in
Naturalistic Conditions (SERNC) Challenge, where we address categorical emotion
recognition and emotional attribute prediction. To handle the complexities of
natural speech, including intra- and inter-subject variability, we propose
Multi-level Acoustic-Textual Emotion Representation (MATER), a novel
hierarchical framework that integrates acoustic and textual features at the
word, utterance, and embedding levels. By fusing low-level lexical and acoustic
cues with high-level contextualized representations, MATER effectively captures
both fine-grained prosodic variations and semantic nuances. Additionally, we
introduce an uncertainty-aware ensemble strategy to mitigate annotator
inconsistencies, improving robustness in ambiguous emotional expressions. MATER
ranks fourth in both tasks with a Macro-F1 of 41.01% and an average CCC of
0.5928, securing second place in valence prediction with an impressive CCC of
0.6941.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TI-DANSE+的算法，用于提升无线声学传感器网络中拓扑无关分布式自适应节点特定信号估计的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TI-DANSE算法在非全连接网络中收敛速度慢，限制了其应用。

Method: TI-DANSE+允许节点利用邻居传输的局部信息，增加自由度，并结合树剪枝策略加速收敛。

Result: TI-DANSE+在全连接网络中收敛速度与DANSE相当，同时降低了传输功耗。

Conclusion: TI-DANSE+显著提升了收敛速度，并通过数值模拟验证了其性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of topology-independent (TI) distributed
adaptive node-specific signal estimation (DANSE) in wireless acoustic sensor
networks (WASNs) where sensor nodes exchange only fused versions of their local
signals. An algorithm named TI-DANSE has previously been presented to handle
non-fully connected WASNs. However, its slow iterative convergence towards the
optimal solution limits its applicability. To address this, we propose in this
paper the TI-DANSE+ algorithm. At each iteration in TI-DANSE+, the node set to
update its local parameters is allowed to exploit each individual partial
in-network sums transmitted by its neighbors in its local estimation problem,
increasing the available degrees of freedom and accelerating convergence with
respect to TI-DANSE. Additionally, a tree-pruning strategy is proposed to
further increase convergence speed. TI-DANSE+ converges as fast as the DANSE
algorithm in fully connected WASNs while reducing transmit power usage. The
convergence properties of TI-DANSE+ are demonstrated in numerical simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索说话人识别嵌入在零样本TTS中的有效性，填补研究空白。

Method: 使用YourTTS系统比较H/ASP、x-vector和ECAPA-TDNN三种编码器，通过主观和客观方法评估。

Result: H/ASP编码器表现最佳，ECAPA-TDNN优于x-vector，但未超越H/ASP。

Conclusion: 说话人识别嵌入在TTS中的表现需实证评估，研究为未来比较提供了框架。

Abstract: Zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) systems rely on speaker
embeddings to synthesize speech in the voice of an unseen speaker, using only a
short reference utterance. While many speaker embeddings have been developed
for speaker recognition, their relative effectiveness in zero-shot TTS remains
underexplored. In this work, we employ a YourTTS-based TTS system to compare
three different speaker encoders - YourTTS's original H/ASP encoder, x-vector
embeddings, and ECAPA-TDNN embeddings - within an otherwise fixed zero-shot TTS
framework. All models were trained on the same dataset of Czech read speech and
evaluated on 24 out-of-domain target speakers using both subjective and
objective methods. The subjective evaluation was conducted via a listening test
focused on speaker similarity, while the objective evaluation measured cosine
distances between speaker embeddings extracted from synthesized and real
utterances. Across both evaluations, the original H/ASP encoder consistently
outperformed the alternatives, with ECAPA-TDNN showing better results than
x-vectors. These findings suggest that, despite the popularity of ECAPA-TDNN in
speaker recognition, it does not necessarily offer improvements for speaker
similarity in zero-shot TTS in this configuration. Our study highlights the
importance of empirical evaluation when reusing speaker recognition embeddings
in TTS and provides a framework for additional future comparisons.

Method: 结合说话人无关模型和说话人条件模型，使用FiLM技术嵌入说话人特征，通过合成数据训练。

Result: 在捷克电视辩论数据集上，重叠段WER从68.0%降至35.78%，计算负载仅增加44%。

Conclusion: 该方法为连续ASR服务中的重叠语音转录提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Overlapping speech remains a major challenge for automatic speech recognition
(ASR) in real-world applications, particularly in broadcast media with dynamic,
multi-speaker interactions. We propose a light-weight, target-speaker-based
extension to an existing streaming ASR system to enable practical transcription
of overlapping speech with minimal computational overhead. Our approach
combines a speaker-independent (SI) model for standard operation with a
speaker-conditioned (SC) model selectively applied in overlapping scenarios.
Overlap detection is achieved using a compact binary classifier trained on
frozen SI model output, offering accurate segmentation at negligible cost. The
SC model employs Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to incorporate speaker
embeddings and is trained on synthetically mixed data to transcribe only the
target speaker. Our method supports dynamic speaker tracking and reuses
existing modules with minimal modifications. Evaluated on a challenging set of
Czech television debates with 16% overlap, the system reduced WER on
overlapping segments from 68.0% (baseline) to 35.78% while increasing total
computational load by only 44%. The proposed system offers an effective and
scalable solution for overlap transcription in continuous ASR services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督学习模型是否能模拟人类多模态语音感知中的音频与视觉线索异步性。

Method: 比较AV-HuBERT与音频-only HuBERT模型，通过线性分类器追踪其语音解码能力的时间变化。

Result: AV-HuBERT的语音信息解码仅比HuBERT提前约20毫秒，未能充分捕捉多模态感知的时间动态。

Conclusion: AV-HuBERT不适合模拟多模态语音感知过程，因其未能充分捕捉时间动态。

Abstract: Human speech perception is multimodal. In natural speech, lip movements can
precede corresponding voicing by a non-negligible gap of 100-300 ms, especially
for specific consonants, affecting the time course of neural phonetic encoding
in human listeners. However, it remains unexplored whether self-supervised
learning models, which have been used to simulate audio-visual integration in
humans, can capture this asynchronicity between audio and visual cues. We
compared AV-HuBERT, an audio-visual model, with audio-only HuBERT, by using
linear classifiers to track their phonetic decodability over time. We found
that phoneme information becomes available in AV-HuBERT embeddings only about
20 ms before HuBERT, likely due to AV-HuBERT's lower temporal resolution and
feature concatenation process. It suggests AV-HuBERT does not adequately
capture the temporal dynamics of multimodal speech perception, limiting its
suitability for modeling the multimodal speech perception process.

Motivation: 枪击事件频发威胁公共安全，现有商业系统成本高昂，需低成本替代方案。

Method: 利用枪声录音的声学特征，提出SVM和CNN框架进行枪声检测与枪支分类。

Result: CNN在干净数据上mAP达0.58，优于SVM的0.39；但在噪声数据上表现下降（mAP 0.35）。

Abstract: The escalating rates of gun-related violence and mass shootings represent a
significant threat to public safety. Timely and accurate information for law
enforcement agencies is crucial in mitigating these incidents. Current
commercial gunshot detection systems, while effective, often come with
prohibitive costs. This research explores a cost-effective alternative by
leveraging acoustic analysis of gunshot recordings, potentially obtainable from
ubiquitous devices like cell phones, to not only detect gunshots but also
classify the type of firearm used. This paper details a study on deciphering
gun type hierarchies using a curated dataset of 3459 recordings. We investigate
the fundamental acoustic characteristics of gunshots, including muzzle blasts
and shockwaves, which vary based on firearm type, ammunition, and shooting
direction. We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type
classification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a
mean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the
SVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental
noise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data
(mAP 0.35) are also discussed. The long-term vision is to develop a highly
accurate, real-time system deployable on common recording devices,
significantly reducing detection costs and providing critical intelligence to
first responders.

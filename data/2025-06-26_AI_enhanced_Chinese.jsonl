This work proposes a novel\nformulation and an efficient algorithm for reconstructing bivariate signals\nwith polarization regularization. The proposed formulation leverages the\ncompact representation of polarization through the instantaneous covariance\nmatrices. To address the resulting quartic optimization problem, we propose a\nwell-suited parameter splitting strategy which leads to an efficient iterative\nalgorithm (alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)) with convex\nsubproblems at each iteration. The performance of the proposed method is\nillustrated on numerical synthetic data experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6781\u5316\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77ac\u65f6\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\u6781\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528ADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6781\u5316\u692d\u5706\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u77ac\u65f6\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u6781\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u88c2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address the challenges of\nhigh energy consumption caused by frequent beamforming updates in active RIS,\nwe propose a three-timescale optimization framework that jointly designs the\ntransmit beamforming, RIS beamforming, and RIS direction vectors based on their\ncharacteristics. The goal is to maximize the system achievable rate while\nreducing energy consumption by controlling the RIS beamforming switching\nfrequency. Then, a two-layer solution framework is developed, incorporating\nfractional programming (FP), alternating optimization (AO), successive\napproximation (SCA), and penalty-based methods, to obtain the optimized\nsolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can\neffectively improve system performance and reduce the energy consumption of the\nactive RIS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08RIS\uff09\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e3b\u52a8RIS\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d1\u5c04\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001RIS\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548cRIS\u65b9\u5411\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u9010\u6b21\u903c\u8fd1\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e3b\u52a8RIS\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While conventional\napproaches mostly rely on synthetic plant protection products, posing high\nrisks for the environment, harnessing plant signaling processes can lead to\ninnovative approaches for nature-inspired sustainable pest control. In this\npaper, we investigate an approach for sustainable pest control and reveal how\nthe MC paradigm can be employed for analysis and optimization. In particular,\nwe consider a system where herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs),\nspecifically methyl salicylate (MeSA), is encapsulated into microspheres\ndeployed on deployed on plant leaves. The controlled release of MeSA from the\nmicrospheres, acting as transmitters (TXs), supports pest deterrence and\nantagonist attraction, providing an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic plant\nprotection products. Based on experimental data, we investigate the MeSA\nrelease kinetics and obtain an analytical model. To describe the propagation of\nMeSA in farming environments, we employ a three dimensional (3D)\nadvection-diffusion model, incorporating realistic wind fields which are\npredominantly affecting particle propagation, and solve it by a finite\ndifference method (FDM). The proposed model is used to investigate the MeSA\ndistribution for different TX arrangements, representing different practical\nmicrosphere deployment strategies. Moreover, we introduce the coverage\neffectiveness index (CEI) as a novel metric to quantify the environmental\ncoverage of MeSA. This analysis offers valuable guidance for the practical\ndevelopment of microspheres and their deployment aimed at enhancing coverage\nand, consequently, the attraction of antagonistic insects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\uff08MC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5bb3\u866b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c01\u88c5\u690d\u7269\u6325\u53d1\u7269\uff08MeSA\uff09\u7684\u5fae\u7403\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u519c\u4e1a\u5bb3\u866b\u63a7\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u519c\u836f\uff0c\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u690d\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u73af\u4fdd\u7684\u5bb3\u866b\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u7403\u5c01\u88c5MeSA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u91ca\u653e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u98ce\u573a\u4f18\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdMeSA\u91ca\u653e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u6548\u679c\u6307\u6570\uff08CEI\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u7403\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5bb3\u866b\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5fae\u7403\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8MeSA\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5bb3\u866b\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which\nallocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However,\nspeech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result,\nmany tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences.\nTo address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for\ncompressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on\nneural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and\narchitecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and\nMelt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When\nintegrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR\n($\\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to\n46% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and\nsimilar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also\nenables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a\nsingle model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently\noutperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates.

In this\npaper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter\nconfigurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:\nHindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.\n  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in\ncapturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short\nmelodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range\ndependencies crucial for structured improvisation.

In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a\nconditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural\nsinging voices.

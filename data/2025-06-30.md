### [1] [When Every Symbol Counts: Resilient Wireless Systems Under Finite Blocklength Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21664)
*Kevin Weinberger,Aydin Sezgin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究6G网络中有限块长（FBL）约束对恢复性能的影响，并利用可重构智能表面（RIS）提升恢复能力，发现两个关键块长阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需要高韧性以应对动态环境和突发中断，但FBL约束下的短包和纠错开销会降低通信效率，影响恢复效果。

Method: 在韧性框架中研究FBL约束，引入RIS以增强适应性，通过数值分析确定关键块长阈值。

Result: 发现两个关键块长阈值：一个可完全抵消FBL损失，另一个还能恢复初始中断，显著提升韧性。RIS数量可调整阈值。

Conclusion: RIS能有效缓解FBL约束下的性能损失，为速率、块长和重构努力的权衡提供新见解。

Abstract: As 6G evolves, wireless networks become essential for critical operations and
enable innovative applications that demand seamless adaptation to dynamic
environments and disruptions. Because these vital services require
uninterrupted operation, their resilience to unforeseen disruptions is
essential. However, implementing resilience necessitates rapid recovery
procedures, which operate in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, where short
packets and added error-correction overhead can severely degrade communication
efficiency. Due to this performance loss, always attempting recovery can
backfire and result in worse outcomes than simply enduring the disruption under
longer blocklengths. In this work, we study these effects of FBL constraints
within a resilience framework, incorporating reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) to enhance adaptation capabilities. By actively shaping the
wireless environment, RIS help counteract some of the performance losses caused
by FBL, enabling more effective recovery from disruptions. Numerical results
reveal two critical blocklength thresholds: the first enables full recovery
from the FBL penalty, while the second, at a higher blocklength, allows the
system to recover from both the FBL penalty and the initial disruption,
yielding a significant improvement in resilience performance. Additionally, we
show that the number of RIS elements shifts these thresholds, enabling faster
reconfiguration with shorter blocklengths and providing insights to the
trade-offs between rate, blocklength, and reconfiguration effort under FBL
conditions.

### [2] [Joint RIS-UE Association and Beamforming Design in RIS-Assisted Cell-Free MIMO Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21690)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过RIS-UE关联减少信道获取开销的方法，并设计了两阶段框架优化加权和速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RIS辅助CF MIMO网络中大量RIS元素部署带来的高信道获取开销问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用多对多匹配算法建立RIS-UE关联；第二阶段通过顺序优化方法分别优化RIS相位和AP波束成形。

Result: 仿真表明算法有效，RIS-UE关联显著减少开销，性能损失在可接受范围内。RIS部署位置建议在AP和UE之间。

Conclusion: RIS-UE关联是降低开销的有效方法，且RIS部署位置对性能有显著影响。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted cell-free (CF)
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks can significantly enhance system
performance. However, the extensive deployment of RIS elements imposes
considerable channel acquisition overhead, with the high density of nodes and
antennas in RIS-assisted CF networks amplifying this challenge. To tackle this
issue, in this paper, we explore integrating RIS-user equipment (UE)
association into downlink RIS-assisted CF transmitter design, which greatly
reduces the channel acquisition costs. The key point is that once UEs are
associated with specific RISs, there is no need to frequently acquire channels
from non-associated RISs. Then, we formulate the problem of joint RIS-UE
association and beamforming at APs and RISs to maximize the weighted sum rate
(WSR). In particular, we propose a two-stage framework to solve it. In the
first stage, we apply a many-to-many matching algorithm to establish the RIS-UE
association. In the second stage, we introduce a sequential optimization-based
method that decomposes the joint optimization of RIS phase shifts and AP
beamforming into two distinct subproblems. To optimize the RIS phase shifts, we
employ the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to obtain a
semi-closed-form solution. For AP beamforming, we develop a joint block
diagonalization algorithm, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that,
while RIS-UE association significantly reduces overhead, it incurs a minor
performance loss that remains within an acceptable range. Additionally, we
investigate the impact of RIS deployment and conclude that RISs exhibit
enhanced performance when positioned between APs and UEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度神经网络在雷达目标检测中表现优异，但高计算复杂度限制了其在嵌入式雷达系统中的广泛应用。

Result: 在雷达信号测试中，提出的新网络在满足检测概率要求的同时，显著降低了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法成功设计出轻量化且高性能的神经网络，为嵌入式雷达系统的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent research works establish deep neural networks as high performing tools
for radar target detection, especially on challenging environments (presence of
clutter or interferences, multi-target scenarii...). However, the usually large
computational complexity of these networks is one of the factors preventing
them from being widely implemented in embedded radar systems. We propose to
investigate novel neural architecture search (NAS) methods, based on
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), for finding neural networks achieving the
required detection performance and striving towards a lower computational
complexity. We evaluate the searched architectures on endoclutter radar
signals, in order to compare their respective performance metrics and
generalization properties. A novel network satisfying the required detection
probability while being significantly lighter than the expert-designed baseline
is proposed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ML在无线网络中的应用多为仿真研究，缺乏实际场景中ML模型互不共享的验证，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了一种保密训练互操作ML模型的方法，并在原型UE和基站上测试了模型的准确性。

Result: 测量结果表明，无需共享ML模型即可实现高精度的信道反馈，并提升下行链路吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该方法为6G网络中ML信道反馈的实际应用提供了可行性证明。

Abstract: Neural network-based compression and decompression of channel state feedback
has been one of the most widely studied applications of machine learning (ML)
in wireless networks. Various simulation-based studies have shown that ML-based
feedback compression can result in reduced overhead and more accurate channel
information. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no real-life
proofs of concepts demonstrating the benefits of ML-based channel feedback
compression in a practical setting, where the user equipment (UE) and base
station have no access to each others' ML models. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for training interoperable compression and decompression ML
models in a confidential manner, and demonstrate the accuracy of the ensuing
models using prototype UEs and base stations. The performance of the ML-based
channel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed
channel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the
channel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results
demonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel
feedback link without having to share ML models between device and network
vendors. These results pave the way for a practical implementation of ML-based
channel feedback in commercial 6G networks.

### [5] [Adaptive Multipath-Based SLAM for Distributed MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21798)
*Xuhong Li,Benjamin J. B. Deutschmann,Erik Leitinger,Florian Meyer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯的多路径同时定位与建图（MP-SLAM）方法，用于分布式MIMO系统，解决了非凸几何环境中路径信息融合的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MP-SLAM方法假设地图特征和RF传播路径统计独立，忽略了单反射面对多条路径或多基站通信时的依赖关系，且无法在非凸几何环境中进行射线追踪。

Method: 使用振幅统计建立自适应时变检测概率，提出“软”射线追踪策略，结合因子图和和积算法（SPA）进行贝叶斯估计，并改进粒子计算的提议PDF以支持双跳路径的新表面检测。

Result: 在非凸几何环境的合成RF测量中验证了方法的有效性，能够提供准确的定位和建图估计，并达到后验CRLB。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了非凸几何环境中的路径信息融合问题，为可靠通信、定位感知安全和关键导航等应用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Localizing users and mapping the environment using radio signals is a key
task in emerging applications such as reliable communications, location-aware
security, and safety critical navigation. Recently introduced multipath-based
simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) can jointly localize a mobile
agent and the reflective surfaces in radio frequency (RF) environments. Most
existing MP-SLAM methods assume that map features and their corresponding RF
propagation paths are statistically independent, which neglects inherent
dependencies arising when a single reflective surface contributes to different
propagation paths or when an agent communicates with more than one base
station. Previous approaches that aim to fuse information across propagation
paths are limited by their inability to perform ray tracing in environments
with nonconvex geometries. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian MP-SLAM method
for distributed MIMO systems that addresses this limitation. In particular, we
use amplitude statistics to establish adaptive time-varying detection
probabilities. Based on the resulting "soft" ray-tracing strategy, our method
can fuse information across propagation paths in RF environments with nonconvex
geometries. A Bayesian estimation method for the joint estimation of map
features and agent position is established by applying the message passing
rules of the sum-product algorithm (SPA) to the factor graph that represents
the proposed statistical model. We also introduce an improved proposal PDF for
particle-based computation of SPA messages. This proposal PDF enables the early
detection of new surfaces that are solely supported by double-bounce paths. Our
method is validated using synthetic RF measurements in a challenging scenario
with nonconvex geometries. The results demonstrate that it can provide accurate
localization and mapping estimates as well as attain the posterior CRLB.

### [6] [From Token to Rhythm: A Multi-Scale Approach for ECG-Language Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21803)
*Fuying Wang,Jiacheng Xu,Lequan Yu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: MELP是一种新型的多尺度ECG-语言预训练模型，通过分层监督从ECG-文本对中提取信息，显著优于现有自监督学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ECG分析依赖大规模人工标注，耗时耗力；自监督学习虽为替代方案，但现有方法未能捕捉ECG信号的多尺度特性。

Method: MELP结合心脏学专用语言模型和三层次跨模态监督（token、节拍、节律），对齐ECG信号与文本报告。

Result: 在多个ECG数据集和任务（如零样本分类、线性探测、迁移学习）中，MELP表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MELP通过多尺度监督有效捕捉ECG信号的层次结构，为临床ECG分析提供了高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in monitoring cardiac health and
diagnosing heart diseases. However, traditional deep learning approaches for
ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both
time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation,
self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling
the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently
transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored
SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail
to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods
struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model
the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP,
a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages
hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a
cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical
text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token,
beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing
structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three
public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG
classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its
effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications. Our code
is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/MELP.

### [7] [Improving Convergence for Semi-Federated Learning: An Energy-Efficient Approach by Manipulating Over-the-Air Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21893)
*Jingheng Zheng,Hui Tian,Wanli Ni,Yang Tian,Ping Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合联邦学习和分割学习的混合框架SemiFL，利用空中计算进行梯度聚合，通过调整学习率优化收敛性和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习和分割学习在收敛性和能耗方面的局限性，提出一种更高效的混合框架。

Method: 通过操纵空中计算的失真来调整学习率，分为非稳定区和稳定区分别优化，提出两种资源分配算法。

Result: 理论分析和仿真表明，该方法在不同数据分布和网络条件下能有效加速收敛并降低能耗。

Conclusion: SemiFL框架通过优化学习率和资源分配，显著提升了收敛效率和能耗表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid learning framework that combines federated
and split learning, termed semi-federated learning (SemiFL), in which
over-the-air computation is utilized for gradient aggregation. A key idea is to
strategically adjust the learning rate by manipulating over-the-air distortion
for improving SemiFL's convergence. Specifically, we intentionally amplify
amplitude distortion to increase the learning rate in the non-stable region,
thereby accelerating convergence and reducing communication energy consumption.
In the stable region, we suppress noise perturbation to maintain a small
learning rate for improving SemiFL's final convergence. Theoretical results
demonstrate the antagonistic effects of over-the-air distortion in different
regions, under both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and
non-i.i.d. data settings. Then, we formulate two energy consumption
minimization problems, one for each region, which implements a two-region mean
square error threshold configuration scheme. Accordingly, we propose two
resource allocation algorithms with closed-form solutions. Simulation results
show that under different network and data distribution conditions,
strategically manipulating over-the-air distortion can efficiently adjust the
learning rate to improve SemiFL's convergence. Moreover, energy consumption can
be reduced by using the proposed algorithms.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于半定规划引导粒子群优化（SgPSO）的算法，用于优化可移动天线（MAs）的配置，以最小化无线能量传输中的功耗，并显著优于固定天线阵列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可移动天线（MAs）技术为6G及以后的无线系统提供了新的机会，特别是在无线能量传输中，通过动态调整天线位置可以提高能效和可扩展性。

Method: 提出了一种半定规划引导粒子群优化（SgPSO）算法，用于优化天线配置和功率分配，解决了非线性非凸优化问题。

Result: SgPSO算法在配置可移动天线时显著优于固定天线阵列，尤其是在天线或设备数量较多时。均匀分布的可移动天线性能接近独立控制的天线，但随着设备数量增加，差距会扩大。

Conclusion: 研究展示了可移动天线在无线能量传输中的潜力，并验证了SgPSO算法的有效性，同时探讨了天线数量增加对近场条件的影响。

Abstract: Recent advancements in movable antennas (MAs) technology create new
opportunities for 6G and beyond wireless systems. MAs are promising for radio
frequency wireless energy transfer because they can dynamically adjust antenna
positions, improving energy efficiency and scalability. This work aims to
minimize the power consumed by an analog beamforming power beacon equipped with
independently-controlled MAs (IMAs) for charging multiple single-antenna
devices. To this end, we enforce a minimum separation among antennas and a
minimum received power at the devices. The resulting optimization problem is
nonlinear and nonconvex due to interdependencies among the variables. To tackle
this, we propose a semidefinite program guided particle swarm optimization
(SgPSO) algorithm where each particle represents an antenna configuration, and
the fitness function optimizes the corresponding power allocation. SgPSO is
utilized for configuring the MAs largely outperforming fixed array
implementations, particularly with more antennas or devices. We also present an
alternative implementation using uniformly-spaced MAs, whose performance
closely approaches that of the IMAs, with the gap widening only as the number
of devices grows. We also examine how increasing the number of antennas
promotes near-field conditions, which decrease as devices become more widely
distributed.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer和GNN的混合神经接收器（H-NR），用于端到端无线通信框架，性能优于现有方法约0.5 dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经接收器模型未能全面替代物理层功能块，需开发更全面的解决方案。

Method: 结合Transformer编码器和GNN构建H-NR，覆盖OFDM资源网格解映射、信道估计、信号均衡、解调和解码。

Result: 在多种场景（车速0-60 km/h、5.9GHz载频、CDL信道）和模态数据（图像、音频等）下表现优异。

Conclusion: H-NR在重建和纠错方面优于现有技术，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Neural receiver models are proposed to jointly optimize multiple
functionalities of wireless receivers; however, a comprehensive receiver model
that replaces the entire physical layer blocks has not yet been presented in
the literature. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid neural receiver
(H-NR) built on Transformer encoder blocks and Graph Neural Network (GNN), as
part of an end-to-end wireless communication framework. In our communication
framework, we assume vehicle to network (V2N) uplink scenario where information
is transmitted by vehicle and received at the base station (BS). Our proposed
H-NR model replace OFDM resource grid demapping, channel estimation, signal
equalization, demodulation, and channel decoding. To test the adaptability of
our proposed model on unseen conditions, we evaluate its performance for
various scenarios, including a vehicle speed of range [0-60] km/h, a carrier
frequency of 5.9GHz, and a cluster delay line (CDL) channel model. Furthermore,
we assess the performance of our proposed H-NR on multimodal data, such as
images, audio, GPS, radar, and LiDAR, to examine its adaptability in real-world
use cases. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that our proposed model
outperforms the state-of-the-art neural receiver by approximately 0.5 dB in
terms of reconstruction and error correction.

### [10] [Hybrid Constellation Modulation for Symbol-Level Precoding in RIS-Enhanced MU-MISO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22059)
*Yupeng Zheng,Yi Ma,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型调制方案HCM和两阶段优化方法，解决了RIS增强MU-MISO系统中SLP的可扩展性和CI区域限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SLP在RIS增强MU-MISO系统中的可扩展性问题以及QAM在CI利用中的局限性。

Method: 提出HCM调制方案（结合QAM和ASK子星座）和两阶段反射与SLP优化方法。

Result: HCM在16和64阶调制下分别比QAM获得1.5 dB和1 dB的SER增益。

Conclusion: HCM和两阶段优化方法有效提升了系统性能，适用于实际RIS系统。

Abstract: The application of symbol-level precoding (SLP) in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) enhanced multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO)
systems faces two main challenges. First, the state-of-the-art joint reflecting
and SLP optimization approach requires exhaustive enumeration of all possible
transmit symbol combinations, resulting in scalability issues as the modulation
order and number of users increase. Second, conventional quadrature amplitude
modulation (QAM) exhibits strict constructive interference (CI) regions,
limiting its effectiveness for CI exploitation in SLP. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel modulation scheme, termed
hybrid-constellation modulation (HCM), which has a structure of superposed QAM
and ASK sub-constellations (SCs). HCM extends the CI regions compared to QAM.
Additionally, a two-stage reflecting and SLP optimization method is developed
to support HCM. The proposed methods are designed for practical RIS with
discrete phase shifts and has good scalability. Simulation results show that
HCM achieves up to 1.5 dB and 1 dB SER gains over QAM with modulation order 16
and 64, respectively.

TL;DR: 6G网络中，RIS技术通过智能反射电磁波提升物理层安全性，实验验证了RIS在室内多路径环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需支持更快速、安全的IoT应用，物理层安全（PLS）是关键，而RIS技术能有效增强PLS。

Result: 实验表明RIS能提升合法用户的数据速率并增强保密性，同时揭示了RIS的频率选择性。

Conclusion: RIS技术在实际环境中优化物理层安全具有潜力，为未来6G网络提供了实用参考。

Abstract: Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks aim to support innovative
Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications that demand faster and more secure data
transmission. While higher Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers employ
measures like encryption and secure protocols to address data security,
Physical-Layer Security (PLS) focuses on preventing information leakage to
EavesDroppers (EDs) and mitigating the effects of jammers and spoofing attacks.
In this context, the emerging technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
(RISs) can play an instrumental role, enhancing PLS by intelligently reflecting
electromagnetic waves to benefit Legitimate Users (LUs) while obstructing EDs.
This paper presents practical indoor measurements to evaluate the capability of
an RIS to enhance PLS, focusing on a varactor-based RIS technology designed for
the FR1 band at 3.55 GHz. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art RIS-aided
secrecy optimization algorithms together with a novel approach designed in this
paper, which relies on a newly generated RIS phase configuration codebook,
highlight the potential of RISs to improve both data rates for LUs as well as
secrecy against EDs in real-world indoor multipath environments. The results
also demonstrate the frequency selectivity of the RIS, proviging practical
insights on the optimization of the technology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在移动性和硬件损伤下实现相干信号叠加的可行性，以支持相干空中计算（OAC）等应用。

Method: 引入相位编码导频（PCPs）策略，通过消除上下行链路的往返相位变化来对齐接收符号的相位。

Result: 残余载波频率偏移（CFO）是影响相位相干持续时间的主要因素，移动性和节点数量也有显著影响。

Conclusion: PCPs在实际中可行，为相干信号叠加提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we analyze the feasibility of distributed phase
synchronization for coherent signal superposition, a fundamental enabler for
paradigms such as coherent over-the-air computation (OAC), distributed
beamforming, and interference alignment, under mobility and hardware
impairments. With the focus on coherent OAC, we introduce phase-coded pilots
(PCPs), a strategy where the radios communicate with each other to eliminate
the round-trip phase change in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) to align the
phase of the received symbol at a desired angle. In this study, considering a
carrier frequency offset (CFO)-resilient multi-user procedure, we derive the
statistics of the phase deviations to assess how fast the phase coherency
degrades. Our results show that residual CFO is a major factor determining the
duration of phase coherency, in addition to the non-negligible effects of
mobility and the number of nodes in the network. We also provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration for coherent signal superposition by using
off-the-shelf radios to demonstrate the feasibility of PCPs in practice.

Abstract: Robust regression models in the presence of outliers have significant
practical relevance in areas such as signal processing, financial econometrics,
and energy management. Many existing robust regression methods, either grounded
in statistical theory or sparse signal recovery, typically rely on the explicit
or implicit assumption of outlier sparsity to filter anomalies and recover the
underlying signal or data. However, these methods often suffer from limited
robustness or high computational complexity, rendering them inefficient for
large-scale problems. In this work, we propose a novel robust regression model
based on a Self-scaled Approximate l0 Regularization Model (SARM) scheme. By
introducing a self-scaling mechanism into the regularization term, the proposed
model mitigates the negative impact of uneven or excessively large outlier
magnitudes on robustness. We also develop an alternating minimization algorithm
grounded in Proximal Operators and Block Coordinate Descent. We rigorously
prove the algorithm convergence. Empirical comparisons with several
state-of-the-art robust regression methods demonstrate that SARM not only
achieves superior robustness but also significantly improves computational
efficiency. Motivated by both the theoretical error bound and empirical
observations, we further design a Two-Stage SARM (TSSARM) framework, which
better utilizes sample information when the singular values of the design
matrix are widely spread, thereby enhancing robustness under certain
conditions. Finally, we validate our approach on a real-world load forecasting
task. The experimental results show that our method substantially enhances the
robustness of load forecasting against adversarial data attacks, which is
increasingly critical in the era of heightened data security concerns.

Abstract: Acoustic filters are preferred front-end solutions at sub-6 GHz due to their
superior frequency selectivity compared to electromagnetic (EM) counterparts.
With the ongoing development of 5G and the evolution toward 6G, there is a
growing need to extend acoustic filter technologies into frequency range 3
(FR3), which spans 7 to 24 GHz to accommodate emerging high-frequency bands.
However, scaling acoustic filters beyond 10 GHz presents significant
challenges, as conventional platforms suffer from increased insertion loss (IL)
and degraded out-of-band (OoB) rejection at higher frequencies. Recent
innovations have led to the emergence of periodically poled piezoelectric
lithium niobate (P3F LN) laterally excited bulk acoustic resonators (XBARs),
offering low-loss and high electromechanical coupling performance above 10 GHz.
This work presents the first tri-layer P3F LN filter operating at 19.3 GHz,
achieving a low IL of 2.2 dB, a 3-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 8.5%, and an
impressive 49 dB close in rejection. These results demonstrate strong potential
for integration into FR3 diplexers.

TL;DR: HighRateMOS是首个显式考虑采样率的非侵入式语音质量评分模型，通过结合多种特征，在AudioMOS 2025 Track3中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音质量预测模型在测试时面对高采样率音频可能产生偏差，需要更鲁棒的模型。

Method: HighRateMOS集成三种模型变体，利用采样率嵌入、Wav2vec 2.0自监督嵌入、多尺度CNN频谱特征和MFCC特征。

Result: 在AudioMOS 2025 Track3中，HighRateMOS在八项指标中的五项排名第一。

Conclusion: 直接建模采样率能实现更鲁棒且与采样率无关的语音质量预测。

Abstract: Modern speech quality prediction models are trained on audio data resampled
to a specific sampling rate. When faced with higher-rate audio at test time,
these models can produce biased scores. We introduce HighRateMOS, the first
non-intrusive mean opinion score (MOS) model that explicitly considers sampling
rate. HighRateMOS ensembles three model variants that exploit the following
information: (i) a learnable embedding of speech sampling rate, (ii) Wav2vec
2.0 self-supervised embeddings, (iii) multi-scale CNN spectral features, and
(iv) MFCC features. In AudioMOS 2025 Track3, HighRateMOS ranked first in five
out of eight metrics. Our experiments confirm that modeling the sampling rate
directly leads to more robust and sampling-rate-agnostic speech quality
predictions.

*Lu Han,Junqi Zhao,Renhua Peng*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: WTFormer是一种新型神经网络，用于多输入多输出（MIMO）语音增强，结合小波变换和多维协作注意力，有效捕捉全局空间特征，同时使用Conformer进行时频建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多通道语音增强系统多为单输出架构，难以在MIMO处理中保持时空信号完整性。

Method: 提出WTFormer，利用小波变换的多分辨率特性和多维协作注意力，结合Conformer进行时频建模，并采用多任务损失策略和MUSIC算法优化训练。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上，WTFormer在仅0.98M参数下，实现了与先进系统相当的降噪性能，同时保留了更多空间信息。

Conclusion: WTFormer在MIMO语音增强中表现出色，有效平衡了降噪性能和空间信息保留。

Abstract: Current multi-channel speech enhancement systems mainly adopt single-output
architecture, which face significant challenges in preserving spatio-temporal
signal integrity during multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel neural network, termed WTFormer,
for MIMO speech enhancement that leverages the multi-resolution characteristics
of wavelet transform and multi-dimensional collaborative attention to
effectively capture globally distributed spatial features, while using
Conformer for time-frequency modeling. A multi task loss strategy accompanying
MUSIC algorithm is further proposed for optimization training to protect
spatial information to the greatest extent. Experimental results on the
LibriSpeech dataset show that WTFormer can achieve comparable denoising
performance to advanced systems while preserving more spatial information with
only 0.98M parameters.

*Shunsuke Mitsumori,Sara Kashiwagi,Keitaro Tanaka,Shigeo Morishima*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于片段级声学标记分布相似性（CATDS）的新方法，用于增强低资源自动语音识别（ASR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言的ASR性能因训练数据有限而下降，现有方法依赖语言级相似性，忽略了片段级变化。

Method: 提出CATDS方法，通过片段级声学标记分布相似性选择与目标语言更匹配的捐赠片段。

Result: 实验表明，CATDS优于传统方法，并能利用之前被认为有害的捐赠语言。

Conclusion: CATDS为低资源ASR提供了一种更精细且有效的捐赠数据选择方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel donor data selection method to enhance
low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR). While ASR performs well in
high-resource languages, its accuracy declines in low-resource settings due to
limited training data. A common solution is to leverage multilingual
self-supervised learning (SSL) models with donor languages. However, existing
methods rely on language-level similarity, overlooking clip-level variations.
To address this limitation, we propose clip-wise acoustic token distribution
similarity (CATDS), a fine-grained selection method that identifies
acoustically relevant donor clips for better alignment with the target
language. Unlike existing clip-level selection methods, our method aligns with
the representation of SSL models and offers more challenging yet valuable
samples. Experimental results show that CATDS outperforms traditional selection
methods and can even utilize donor languages previously considered detrimental.

TL;DR: DiffSoundStream通过减少语义和声学标记的冗余，并利用潜在扩散模型合成高质量波形，提升了语音标记化的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音标记化在自回归建模中受限于标记速率，影响推理速度。

Method: 1. 通过语义标记条件化神经编解码器减少冗余；2. 利用潜在扩散模型从语义和粗粒度声学标记合成波形。

Result: 在50标记/秒下，DiffSoundStream的语音质量与标准SoundStream（100标记/秒）相当，且仅需4步扩散采样。

Conclusion: DiffSoundStream显著提升了语音标记化的效率和质量。

Abstract: Token-based language modeling is a prominent approach for speech generation,
where tokens are obtained by quantizing features from self-supervised learning
(SSL) models and extracting codes from neural speech codecs, generally referred
to as semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. These tokens are often modeled
autoregressively, with the inference speed being constrained by the token rate.
In this work, we propose DiffSoundStream, a solution that improves the
efficiency of speech tokenization in non-streaming scenarios through two
techniques: (1) conditioning the neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize
redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens, and (2) leveraging latent
diffusion models to synthesize high-quality waveforms from semantic and
coarse-level acoustic tokens. Experiments show that at 50 tokens per second,
DiffSoundStream achieves speech quality on par with a standard SoundStream
model operating at twice the token rate. Additionally, we achieve step-size
distillation using just four diffusion sampling steps with only a minor quality
loss.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态分块自回归框架（DCAR），通过动态调整预测范围，显著提升语音合成的效率和清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归语音合成模型在长序列处理中存在延迟和质量问题，限制了实时应用。

Method: 引入动态分块注意力机制，通过多令牌预测训练，动态调整预测范围。

Result: DCAR在测试集上实现了72.27%的清晰度提升和2.61倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: DCAR为下一代语音合成系统提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as a dominant
approach in speech synthesis, offering expressive generation and scalable
training. However, conventional AR speech synthesis models relying on the
next-token prediction paradigm often encounter significant challenges when
handling long speech sequences. These models often struggle to construct stable
frame-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis
quality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise
autoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both
efficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR
introduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with
multi-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech
contexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts
the token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length
dependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional
next-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility
improvement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.
Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile
foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.

TL;DR: 使用卷积循环神经网络（CRNN）同步钢琴音频与MIDI文件，比传统DTW方法准确率提高20%，结合DTW进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决钢琴演奏音频与MIDI文件松散对齐的问题，提升对齐精度。

Method: 采用CRNN架构，输入未对齐的钢琴卷和频谱图，输出对齐的钢琴卷；通过模拟人类计时误差的数据集训练。

Result: 比DTW方法准确率提高20%，结合DTW后效果更稳健。

Conclusion: 神经网络在MIDI与音频对齐任务中具有潜力，可推动技术进步。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach for synchronizing audio
recordings of human piano performances with their corresponding loosely aligned
MIDI files. The task is addressed using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network (CRNN) architecture, which effectively captures spectral and temporal
features by processing an unaligned piano roll and a spectrogram as inputs to
estimate the aligned piano roll. To train the network, we create a dataset of
piano pieces with augmented MIDI files that simulate common human timing
errors. The proposed model achieves up to 20% higher alignment accuracy than
the industry-standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method across various
tolerance windows. Furthermore, integrating DTW with the CRNN yields additional
improvements, offering enhanced robustness and consistency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of neural networks in advancing state-of-the-art
MIDI-to-audio alignment.

TL;DR: WaLi技术通过低分辨率压力传感器数据重建可理解的语音，揭示了压力传感器在隐私方面的潜在威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力传感器在HVAC系统中广泛使用，其工作范围与人类语音相似，可能被用于窃听。

Method: WaLi利用复数卷积和复杂全局注意力块（CGAB）处理低分辨率数据，并消除HVAC噪声。

Result: 实验显示，WaLi在0.5 kHz至8 kHz上采样时，LSD为1.24，NISQA-MOS为1.78。

Conclusion: WaLi的高精度重建能力暴露了压力传感器在隐私保护方面的未解决问题。

Abstract: Pressure sensors are an integrated component of modern Heating, Ventilation,
and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. As these pressure sensors operate within
the 0-10 Pa range, support high sampling frequencies of 0.5-2 kHz, and are
often placed close to human proximity, they can be used to eavesdrop on
confidential conversation, since human speech has a similar audible range of
0-10 Pa and a bandwidth of 4 kHz for intelligible quality. This paper presents
WaLi, which reconstructs intelligible speech from the low-resolution and noisy
pressure sensor data by providing the following technical contributions: (i)
WaLi reconstructs intelligible speech from a minimum of 0.5 kHz sampling
frequency of pressure sensors, whereas previous work can only detect hot
words/phrases. WaLi uses complex-valued conformer and Complex Global Attention
Block (CGAB) to capture inter-phoneme and intra-phoneme dependencies that exist
in the low-resolution pressure sensor data. (ii) WaLi handles the transient
noise injected from HVAC fans and duct vibrations, by reconstructing both the
clean magnitude and phase of the missing frequencies of the low-frequency
aliased components. Extensive measurement studies on real-world pressure
sensors show an LSD of 1.24 and NISQA-MOS of 1.78 for 0.5 kHz to 8 kHz
upsampling. We believe that such levels of accuracy pose a significant threat
when viewed from a privacy perspective that has not been addressed before for
pressure sensors.

Motivation: 现有方法未考虑低功耗实现中的采样频率和比特分辨率降低对语音质量和可懂度的影响，缺乏次奈奎斯特采样下的宽带重建方法。

Method: SUBARU采用次奈奎斯特采样和低比特分辨率ADC，引入多尺度多周期虚拟判别器，实现低功耗和高质量音频处理。

Conclusion: SUBARU为可穿戴设备提供了一种高效、低功耗的语音增强解决方案。

Abstract: Hearables are wearable computers that are worn on the ear. Bone conduction
microphones (BCMs) are used with air conduction microphones (ACMs) in hearables
as a supporting modality for multimodal speech enhancement (SE) in noisy
conditions. However, existing works don't consider the following practical
aspects for low-power implementations on hearables: (i) They do not explore how
lowering the sampling frequencies and bit resolutions in analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) of hearables jointly impact low-power processing and
multimodal SE in terms of speech quality and intelligibility. (ii) They don't
discuss how GAN-like audio quality can be achieved without using actual GAN
discriminators. And (iii) They don't process signals from ACMs/BCMs at
sub-Nyquist sampling rate because, in their frameworks, they lack a wideband
reconstruction methodology from their narrowband parts. We propose SUBARU
(\textbf{Sub}-Nyquist \textbf{A}udio \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{U}psampling),
which achieves the following: SUBARU (i) intentionally uses sub-Nyquist
sampling and low bit resolution in ADCs, achieving a 3.31x reduction in power
consumption; (ii) introduces novel multi-scale and multi-period virtual
discriminators, which achieve GAN-like audio quality without using GANs'
adversarial training; and (iii) achieves streaming operations on mobile
platforms and SE in in-the-wild noisy conditions with an inference time of
1.74ms and a memory footprint of less than 13.77MB.

However, the extensive deployment of RIS elements imposes\nconsiderable channel acquisition overhead, with the high density of nodes and\nantennas in RIS-assisted CF networks amplifying this challenge. To tackle this\nissue, in this paper, we explore integrating RIS-user equipment (UE)\nassociation into downlink RIS-assisted CF transmitter design, which greatly\nreduces the channel acquisition costs. The key point is that once UEs are\nassociated with specific RISs, there is no need to frequently acquire channels\nfrom non-associated RISs. Then, we formulate the problem of joint RIS-UE\nassociation and beamforming at APs and RISs to maximize the weighted sum rate\n(WSR). In particular, we propose a two-stage framework to solve it. In the\nfirst stage, we apply a many-to-many matching algorithm to establish the RIS-UE\nassociation. In the second stage, we introduce a sequential optimization-based\nmethod that decomposes the joint optimization of RIS phase shifts and AP\nbeamforming into two distinct subproblems. To optimize the RIS phase shifts, we\nemploy the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to obtain a\nsemi-closed-form solution. For AP beamforming, we develop a joint block\ndiagonalization algorithm, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that,\nwhile RIS-UE association significantly reduces overhead, it incurs a minor\nperformance loss that remains within an acceptable range.

Various simulation-based studies have shown that ML-based\nfeedback compression can result in reduced overhead and more accurate channel\ninformation. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no real-life\nproofs of concepts demonstrating the benefits of ML-based channel feedback\ncompression in a practical setting, where the user equipment (UE) and base\nstation have no access to each others' ML models. In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach for training interoperable compression and decompression ML\nmodels in a confidential manner, and demonstrate the accuracy of the ensuing\nmodels using prototype UEs and base stations. The performance of the ML-based\nchannel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed\nchannel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the\nchannel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results\ndemonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel\nfeedback link without having to share ML models between device and network\nvendors.

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "summary": "Localizing users and mapping the environment using radio signals is a key\ntask in emerging applications such as reliable communications, location-aware\nsecurity, and safety critical navigation. Recently introduced multipath-based\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) can jointly localize a mobile\nagent and the reflective surfaces in radio frequency (RF) environments. Most\nexisting MP-SLAM methods assume that map features and their corresponding RF\npropagation paths are statistically independent, which neglects inherent\ndependencies arising when a single reflective surface contributes to different\npropagation paths or when an agent communicates with more than one base\nstation. Previous approaches that aim to fuse information across propagation\npaths are limited by their inability to perform ray tracing in environments\nwith nonconvex geometries. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian MP-SLAM method\nfor distributed MIMO systems that addresses this limitation. In particular, we\nuse amplitude statistics to establish adaptive time-varying detection\nprobabilities. Based on the resulting \"soft\" ray-tracing strategy, our method\ncan fuse information across propagation paths in RF environments with nonconvex\ngeometries. A Bayesian estimation method for the joint estimation of map\nfeatures and agent position is established by applying the message passing\nrules of the sum-product algorithm (SPA) to the factor graph that represents\nthe proposed statistical model. We also introduce an improved proposal PDF for\nparticle-based computation of SPA messages. This proposal PDF enables the early\ndetection of new surfaces that are solely supported by double-bounce paths.

However, traditional deep learning approaches for\nECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain.

While previous studies have explored\nSSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail\nto capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals.

In this study, considering a\ncarrier frequency offset (CFO)-resilient multi-user procedure, we derive the\nstatistics of the phase deviations to assess how fast the phase coherency\ndegrades. Our results show that residual CFO is a major factor determining the\nduration of phase coherency, in addition to the non-negligible effects of\nmobility and the number of nodes in the network.

Many existing robust regression methods, either grounded\nin statistical theory or sparse signal recovery, typically rely on the explicit\nor implicit assumption of outlier sparsity to filter anomalies and recover the\nunderlying signal or data. However, these methods often suffer from limited\nrobustness or high computational complexity, rendering them inefficient for\nlarge-scale problems. In this work, we propose a novel robust regression model\nbased on a Self-scaled Approximate l0 Regularization Model (SARM) scheme. By\nintroducing a self-scaling mechanism into the regularization term, the proposed\nmodel mitigates the negative impact of uneven or excessively large outlier\nmagnitudes on robustness. We also develop an alternating minimization algorithm\ngrounded in Proximal Operators and Block Coordinate Descent. We rigorously\nprove the algorithm convergence. Empirical comparisons with several\nstate-of-the-art robust regression methods demonstrate that SARM not only\nachieves superior robustness but also significantly improves computational\nefficiency. Motivated by both the theoretical error bound and empirical\nobservations, we further design a Two-Stage SARM (TSSARM) framework, which\nbetter utilizes sample information when the singular values of the design\nmatrix are widely spread, thereby enhancing robustness under certain\nconditions. Finally, we validate our approach on a real-world load forecasting\ntask. The experimental results show that our method substantially enhances the\nrobustness of load forecasting against adversarial data attacks, which is\nincreasingly critical in the era of heightened data security concerns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7f29\u653e\u8fd1\u4f3cl0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff08SARM\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7a33\u5065\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5SARM\u6846\u67b6\uff08TSSARM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a33\u5065\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSARM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u4e3aTSSARM\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "SARM\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cTSSARM\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SARM\u548cTSSARM\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

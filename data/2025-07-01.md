  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决6G无线系统中RIS辅助的MISO-OFDMA系统下行传输的资源分配挑战，提升系统效率和性能。

Method: 提出两阶段无监督学习框架，包括BeamNet预测RIS相位和AllocationNet分配资源块，结合最大比率传输和注水算法实现波束成形。

Result: 仿真显示该方法达到SCA基线99.93%的和速率，仅需0.036%的运行时间，且在多种信道和用户条件下表现稳健。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless
systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA
system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised
learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS
beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes
BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which
allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active
beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To
handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and
the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training
enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves
99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and
it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于非线性动力学和熵度量的定量框架，用于分类深部脑刺激手术中STN内外的神经活动，提高了定位准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前STN定位依赖主观信号特征解释，缺乏客观定量方法，影响DBS手术效果。

Method: 预处理MER数据，提取非线性、熵和递归量化特征，训练多种分类器并进行统计比较。

Result: 结合熵和非线性特征的Extra Trees分类器表现最佳（F1=0.902，ROC AUC=0.887），测试集验证了泛化能力（F1=0.922，ROC AUC=0.941）。

Conclusion: 非线性与熵特征可支持DBS手术中的实时数据驱动决策，提升STN定位准确性。

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative localization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is
essential for the efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with
Parkinson's disease. While microelectrode recordings (MERs) provide rich
electrophysiological information during DBS electrode implantation, current
localization practices often rely on subjective interpretation of signal
features. In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that leverages
nonlinear dynamics and entropy-based metrics to classify neural activity
recorded inside versus outside the STN. MER data from three patients were
preprocessed using a robust artifact correction pipeline, segmented, and
labelled based on surgical annotations. A comprehensive set of recurrence
quantification analysis, nonlinear, and entropy features were extracted from
each segment. Multiple supervised classifiers were trained on every combination
of feature domains using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, followed by
statistical comparison using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Holm-Bonferroni correction. The combination of entropy and nonlinear features
yielded the highest discriminative power, and the Extra Trees classifier
emerged as the best model with a cross-validated F1-score of 0.902+/-0.027 and
ROC AUC of 0.887+/-0.055. Final evaluation on a 20% hold-out test set confirmed
robust generalization (F1= 0.922, ROC AUC = 0.941). These results highlight the
potential of nonlinear and entropy signal descriptors in supporting real-time,
data-driven decision-making during DBS surgeries

### [3] [Data Normalization Strategies for EEG Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22455)
*Dung Truong,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: EEG深度学习预处理中归一化策略对监督学习和自监督学习任务的影响不同，需根据任务类型选择最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究归一化策略在EEG深度学习中的重要性，特别是在大规模预训练（如自监督学习）与监督学习任务中的差异。

Result: 监督任务中窗口级通道内归一化效果最佳，而自监督任务中窗口级跨通道或最小归一化更有效。

Conclusion: 归一化策略需根据任务类型定制，无通用策略适用于所有学习场景，为EEG深度学习管道设计提供实用指导。

Abstract: Normalization is a critical yet often overlooked component in the
preprocessing pipeline for EEG deep learning applications. The rise of
large-scale pretraining paradigms such as self-supervised learning (SSL)
introduces a new set of tasks whose nature is substantially different from
supervised training common in EEG deep learning applications. This raises new
questions about optimal normalization strategies for the applicable task. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of normalization granularity
(recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on
both supervised (age and gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive
Predictive Coding) tasks. Using high-density resting-state EEG from 2,836
subjects in the Healthy Brain Network dataset, we show that optimal
normalization strategies differ significantly between training paradigms.
Window-level within-channel normalization yields the best performance in
supervised tasks, while minimal or cross-channel normalization at the window
level is more effective for SSL. These results underscore the necessity of
task-specific normalization choices and challenge the assumption that a
universal normalization strategy can generalize across learning settings. Our
findings provide practical insights for developing robust EEG deep learning
pipelines as the field shifts toward large-scale, foundation model training.

### [5] [A Complex UNet Approach for Non-Invasive Fetal ECG Extraction Using Single-Channel Dry Textile Electrodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22457)
*Iulia Orvas,Andrei Radu,Alessandra Galli,Ana Neacsu,Elisabetta Peri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于AI的新方法，用于从干纺织电极的单通道记录中提取胎儿心电图（fECG），解决了噪声和运动伪影问题，并取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家庭环境中连续、无创的胎儿健康监测需要可靠的fECG提取方法，但干纺织电极的噪声和运动伪影增加了技术难度。

Method: 采用基于复数去噪网络（Complex UNet）的创新流程，处理频谱图的实部和虚部，以提取fECG信号。

Result: 该方法在模拟和真实数据上均表现出色，实现了fECG形态的准确提取和R峰检测。

Conclusion: 这是首个成功从干纺织电极单通道记录中提取fECG的方法，为非侵入式家庭监测提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Continuous, non-invasive pregnancy monitoring is crucial for minimising
potential complications. The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) represents a
promising tool for assessing fetal health beyond clinical environments.
Home-based monitoring necessitates the use of a minimal number of comfortable
and durable electrodes, such as dry textile electrodes. However, this setup
presents many challenges, including increased noise and motion artefacts, which
complicate the accurate extraction of fECG signals. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a pioneering method for extracting fECG from
single-channel recordings obtained using dry textile electrodes using AI
techniques. We created a new dataset by simulating abdominal recordings,
including noise closely resembling real-world characteristics of in-vivo
recordings through dry textile electrodes, alongside mECG and fECG. To ensure
the reliability of the extracted fECG, we propose an innovative pipeline based
on a complex-valued denoising network, Complex UNet. Unlike previous approaches
that focused solely on signal magnitude, our method processes both real and
imaginary components of the spectrogram, addressing phase information and
preventing incongruous predictions. We evaluated our novel pipeline against
traditional, well-established approaches, on both simulated and real data in
terms of fECG extraction and R-peak detection. The results showcase that our
suggested method achieves new state-of-the-art results, enabling an accurate
extraction of fECG morphology across all evaluated settings. This method is the
first to effectively extract fECG signals from single-channel recordings using
dry textile electrodes, making a significant advancement towards a fully
non-invasive and self-administered fECG extraction solution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理模型和数据驱动的神经网络（PENN），用于从sEMG信号中准确解码人体运动意图，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sEMG运动估计方法依赖难以校准的特定主体MSK模型或缺乏生理一致性的纯数据驱动模型，需要一种兼顾生理一致性和准确性的新方法。

Method: 提出PENN，结合可解释的MSK前向动力学和数据驱动的残差学习，采用递归时间结构和轻量级CNN进行残差校正，设计两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在六名健康受试者上的实验表明，PENN在RMSE和R²指标上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PENN在保持生理一致性的同时实现了高精度的运动估计，为康复机器人和辅助技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurately decoding human motion intentions from surface electromyography
(sEMG) is essential for myoelectric control and has wide applications in
rehabilitation robotics and assistive technologies. However, existing
sEMG-based motion estimation methods often rely on subject-specific
musculoskeletal (MSK) models that are difficult to calibrate, or purely
data-driven models that lack physiological consistency. This paper introduces a
novel Physics-Embedded Neural Network (PENN) that combines interpretable MSK
forward-dynamics with data-driven residual learning, thereby preserving
physiological consistency while achieving accurate motion estimation. The PENN
employs a recursive temporal structure to propagate historical estimates and a
lightweight convolutional neural network for residual correction, leading to
robust and temporally coherent estimations. A two-phase training strategy is
designed for PENN. Experimental evaluations on six healthy subjects show that
PENN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in both root mean square
error (RMSE) and $R^2$ metrics.

Abstract: Using mobile phone video of the fingertip as a data source for estimating
vital signs such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) during daily life
has long been suggested. While existing literature indicates that these
estimates are accurate to within several beats or breaths per minute, the data
used to draw these conclusions are typically collected in laboratory
environments under careful experimental control, and yet the results are
assumed to generalize to daily life. In an effort to test it, a team of
researchers collected a large dataset of mobile phone video recordings made
during daily life and annotated with ground truth HR and RR labels from N=111
participants. They found that traditional algorithm performance on the
fingerprint videos is worse than previously reported (7 times and 13 times
worse for RR and HR, respectively). Fortunately, recent advancements in deep
learning, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer a promising
solution to improve this performance. This study proposes a new method for
estimating HR and RR using a novel 3D deep CNN, demonstrating a reduced error
in estimated HR by 68% and RR by 75%. These promising results suggest that
regressor-based deep learning approaches should be used in estimating HR and
RR.

Abstract: Groundwater supports ecosystems, agriculture, and drinking water supplies
worldwide, yet effective monitoring remains challenging due to sparse data,
computational constraints, and delayed outputs from traditional approaches. We
develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts groundwater level categories
using climate data, hydro-meteorological records, and physiographic attributes
processed through AutoGluon's automated ensemble framework. Our approach
integrates geospatial preprocessing, domain-driven feature engineering, and
automated model selection to overcome conventional monitoring limitations.
Applied to a large-scale French dataset (n $>$ 3,440,000 observations from
1,500+ wells), the model achieves weighted F\_1 scores of 0.927 on validation
data and 0.67 on temporally distinct test data. Scenario-based evaluations
demonstrate practical utility for early warning systems and water allocation
decisions under changing climate conditions. The open-source implementation
provides a scalable framework for integrating machine learning into national
groundwater monitoring networks, enabling more responsive and data-driven water
management strategies.

Abstract: Fall detection is critical to support the growing elderly population,

address the challenges of data scarcity by utilizing a Fall Detection
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (FD-GPT) that uses augmentation techniques.
We developed a protocol to collect a comprehensive dataset of the elderly daily
activities and fall events. This resulted in a real dataset that carefully
mimics the elderly's routine. We rigorously evaluate and compare various models
using this dataset. Experimental results show our approach achieves 90.72%
accuracy and 89.33% precision in distinguishing between fall events and regular
activities of daily living.

Conclusion: 该方法使AFDM在高移动性通信中的应用更可行，为下一代通信系统的实现铺平了道路。

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising chirp-assisted
multicarrier waveform for future high mobility communications. A significant
challenge in MIMO-AFDM systems is the multi-user interference (MUI), which can
be effectively addressed by employing precoding techniques. However, the
complexity introduced by AFDM makes the precoding process computationally
expensive and challenging. To overcome this issue, We combine AFDM channel
sparse property and using Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method to
iteratively process the precoding, thereby reducing the complexity of the
precoding design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
sparsification approach, coupled with the PCG method, achieving quite precoding
performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. This makes
the application of AFDM more feasible and efficient for high-mobility
communication scenarios, paving the way for its broader implementation in
next-generation communication systems.

model was tested on two separate sets: one with 28 MRIs representing common
sequence types, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of
88.45%, and another with 18 MRIs featuring less frequent sequences and
abnormalities such as muscular atrophy, hardware, and significant noise,
achieving 86.21% DSC. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a fully

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role today in smart building
infrastructures, from simple smart-home applications, to more sophisticated
industrial type installations. The vast amounts of data generated from relevant
systems can be processed in different ways revealing important information.
This is especially true in the era of edge computing, when advanced data
analysis and decision-making is gradually moving to the edge of the network
where devices are generally characterised by low computing resources. In this
context, one of the emerging main challenges is related to maintaining data
analysis accuracy even with less data that can be efficiently handled by low
resource devices. The present work focuses on correlation analysis of data
retrieved from a pilot IoT network installation monitoring a small smart office
by means of environmental and energy consumption sensors. The research
motivation was to find statistical correlation between the monitoring variables
that will allow the use of machine learning (ML) prediction algorithms for
energy consumption reducing input parameters. For this to happen, a series of
hypothesis tests for the correlation of three different environmental variables
with the energy consumption were carried out. A total of ninety tests were
performed, thirty for each pair of variables. In these tests, p-values showed
the existence of strong or semi-strong correlation with two environmental
variables, and of a weak correlation with a third one. Using the proposed
methodology, we manage without examining the entire data set to exclude weak
correlated variables while keeping the same score of accuracy.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态数据和AI技术显著提升了动态V2X场景中波束成形的准确性和鲁棒性，且适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Integrating sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a cornerstone
technology for predictive beamforming in 6G-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
networks. However, existing ISAC paradigms rely solely on radio frequency (RF)
signal, limiting sensing resolution and robustness in V2X environments with
high mobility and multipath interference. Fortunately, the widespread
deployment of diverse non-RF sensors such as cameras and LiDAR, along with the
integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication systems, offers
new opportunities to improve the synergy between sensing and communication.
Motivated by this, this work develops a novel and robust communication
framework that leverages multi-modal sensing data and advanced AI technologies
to assist beamforming in dynamic and realistic vehicular scenarios.
Specifically, we propose a multi-modal learning framework for predictive
beamforming that integrates modality-specific branches and employs hierarchical
Transformer to capture cross-modal features. By exploiting the intrinsic
correlation between multi-modal sensing data and beamforming decisions, this
design enhances the accuracy and robustness of beamforming in dynamic V2X
scenarios. To enable practical deployment on resource-constrained edge device
(i.e., the roadside unit), we then develop a module-aware compression strategy
that significantly reduces inference latency while preserving model
performance. Furthermore, to address potential modality missing in real-world
scenarios, we introduce a generative model that is able to reconstruct missing
inputs from available observations, allowing the framework to operate reliably
even under incomplete sensing conditions. Extensive simulation results
conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme
consistently outperforms existing baselines across various metrics.

Method: 将问题建模为持续学习任务，并比较了三种适应方法：基于损失感知的重放、突触重要性正则化和无记忆的学习-不遗忘。

Result: 在三种3GPP城市微场景中，最佳重放和正则化方案将高信噪比误差降低了2 dB（约35%），轻量级蒸馏方法也比基线提升了30%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，目标重放和参数锚定对切换鲁棒的信道预测至关重要，并建议在3GPP-NR和O-RAN中嵌入持续学习钩子。

Abstract: Modern 5G/6G deployments routinely face cross-configuration handovers--users
traversing cells with different antenna layouts, carrier frequencies, and
scattering statistics--which inflate channel-prediction NMSE by $37.5\%$ on
average when models are naively fine-tuned. The proposed improvement frames
this mismatch as a continual-learning problem and benchmarks three adaptation
families: replay with loss-aware reservoirs, synaptic-importance
regularization, and memory-free learning-without-forgetting. Across three
representative 3GPP urban micro scenarios, the best replay and regularization
schemes cut the high-SNR error floor by up to 2~dB ($\approx 35\%$), while even
the lightweight distillation recovers up to $30\%$ improvement over baseline
handover prediction schemes. These results show that targeted rehearsal and
parameter anchoring are essential for handover-robust CSI prediction and
suggest a clear migration path for embedding continual-learning hooks into
current channel prediction efforts in 3GPP--NR and O-RAN. The full codebase can

Abstract: Spiders use their webs as multifunctional tools that enable capturing and
localizing prey and more general environmental sensing through vibrations.
Inspired by their biological function, we present a spider web-inspired optical
waveguide system for resilient impulse detection and localization. The
structure consists of six clear thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) waveguides
arranged radially and interconnected by a spiral TPU thread, mimicking orb
spider webs. Light transmission losses, induced by vibrations, are measured via
coupled LEDs and photo-diodes, allowing real-time detection. We systematically
characterize individual waveguides, analyzing key parameters such as tension,
impulse position, and break angle to optimize vibrational response. The
complete system is validated through controlled experiments, revealing a 5 ms
propagation delay in vibration transfer between adjacent radii, enhancing
localization capabilities. We demonstrate a robust impulse detection and
localization algorithm leveraging time delay analysis, achieving reliable event
identification even in cases of sensor failure. This study highlights the
potential of bioinspired optical waveguide structures for adaptive sensing,
with applications in soft robotics, structural monitoring, and environmental

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的基础模型，用于跨程序技能评估，通过自监督学习在fNIRS信号上预训练，实现了高分类准确率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有fNIRS方法通常任务特定、预处理复杂且对新条件缺乏鲁棒性，需要一种更通用且可解释的模型。

Method: 使用自监督学习预训练Transformer模型，结合轻量级适配模块和通道注意力机制，用于跨程序技能评估。

Result: 模型在多个任务上分类准确率超过88%，MCC超过0.91，并在新任务上使用少量样本达到AUC大于87%。

Conclusion: 该模型在技能评估中表现出高效性和泛化能力，同时通过注意力机制提供了可解释性。

Abstract: Objective skill assessment in high-stakes procedural environments requires
models that not only decode underlying cognitive and motor processes but also
generalize across tasks, individuals, and experimental contexts. While prior
work has demonstrated the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS) for evaluating cognitive-motor performance, existing approaches are
often task-specific, rely on extensive preprocessing, and lack robustness to
new procedures or conditions. Here, we introduce an interpretable
transformer-based foundation model trained on minimally processed fNIRS signals
for cross-procedural skill assessment. Pretrained using self-supervised
learning on data from laparoscopic surgical tasks and endotracheal intubation
(ETI), the model achieves greater than 88% classification accuracy on all
tasks, with Matthews Correlation Coefficient exceeding 0.91 on ETI. It
generalizes to a novel emergency airway procedure--cricothyrotomy--using fewer
than 30 labeled samples and a lightweight (less than 2k parameter) adapter
module, attaining an AUC greater than 87%. Interpretability is achieved via a
novel channel attention mechanism--developed specifically for fNIRS--that
identifies functionally coherent prefrontal sub-networks validated through
ablation studies. Temporal attention patterns align with task-critical phases
and capture stress-induced changes in neural variability, offering insight into
dynamic cognitive states.

Conclusion: 关系领域学习有助于实现可扩展、无目标部署的BCI系统。

Abstract: Accurate decoding of lower-limb motion from EEG signals is essential for
advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in movement intent
recognition and control. However, challenges persist in achieving causal,
phase-consistent predictions and in modeling both inter- and intra-subject
variability. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDyGait, a
domain-generalizable EEG-to-motion decoding framework that leverages structured
contrastive representation learning and relational domain modeling. The
proposed method employs relative contrastive learning to achieve semantic
alignment between EEG and motion embeddings. Furthermore, a multi-cycle gait
reconstruction objective is introduced to enforce temporal coherence and
maintain biomechanical consistency. To promote inter-session generalization,
during fine-tuning, a domain dynamic decoding mechanism adaptively assigns
session-specific prediction heads and learns to mix their outputs based on
inter-session relationships. NeuroDyGait enables zero-shot motion prediction
for unseen individuals without requiring adaptation and achieves superior
performance in cross-subject gait decoding on benchmark datasets. Additionally,
it demonstrates strong phase-detection capabilities even without explicit phase
supervision during training. These findings highlight the potential of
relational domain learning in enabling scalable, target-free deployment of
BCIs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG诊断中，监督模型容易忽略细微但临床关键的信号（简单性偏差），自监督学习（SSL）可能缓解这一问题。

Method: 1）时间-频率感知滤波器捕捉ECG信号的动态特征；2）多粒度原型重建实现双域粗-细粒度表示学习。

Result: 在六个ECG数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效减少SB并达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 自监督学习是解决ECG分析中简单性偏差的有效方向，提出的方法具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic
characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform
deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised
ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking
fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity
Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but
informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence
of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while
simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate
it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL
paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1)
Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features
reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this,
Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation
learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG
analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million
recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream
tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces
SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released
publicly.

Conclusion: 该技术为高频滤波器设定了新标准，有望推动下一代通信系统的发展。

Abstract: This paper presents significant frequency scaling of acoustic filter
technology to 50 GHz. This achievement is enabled by the P3F LiNbO3 multilayer
stack, in which piezoelectric thin-films of alternating orientations are
transferred in sequence, thereby allowing efficient exploitation of high-order
modes with high quality factor (Q) and coupling coefficient (k2) in a thicker
piezoelectric stack. The demonstrated filter is comprised of twelfth-order
symmetric (S12) mode lateral-field-excited bulk acoustic wave resonators
(XBARs), built on a 4-layer periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) 128 Y-cut
lithium niobate (LiNbO3) stack. The filter exhibits 3.3 dB insertion loss (IL)
and a fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 2.9%. The miniature design, with a
footprint of 0.36 mm2, makes it promising for future wireless front-end
applications. These results represent the highest frequency acoustic filters
reported to date, setting a new benchmark in piezoelectric filter technology.
Upon further development, the platform could enable filters further into the
FR2 range, essential for next-generation communication systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信道知识地图（CKM）的双域跟踪和预测波束成形方案，用于高移动性无线网络，显著提升了目标和波束跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高移动性无线网络中，目标和波束跟踪面临挑战，尤其是在非视距（NLoS）条件下。CKM的引入旨在通过双域信息交互提升跟踪精度。

Method: 在坐标域（C-Domain）使用扩展卡尔曼滤波（EKF）跟踪接收器状态，在波束域（B-Domain）利用CKM提供角度到达（AoA）先验信息，设计联合预测波束成形和功率分配方案。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方案在目标和波束跟踪性能上显著优于现有方法，尤其在非视距路径的AoA跟踪中表现突出。

Conclusion: CKM通过双域信息交互有效提升了高移动性通信中的跟踪性能，展示了其在未来无线网络中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel channel knowledge map (CKM)-assisted
dual-domain tracking and predictive beamforming scheme for high-mobility
wireless networks. The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the
coordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via
treating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate
domain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and
track the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication
receiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and
LoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath
channel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain
(B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a
priori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated
to establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on
the angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cram\'er-Rao
Bound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and
propose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to
minimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking
accuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements
in both target and beam tracking performance compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, particularly in AoA tracking of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths,
highlighting the potential gain of CKM in facilitating both target and beam
tracking in high-mobility communications.

Abstract: In recent years, security has emerged as a critical aspect of integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. While significant research has
focused on secure communications, particularly in ensuring physical layer
security, the issue of sensing security has received comparatively less
attention. This paper addresses the sensing security problem in ISAC,
particularly under the threat of multi-intercept adversaries. We consider a
realistic scenario in which the sensing target is an advanced electronic
reconnaissance aircraft capable of employing multiple signal interception
techniques, such as power detection (PD) and cyclostationary analysis (CA). To
evaluate sensing security under such sophisticated threats, we analyze two
critical features of the transmitted signal: (i) power distribution and (ii)
cyclic spectrum. Further, we introduce a novel ergodic cyclic spectrum metric
which leverages the intrinsic mathematical structure of cyclostationary signals
to more comprehensively characterize their behavior. Building on this analysis,
we formulate a new ISAC design problem that explicitly considers sensing
security, and we develop a low-complexity, efficient optimization approach to
solve it. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed metric is both
effective and insightful, and that our ISAC design significantly enhances
sensing security performance in the presence of multi-intercept threats.

Conclusion: 研究为6 GHz频段下Wi-Fi 6E和5G NR-U的公平共存提供了参数调优建议。

Abstract: The ever-increasing demand for broadband and IoT wireless connectivity has
recently urged the regulators around the world to start opening the 6 GHz
spectrum for unlicensed use. These bands will, for example, permit the use of
additional 1.2 GHz in the US and 500 MHz in Europe for unlicensed radio access
technologies (RATs) such as Wi-Fi and 5G New Radio Unlicensed (5G NR-U). To
support QoS-sensitive applications with both technologies, fair and efficient
coexistence approaches between the two RATs, as well as with incumbents already
operating in the 6 GHz band, are crucial. In this paper, we study through
extensive simulations the achievable mean downlink throughput of both Wi-Fi 6E
APs and 5G NR-U gNBs when they are co-deployed in a dense residential scenario
under high-interference conditions. We also explore how different parameter
settings e.g., MAC frame aggregation, energy detection threshold and maximum
channel occupancy time (MCOT) affect the coexistence. Our findings give
important insights into how to tune the key parameters to design fair
coexistence policies.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is essential to unlock the potential of
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in wireless communication systems.
Since massive RIS elements are typically implemented without baseband signal
processing capabilities, limited CSI feedback is necessary when designing the
reflection/refraction coefficients of the RIS. In this article, the unique
RIS-assisted channel features, such as the RIS position-dependent channel
fluctuation, the ultra-high dimensional sub-channel matrix, and the structured
sparsity, are distilled from recent advances in limited feedback and used as
guidelines for designing feedback schemes. We begin by illustrating the use
cases and the corresponding challenges associated with RIS feedback. We then
discuss how to leverage techniques such as channel customization,
structured-sparsity, autoencoders, and others to reduce feedback overhead and
complexity when devising feedback schemes. Finally, we identify potential
research directions by considering the unresolved challenges, the new RIS
architecture, and the integration with multi-modal information and artificial
intelligence.

Abstract: The ambiguity function is fundamental to radar waveform design,
characterizing range and Doppler resolution capabilities. However, its
traditional formulation involves non-differentiable operations, preventing
integration with gradient-based optimization methods and modern machine
learning frameworks. This paper presents the first complete mathematical
framework and computational implementation for differentiable radar ambiguity
functions. Our approach addresses the fundamental technical challenges that
have prevented the radar community from leveraging automatic differentiation:
proper handling of complex-valued gradients using Wirtinger calculus, efficient
computation through parallelized FFT operations, numerical stability throughout
cascaded operations, and composability with arbitrary differentiable
operations. We term this approach GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity
Functions), which reformulates the ambiguity function computation to maintain
mathematical equivalence while enabling gradient flow through the entire
pipeline. The resulting implementation provides a general-purpose
differentiable ambiguity function compatible with modern automatic
differentiation frameworks, enabling new research directions including neural
network-based waveform generation with ambiguity constraints, end-to-end
optimization of radar systems, and integration of classical radar theory with
modern deep learning. We provide complete implementation details and
demonstrate computational efficiency suitable for practical applications. This
work establishes the mathematical and computational foundation for applying
modern machine learning techniques to radar waveform design, bridging classical

jointly optimize the transmit beamforming and the semantic compression rate at
the BS, as well as the selection of activated ports in FAS, to maximize the
equivalent transmission ratio under a specific power budget. We design an
alternating algorithm to solve the problem, where we obtain the optimal
semantic compression ratio is in closed form at each step. Simulation results

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Zak-OTFS调制的无线通信方法，通过延迟-多普勒域的信道估计和低复杂度均衡技术，解决了CP-OFDM在移动性和延迟扩展下的频域信道响应获取难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CP-OFDM在移动性和延迟扩展下难以获取完整的频域信道响应，导致信道估计和均衡复杂度高。Zak-OTFS调制通过延迟-多普勒域的信道估计，简化了这一过程。

Method: 利用Zak-OTFS调制将信息符号转换到延迟-多普勒域进行信道估计，再通过CP-OFDM实现低复杂度均衡，复杂度从O(M^3N^3)降至O(M^2N^2)。

Result: 提出的方法能够高效获取完整的频域信道响应，无需传统导频信号，并减少了对载波间距调整的需求。

Conclusion: Zak-OTFS与CP-OFDM结合的方法显著降低了信道均衡复杂度，同时提升了移动环境下的通信效率。

Abstract: We communicate over wireless channels by first estimating and then equalizing
the effective channel. In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation
the carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a
quasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and
Doppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the
channel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a
single Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can
be used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. This makes
channel estimation straightforward, and there is no loss in spectral efficiency
since it is possible to design data and pilot signals that are mutually
unbiased. However, the naive approach to equalization has complexity ${\mathcal
O}(M^3N^3)$ where $M$ and $N$ are respectively the number of delay and Doppler
bins in an OTFS frame. We simplify equalization by transforming Zak-OTFS
information symbols to CP-OFDM (cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing) modulation.
  Why not simply communicate with CP-OFDM? Inter-carrier interference (ICI) in
CP-OFDM makes it is very challenging to acquire the complete frequency domain
(FD) channel response between subcarriers in the presence of mobility and delay
spread. We avoid this difficulty by estimating the effective channel in the DD
domain from which we are able to reconstruct the complete FD channel response.
We take advantage of CP-OFDM to design an ${\mathcal O}(M^2N^2)$ low-complexity
method of jointly equalizing all subcarriers, where $MN$ is the number of
subcarriers. Our approach removes the need for traditional pilots in CP-OFDM
and reduces the need to vary carrier spacing with mobility.

Conclusion: 该框架为DISAC系统提供了一种高效且鲁棒的多目标跟踪解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed integrated sensing and communication (DISAC) systems are key
enablers for 6G networks, offering the capability to jointly track multiple
targets using spatially distributed base stations (BSs). A fundamental
challenge in DISAC is the seamless and efficient handover of target tracks
between BSs with partially overlapping fields of view, especially in dense and
dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel target handover
framework based on belief propagation (BP) for multi-target tracking in DISAC
systems. By representing the probabilistic data association and tracking
problem through a factor graph, the proposed method enables efficient marginal
inference with reduced computational complexity. Our framework introduces a
principled handover criterion and message-passing strategy that minimizes
inter-BS communication while maintaining tracking continuity and accuracy. We
demonstrate that the proposed handover procedure achieves performance
comparable to centralized processing, yet significantly reduces data exchange
and processing overhead. Extensive simulations validate the robustness of the

Motivation: 设计一种低复杂度、高性能的目标方向值融合方法，减少对先验知识的依赖，适用于未来6G无线网络中的大规模H$^2$AD结构。

Method: 提出CRLB-ratio-WF方法，通过天线数倒数近似子阵列的逆CRLB，避免实时CRLB计算；构建MBDNN，利用多子阵列候选角度增强DOA感知。

Result: CRLB-ratio-WF方法性能接近基于CRLB的方法，且显著减少先验知识依赖；MBDNN在低信噪比（SNR=-15dB）下估计精度提升一个数量级。

Conclusion: CRLB-ratio-WF和MBDNN方法为6G无线网络提供了高效、低复杂度的DOA感知解决方案，尤其在低信噪比环境下表现优异。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, massive H$^2$AD is viewed as a potential
technology for the future 6G wireless network. For such a structure, it is a
challenging task to design a low-complexity and high-performance fusion of
target direction values sensed by different sub-array groups with fewer use of
prior knowledge. To address this issue, a lightweight Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB)-ratio-weight fusion (WF) method is proposed, which approximates inverse
CRLB of each subarray using antenna number reciprocals to eliminate real-time
CRLB computation. This reduces complexity and prior knowledge dependence while
preserving fusion performance. Moreover, a multi-branch deep neural network
(MBDNN) is constructed to further enhance direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensing by
leveraging candidate angles from multiple subarrays. The subarray-specific
branch networks are integrated with a shared regression module to effectively
eliminate pseudo-solutions and fuse true angles. Simulation results show that
the proposed CRLB-ratio-WF method achieves DOA sensing performance comparable
to CRLB-based methods, while significantly reducing the reliance on prior
knowledge. More notably, the proposed MBDNN has superior performance in low-SNR
ranges. At SNR $= -15$ dB, it achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in
estimation accuracy compared to CRLB-ratio-WF method.

Abstract: As the US rapidly moves towards cleaner energy sources, solar energy is fast
becoming the pillar of its renewable energy mix. Even while solar energy is
increasingly being used, its variability is a key hindrance to grid stability,
storage efficiency, and system stability overall. Solar energy has emerged as
one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the United States,
adding noticeably to the country's energy mix. Retrospectively, the necessity
of inserting the sun's energy into the grid without disrupting reliability and
cost efficiencies highlights the necessity of good forecasting software and
smart control systems. The dataset utilized for this research project comprised
both hourly and daily solar energy production records collected from multiple
utility-scale solar farms across diverse U.S. regions, including California,
Texas, and Arizona. Training and evaluation of all models were performed with a
time-based cross-validation scheme, namely, sliding window validation. Both the
Random Forest and the XG-Boost models demonstrated noticeably greater and the
same performance across each of the measures considered, with relatively high
accuracy. The almost perfect and equal performance by the Random Forest and
XG-Boost models also shows both models to have learned the patterns in the data
very comprehensively, with high reliability in their predictions. By
incorporating AI-powered time-series models like XG-Boost in grid management
software, utility companies can dynamically modify storage cycles in real-time
as well as dispatch and peak load planning, based on their predictions.
AI-powered solar forecasting also has profound implications for renewable
energy policy and planning, particularly as U.S. federal and state governments
accelerate toward ambitious decarbonization goals.

Abstract: Polarization diversity offers a cost- and space-efficient solution to enhance
the performance of integrated sensing and communication systems. Polarimetric
sensing exploits the signal's polarity to extract details about the target such
as shape, pose, and material composition. From a communication perspective,
polarization diversity can enhance the reliability and throughput of
communication channels. This paper proposes an integrated polarimetric sensing
and communication (IPSAC) system that jointly conducts polarimetric sensing and
communications. We study the use of single-port polarization-reconfigurable
antennas to adapt to channel depolarization effects, without the need for
separate RF chains for each polarization. We address the problem of optimizing
waveforms and polarizations based on two sensing metrics. We first consider
minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the target depolarization parameter
estimate, which is a critical task for various polarimetric radar applications
such as rainfall forecasting, vegetation identification, and target
classification. To address this nonconvex problem, we apply semi-definite
relaxation (SDR) and majorization-minimization (MM) optimization techniques.
Next, we consider a design that maximizes the target
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) leveraging prior knowledge of
the target and clutter depolarization statistics to enhance the target
detection performance. To tackle this problem, we modify the solution developed
for MSE minimization subject to the same quality-of-service (QoS) constraints.
Extensive simulations show that the proposed polarization reconfiguration
method substantially improves the depolarization parameter MSE. Furthermore,
the proposed method considerably boosts the target SINR due to polarization
diversity, particularly in cluttered environments.

Motivation: LEO卫星通信在实时应用中需要进一步降低延迟，而传统的光电转换在多跳链路中引入了不必要的处理延迟。

Method: 提出了一种基于OHL的全光中继系统，并与传统的AF和DF方案进行比较，同时提出了一种联合优化策略以实时调整OHL参数。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在大型LEO网络中有效降低了错误率和延迟。

Conclusion: OHL中继系统结合实时优化策略是下一代卫星间通信系统的可行方案。

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are emerging as a key enabler
of next-generation communications, offering global coverage and significantly
lower latency compared to traditional terrestrial networks and geostationary
satellites. However, further latency reduction is essential for time-critical
applications such as real-time sensing, autonomous systems, and interactive
services. One critical bottleneck is the optical-to-electrical (O/E) and
electrical-to-optical (E/O) conversions at intermediate nodes in multi-hop
links, which introduce unwanted processing delays. To address this, we
investigate an all-optical relay system based on Optical Hard Limiters (OHL),
which operate purely in the optical domain to suppress noise and restore signal
quality without requiring O/E conversions. First, we present a rigorous
analysis of inter-satellite multi-relay communication under the OHL relaying
architecture, comparing it against conventional Amplify-and-Forward (AF) and
Decode-and-Forward (DF) schemes. Through this comparison, we highlight both the
advantages and limitations of OHL relays, including their particular
sensitivity to parameter choices such as the threshold setting and divergence
angle at the transmitter. Recognizing that a LEO constellation is inherently
time-varying - satellites move relative to one another, causing continuous
changes in link distances and tracking errors - we propose a joint optimization
strategy. This scheme adaptively tunes the OHL decision threshold and beam
divergence in real time to maintain optimal performance, ultimately lowering
error rates and latency. Extensive simulations in a large-scale LEO network
demonstrate the viability of our method and offer insights into practical
implementation for next-generation inter-satellite communication systems.

Conclusion: 提出的动态信号模型为里德堡原子接收器的性能优化提供了理论基础，并展示了量子接收器的潜在优势。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers represent a transformative approach to achieving
high-sensitivity, broadband, and miniaturized radio frequency (RF) reception.
However, existing static signal models for Rydberg atomic receivers rely on the
steady-state assumption of atomic quantum states, which cannot fully describe
the signal reception process of dynamic signals. To fill in this gap, in this
paper, we present a general model to compute the dynamic signal response of
Rydberg atomic receivers in closed form. Specifically, by applying small-signal
perturbation techniques to the quantum master equation, we derive closed-form
Laplace domain transfer functions that characterize the receiver's dynamic
responses to time-varying signal fields. To gain more insights into the
quantum-based RF-photocurrent conversion process, we further introduce the
concept of quantum transconductance that describes the quantum system as an
equivalent classical system. By applying quantum transconductance, we quantify
the influence of in-band blackbody radiation (BBR) noise on the atomic receiver
sensitivity. Extensive simulations for Rydberg atomic receivers validate the
proposed signal model, and demonstrate the possibility of quantum receivers to
outperform classical electronic receivers through the improvement of quantum
transconductance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型阵列毫米波雷达的相位漂移问题需要周期性校准，现有方法依赖人工参考或精度不足。

Method: AutoCalib通过生成空间频谱模板，匹配和评分机制识别环境中的稳定相位参考（ARA），并选择最优参考进行校准。

Result: 在11种环境中实验表明，AutoCalib能识别现有方法遗漏的ARA，相位误差减少74%，性能优于现有方法83%。

Conclusion: AutoCalib不仅解决了雷达校准问题，还支持其他依赖相位的应用，性能接近人工参考的96%。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar systems with large array have pushed radar
sensing into a new era, thanks to their high angular resolution. However, our
long-term experiments indicate that array elements exhibit phase drift over
time and require periodic phase calibration to maintain high-resolution,
creating an obstacle for practical high-resolution mmWave sensing.
Unfortunately, existing calibration methods are inadequate for periodic
recalibration, either because they rely on artificial references or fail to
provide sufficient precision. To address this challenge, we introduce
AutoCalib, the first framework designed to automatically and accurately
calibrate high-resolution mmWave radars by identifying Ambient Radio Anchors
(ARAs)-naturally existing objects in ambient environments that offer stable
phase references. AutoCalib achieves calibration by first generating spatial
spectrum templates based on theoretical electromagnetic characteristics. It
then employs a pattern-matching and scoring mechanism to accurately detect
these anchors and select the optimal one for calibration. Extensive experiments
across 11 environments demonstrate that AutoCalib capable of identifying ARAs
that existing methods miss due to their focus on strong reflectors. AutoCalib's
calibration performance approaches corner reflectors (74% phase error
reduction) while outperforming existing methods by 83%. Beyond radar
calibration, AutoCalib effectively supports other phase-dependent applications
like handheld imaging, delivering 96% of corner reflector calibration
performance without artificial references.

Conclusion: 本文提出的联合优化和SL-MDTS方案有效解决了CF-mMIMO ISAC系统中的多目标感知挑战，显著提升了感知精度。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), as a technology enabled seamless
connection between communication and sensing, is regarded a core enabling
technology for these applications. However, the accuracy of single-node sensing
in ISAC system is limited, prompting the emergence of multi-node cooperative
sensing. In multi-node cooperative sensing, the synchronization error limits
the sensing accuracy, which can be mitigated by the architecture of cell-free
massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO), since the multiple nodes are
interconnected via optical fibers with high synchronization accuracy. However,
the multi-node cooperative sensing in CF-mMIMO ISAC systems faces the following
challenges: 1) The joint optimization of placement and resource allocation of
distributed access points (APs) to improve the sensing performance in
multi-target detection scenario is difficult; 2) The fusion of the sensing
information from distributed APs with multi-view discrepancies is difficult. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a joint placement and antenna
resource optimization scheme for distributed APs to minimize the sensing
Cramr-Rao bound for targets' parameters within the area of interest. Then, a
symbol-level fusion-based multi-dynamic target sensing (SL-MDTS) scheme is
provided, effectively fusing sensing information from multiple APs. The
simulation results validate the effectiveness of the joint optimization scheme
and the superiority of the SL-MDTS scheme. Compared to state-of-the-art
grid-based symbol-level sensing information fusion schemes, the proposed
SL-MDTS scheme improves the accuracy of localization and velocity estimation by
44 % and 41.4 %, respectively.

Motivation: 随着XL-MIMO技术的应用，更多用户可能位于近场区域，需要研究NF信道的新特性及其对系统性能的影响。

Method: 回顾现有NF信道模型，分析其与3GPP TR 38.901模型的差异，并通过仿真评估NF与FF技术在波束成形增益和可达速率上的表现。

Result: 仿真显示，在NF区域使用FF技术时，波束增益损失小于3 dB，可达速率损失小于3%，但NF技术仍有其必要性。

Conclusion: 尽管FF技术在NF区域表现尚可，但NF收发技术在某些场景下仍不可或缺。

Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is regarded as
a promising technology for next-generation communication systems. However, this
will expand the near-field (NF) range, rendering more users more likely to be
located in the NF region. In this paper, we aim to answer two questions: What
are the new characteristics of the NF channel? Is it necessary to develop new
transciver techniques to maintain system performance within the NF region? To
this end, we first review current NF channel models and analyze the differences
between the existing 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model and the NF channel model,
including the spherical wavefront and spatially non-stationarity. Then, we
provide examples on how these differences affect the XL-MIMO system performance
in terms of beamforming gain and achievable rate. Simulation results
demonstrate that, when using far-field (FF) technique under the NF channel, the
maximum normalized beam gain loss is less than 3 dB for most users in the NF
region defined by Rayleigh distance. Moreover, the achievable rate loss of beam
training is less than 3% compared to that realized by NF technique. Finally, we
demonstrate the necessity of employing NF transceiver techniques based on
simulation results.

Conclusion: 该架构灵活高效，适用于实际无线通信场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we design a deep learning-based convolutional autoencoder for
channel coding and modulation. The objective is to develop an adaptive scheme
capable of operating at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)s without the need
for re-training. Additionally, the proposed framework allows validation by
testing all possible codes in the codebook, as opposed to previous AI-based
encoder/decoder frameworks which relied on testing only a small subset of the
available codes. This limitation in earlier methods often led to unreliable
conclusions when generalized to larger codebooks. In contrast to previous
methods, our multi-level encoding and decoding approach splits the message into
blocks, where each encoder block processes a distinct group of $B$ bits. By
doing so, the proposed scheme can exhaustively test $2^{B}$ possible codewords
for each encoder/decoder level, constituting a layer of the overall scheme. The
proposed model was compared to classical polar codes and TurboAE-MOD schemes,
showing improved reliability with achieving comparable, or even superior
results in some settings. Notably, the architecture can adapt to different SNRs
by selectively removing one of the encoder/decoder layers without re-training,
thus demonstrating flexibility and efficiency in practical wireless
communication scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过重用数据传输实现感知，可提升多源定位和波束管理性能，支持3GPP向6G的演进。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) represents a key paradigm for
future wireless networks. However, existing approaches require waveform
modifications, dedicated pilots, or overhead that complicates standards
integration. We propose sensing for free - performing multi-source localization
without pilots by reusing uplink data symbols, making sensing occur during
transmission and directly compatible with 3GPP 5G NR and 6G specifications.
With ever-increasing devices in dense 6G networks, this approach is
particularly compelling when combined with sparse arrays, which can localize
more sources than uniform arrays via an enlarged virtual array. Existing
pilot-free multi-source localization algorithms first reconstruct an extended
covariance matrix and apply subspace methods, incurring cubic complexity and
limited to second-order statistics. Performance degrades under non-Gaussian
data symbols and few snapshots, and higher-order statistics remain unexploited.
We address these challenges with an attention-only transformer that directly
processes raw signal snapshots for grid-less end-to-end direction-of-arrival
(DOA) estimation. The model efficiently captures higher-order statistics while
being permutation-invariant and adaptive to varying snapshot counts. Our
algorithm greatly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-based benchmarks with over
30x reduction in parameters and runtime, and enjoys excellent generalization
under practical mismatches. Applied to multi-user MIMO beam training, our
algorithm can localize uplink DOAs of multiple users during data transmission.
Through angular reciprocity, estimated uplink DOAs prune downlink beam sweeping
candidates and improve throughput via sensing-assisted beam management. This
work shows how reusing existing data transmission for sensing can enhance both
multi-source localization and beam management in 3GPP efforts towards 6G.

Abstract: Ultra-reliable underwater acoustic (UWA) communications serve as one of the
key enabling technologies for future space-air-ground-underwater integrated
networks. However, the reliability of current UWA transmission is still
insufficient since severe performance degradation occurs for conventional
multicarrier systems in UWA channels with severe delay-scale spread. To solve
this problem, we exploit learning-inspired approaches to optimize the
modulation scheme under the assumption of linear minimum mean square error
(LMMSE) equalization, where the discrete representation of waveforms is adopted
by utilizing Nyquist filters. The optimization problem is first transferred
into maximizing the fairness of estimation mean square error (MSE) for each
data symbol since the total MSE is invariant considering the property of
orthogonal modulation. The Siamese architecture is then adopted to obtain
consistent optimization results across various channel conditions, which avoids
the overhead of online feedback, cooperation, and deployment of neural networks
and guarantees generalization. The overall scheme including the loss function,
neural network structure, and training process is also investigated in depth in
this paper. The excellent performance and robustness of the proposed modulation
scheme are verified by carrying out the bit error rate test over various UWA
channels with severe delay-scale spread.

Abstract: The design of image reconstruction algorithms for near-range handheld
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems has gained increasing popularity due to
the promising performance of portable millimeter-wave (MMW) imaging devices in
various application fields. Time domain imaging algorithms including the
backprojection algorithm (BPA) and the Kirchhoff migration algorithm (KMA) are
widely adopted due to their direct applicability to arbitrary scan
trajectories. However, they suffer from time complexity issues that hinder
their practical application. Wavenumber domain algorithms greatly improve the
computational efficiency but most of them are restricted to specific array
topologies. Based on the factorization techniques as adopted in far-field
synthetic aperture radar imaging, the time domain fast factorized
backprojection algorithm for handheld synthetic aperture radar (HHFFBPA) is
proposed. The local spectral properties of the radar images for handheld
systems are analyzed and analytical spectrum compression techniques are derived
to realize efficient sampling of the subimages. Validated through numerical
simulations and experiments, HHFFBPA achieves fast and accurate 3-D imaging for
handheld synthetic aperture radar systems with arbitrary trajectories.

Abstract: Wireless channel propagation parameter estimation forms the foundation of
channel sounding, estimation, modeling, and sensing. This paper introduces a
Deep Learning approach for joint delay- and Doppler estimation from frequency
and time samples of a radio channel transfer function.
  Our work estimates the two-dimensional path parameters from a channel impulse
response containing an unknown number of paths. Compared to existing deep
learning-based methods, the parameters are not estimated via classification but
in a quasi-grid-free manner. We employ a deterministic preprocessing scheme
that incorporates a multi-channel windowing to increase the estimator's
robustness and enables the use of a CNN architecture. The proposed architecture
then jointly estimates the number of paths along with the respective delay and
Doppler-shift parameters of the paths. Hence, it jointly solves the model order
selection and parameter estimation task. We also integrate the CNN into an
existing maximum-likelihood estimator framework for efficient initialization of
a gradient-based iteration, to provide more accurate estimates.
  In the analysis, we compare our approach to other methods in terms of
estimate accuracy and model order error on synthetic data. Finally, we
demonstrate its applicability to real-world measurement data from a anechoic
bi-static RADAR emulation measurement.

Result: 仿真验证了该方法在提升覆盖区域平均信道增益方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需频繁调整IRS反射系数，显著提升了IRS辅助系统的覆盖性能。

Abstract: By applying tunable phase shifts to incident waves via passive signal
reflection, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can offer significant
performance improvement for wireless communication systems. To reap such
performance gain, channel knowledge for IRS-cascaded links is generally
required, which is practically challenging to acquire due to their
high-dimensional and time-varying characteristics. Conventional pilot-based
channel estimation incurs excessive overhead due to the large number of
reflecting elements, thus undermining the IRS efficiency, especially for
wideband systems with frequency-selective fading channels. To tackle this
issue, we propose in this letter a power-measurement-based channel
autocorrelation matrix estimation and coverage enhancement approach for
IRS-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.
Specifically, by estimating equivalent channel autocorrelation matrices of
IRS-cascaded OFDM channels based on receive signal power and optimizing the IRS
reflection vector based on them, the average coverage performance in the
IRS-aided region is enhanced without the need for frequent reconfiguration of
IRS reflection coefficients based on user instantaneous channels. Simulation
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for improving the
average channel gain over the coverage region.

Conclusion: E-WAN为能量收集网络提供了一种灵活且高效的通信解决方案。

Abstract: The ever-increasing number of distributed embedded systems in the context of
the Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), and
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) rely on wireless communication to collect and
exchange data. Nodes can employ single-hop communication which, despite its
ease, may necessitate energy-intensive long-range communication to cover long
distances. Conversely, multi-hop communication allows for more energy-efficient
short-range communication since nodes can rely on other nodes to forward their
data. Yet, this approach requires relay nodes to be available and continuous
maintenance of a dynamically changing distributed state. At the same time,
energy harvesting has the potential to outperform traditional battery-based
systems by improving their lifetime, scalability with lower maintenance costs,
and environmental impact. However, the limited and temporally and spatially
variable harvested energy poses significant challenges for networking in energy
harvesting networks, particularly considering the energy demands and
characteristics of both multi-hop and single-hop communication. We propose
E-WAN, a protocol for energy harvesting wide-area low-power networks that
builds on the concept of \emph{virtual sub-networks} to enable
resource-efficient multi-hop communication when possible and reliable however
energy-intensive point-to-point communication otherwise. Nodes autonomously and
dynamically move between the two and adjust to changing network states and
resources based only on easily obtainable network state information. We
illustrate E-WAN's advantages both in terms of efficiency and adaptability in
various communication and harvesting scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate
E-WAN operating in a realistic setting by deploying an energy harvesting
network in a real-world indoor environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波/太赫兹频段，当窃听者与合法用户方向一致时，可移动天线阵列的保密性能受限，需要一种新的方法来增强安全性。

Method: 通过联合设计MA和FDA，推导了天线位置和频率偏移的闭式解，并比较了在小扰动假设下与一般约束下的最差保密率。

Result: 仿真结果表明，优化的频率分集MA方法显著提升了在窃听者与合法接收者方向一致时的保密性能。

Conclusion: 联合MA和FDA的设计是一种有效的解决方案，能够显著提升无线通信的保密性能。

Abstract: Movable-antenna (MA) arrays are envisioned as a promising technique for
enhancing secrecy performance in wireless communications by leveraging
additional spatial degrees of freedom. However, when the eavesdropper is
located in the same direction as the legitimate user, particularly in
mmWave/THz bands where line-of-sight (LOS) propagation dominates, the secrecy
performance of MA arrays becomes significantly limited, thus directionally
insecure. To address this challenge, we employ a joint design that combines an
MA array with a frequency-diverse array (FDA) at the transmitter to secure the
transmission across both range and direction. Specifically, we derive
closed-form expressions for the optimal antenna positions and frequency shifts,
assuming small perturbations in both parameters from a linear frequency-diverse
MA configuration. Furthermore, we compare the worst-case secrecy rate under
this minor perturbation assumption with that obtained under a general
constraint, where simulated annealing is employed to numerically determine the
optimal parameters. Simulation results confirm that the proposed optimized
frequency diverse MA approach significantly enhances secrecy performance in the
presence of an eavesdropper aligned with the direction of the legitimate
receiver.

Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have emerged as a promising flexible-antenna
architecture for next-generation wireless networks, enabling enhanced
adaptability and user-centric connectivity through antenna repositioning along
waveguides. However, existing studies often overlook in-waveguide signal
attenuation and in the literature, there is no comprehensive analysis on
whether and under what conditions such an assumption is justified. This paper
addresses this gap by explicitly incorporating in-waveguide attenuation into
both the system model and algorithm design, and studying its impact on the
downlink user data rates. We begin with a single-user scenario and derive a
closed-form expression for the globally optimal antenna placement, which
reveals how the attenuation coefficient and the user-to-waveguide distance
jointly affect the optimal antenna position. Based on this analytical solution,
we further provide a theoretical analysis identifying the system conditions
under which the in-waveguide attenuation has an insignificant impact on the
user achievable rate. The study is then extended to the multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output setting, where two efficient algorithms are
developed, based on the weighted minimum mean square error method and the
maximum ratio combining method, to jointly optimize beamforming and antenna
placement. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms
and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems substantially outperform
conventional fixed-antenna baselines, underscoring their potential for future
flexible wireless communications.

Result: HMM显著提升了AAD算法的性能，在准确性和响应速度上优于现有后处理方法。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效、易于使用，适用于实时和离线场景，为AAD的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit brain signals, such as
electroencephalography (EEG), to identify which speaker a listener is focusing
on in a multi-speaker environment. While state-of-the-art AAD algorithms can
identify the attended speaker on short time windows, their predictions are
often too inaccurate for practical use. In this work, we propose augmenting AAD
with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the temporal structure of
attention. More specifically, the HMM relies on the fact that a subject is much
less likely to switch attention than to keep attending the same speaker at any
moment in time. We show how a HMM can significantly improve existing AAD
algorithms in both causal (real-time) and non-causal (offline) settings. We
further demonstrate that HMMs outperform existing postprocessing approaches in
both accuracy and responsiveness, and explore how various factors such as
window length, switching frequency, and AAD accuracy influence overall
performance. The proposed method is computationally efficient, intuitive to use
and applicable in both real-time and offline settings.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在离线和流式场景下均达到最先进性能，有效处理严重重叠语音。

Conclusion: 该方法为严重重叠语音条件下的多说话人ASR提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a self-speaker adaptation method for streaming multi-talker
automatic speech recognition (ASR) that eliminates the need for explicit
speaker queries. Unlike conventional approaches requiring target speaker
embeddings or enrollment audio, our technique dynamically adapts individual ASR
instances through speaker-wise speech activity prediction. The key innovation
involves injecting speaker-specific kernels generated via speaker supervision
activations into selected ASR encoder layers. This enables instantaneous
speaker adaptation to target speakers while handling fully overlapped speech
even in a streaming scenario. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in
both offline and streaming scenarios, demonstrating that our self-adaptive
method effectively addresses severe speech overlap through streamlined
speaker-focused recognition. The results validate the proposed self-speaker
adaptation approach as a robust solution for multi-talker ASR under severe
overlapping speech conditions.

Abstract: The automatic assessment of health-related acoustic cues has the potential to
improve healthcare accessibility and affordability. Although parametric models
are promising, they face challenges in privacy and adaptability. To address
these, we propose a NoN-Parametric framework for Speech-based symptom
Assessment (NoNPSA). By isolating medical data in a retrieval datastore, NoNPSA
avoids encoding private information in model parameters and enables efficient
data updates. A self-supervised learning (SSL) model pre-trained on
general-purpose datasets extracts features, which are used for similarity-based
retrieval. Metadata-aware refinement filters the retrieved data, and associated
labels are used to compute an assessment score. Experimental results show that
NoNPSA achieves competitive performance compared to fine-tuning SSL-based
methods, while enabling greater privacy, update efficiency, and
adaptability--showcasing the potential of non-parametric approaches in
healthcare.

Motivation: 多音高估计（MPE）在音乐信息检索中至关重要，但现有方法依赖监督学习且标注数据难以获取。自监督方法虽有潜力，但仍不及监督方法。

Method: 扩展经典监督MPE范式，引入基于音高不变性和音高等变性的自监督目标进行联合训练。

Result: 在封闭训练条件下性能显著提升，但发现模型在监督数据上过拟合同时在自监督数据上退化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了结合监督与自监督学习时的潜在问题，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Multi-Pitch Estimation (MPE) continues to be a sought after capability of
Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems, and is critical for many
applications and downstream tasks involving pitch, including music
transcription. However, existing methods are largely based on supervised
learning, and there are significant challenges in collecting annotated data for
the task. Recently, self-supervised techniques exploiting intrinsic properties
of pitch and harmonic signals have shown promise for both monophonic and
polyphonic pitch estimation, but these still remain inferior to supervised
methods. In this work, we extend the classic supervised MPE paradigm by
incorporating several self-supervised objectives based on pitch-invariant and
pitch-equivariant properties. This joint training results in a substantial
improvement under closed training conditions, which naturally suggests that
applying the same objectives to a broader collection of data will yield further
improvements. However, in doing so we uncover a phenomenon whereby our model
simultaneously overfits to the supervised data while degenerating on data used
for self-supervision only. We demonstrate and investigate this and offer our
insights on the underlying problem.

Method: 通过主观评分训练对比语言-音频模型Human-CLAP。

Result: Human-CLAP将SRCC提升超过0.25。

Conclusion: Human-CLAP显著改善了CLAPScore与人类主观评分的一致性。

Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) is widely used for audio
generation and recognition tasks. For example, CLAPScore, which utilizes the
similarity of CLAP embeddings, has been a major metric for the evaluation of
the relevance between audio and text in text-to-audio. However, the
relationship between CLAPScore and human subjective evaluation scores is still
unclarified. We show that CLAPScore has a low correlation with human subjective
evaluation scores. Additionally, we propose a human-perception-based CLAP
called Human-CLAP by training a contrastive language-audio model using the
subjective evaluation score. In our experiments, the results indicate that our
Human-CLAP improved the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) between
the CLAPScore and the subjective evaluation scores by more than 0.25 compared
with the conventional CLAP.

Result: 模型在700小时高质量数据上的表现优于2500小时完整数据集。

Conclusion: 数据质量对语音增强系统的扩展至关重要，应优先于数据量的扩展。

Abstract: The vast majority of modern speech enhancement systems rely on data-driven
neural network models. Conventionally, larger datasets are presumed to yield
superior model performance, an observation empirically validated across
numerous tasks in other domains. However, recent studies reveal diminishing
returns when scaling speech enhancement data. We focus on a critical factor:
prevalent quality issues in ``clean'' training labels within large-scale
datasets. This work re-examines this phenomenon and demonstrates that, within
large-scale training sets, prioritizing high-quality training data is more
important than merely expanding the data volume. Experimental findings suggest
that models trained on a carefully curated subset of 700 hours can outperform
models trained on the 2,500-hour full dataset. This outcome highlights the
crucial role of data curation in scaling speech enhancement systems
effectively.

Result: 在多个公开测试集上，URGENT-PK在系统级排名性能上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: URGENT-PK通过简单网络架构和有限数据实现了高效排名，为语音质量评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is fundamental to speech quality assessment.
However, its acquisition requires significant human annotation. Although deep
neural network approaches, such as DNSMOS and UTMOS, have been developed to
predict MOS to avoid this issue, they often suffer from insufficient training
data. Recognizing that the comparison of speech enhancement (SE) systems
prioritizes a reliable system comparison over absolute scores, we propose
URGENT-PK, a novel ranking approach leveraging pairwise comparisons. URGENT-PK
takes homologous enhanced speech pairs as input to predict relative quality
rankings. This pairwise paradigm efficiently utilizes limited training data, as
all pairwise permutations of multiple systems constitute a training instance.
Experiments across multiple open test sets demonstrate URGENT-PK's superior
system-level ranking performance over state-of-the-art baselines, despite its
simple network architecture and limited training data.

Method: 采用可微分迭代声音匹配方法，结合四种损失函数与三种合成器，进行300次随机声音匹配试验。

Result: 结果表明损失函数性能因合成器而异，三种性能指标间一致性中等。

Conclusion: 结论指出应针对特定合成技术开发定制化相似性度量，而非追求通用解决方案。

Abstract: Manual sound design with a synthesizer is inherently iterative: an artist
compares the synthesized output to a mental target, adjusts parameters, and
repeats until satisfied. Iterative sound-matching automates this workflow by
continually programming a synthesizer under the guidance of a loss function (or
similarity measure) toward a target sound. Prior comparisons of loss functions
have typically favored one metric over another, but only within narrow
settings: limited synthesis methods, few loss types, often without blind
listening tests. This leaves open the question of whether a universally optimal
loss exists, or the choice of loss remains a creative decision conditioned on
the synthesis method and the sound designer's preference. We propose
differentiable iterative sound-matching as the natural extension of the
available literature, since it combines the manual approach to sound design
with modern advances in machine learning. To analyze the variability of loss
function performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel
and established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with
differentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers. For each of the
sixteen synthesizer--loss combinations, we ran 300 randomized sound-matching
trials. Performance was measured using parameter differences,
spectrogram-distance metrics, and manually assigned listening scores. We
observed a moderate level of consistency among the three performance measures.
Our post-hoc analysis shows that the loss function performance is highly
dependent on the synthesizer. These findings underscore the value of expanding
the scope of sound-matching experiments and developing new similarity metrics
tailored to specific synthesis techniques rather than pursuing
one-size-fits-all solutions.

Result: 自监督的三元组损失表现最佳，且在多个正样本训练时对不同损失函数有显著不同效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在合成和真实数据集上均达到最优性能。

Abstract: Audio fingerprinting (AFP) allows the identification of unknown audio content
by extracting compact representations, termed audio fingerprints, that are
designed to remain robust against common audio degradations. Neural AFP methods
often employ metric learning, where representation quality is influenced by the
nature of the supervision and the utilized loss function. However, recent work
unrealistically simulates real-life audio degradation during training,
resulting in sub-optimal supervision. Additionally, although several modern
metric learning approaches have been proposed, current neural AFP methods
continue to rely on the NT-Xent loss without exploring the recent advances or
classical alternatives. In this work, we propose a series of best practices to
enhance the self-supervision by leveraging musical signal properties and
realistic room acoustics. We then present the first systematic evaluation of
various metric learning approaches in the context of AFP, demonstrating that a
self-supervised adaptation of the triplet loss yields superior performance. Our
results also reveal that training with multiple positive samples per anchor has
critically different effects across loss functions. Our approach is built upon
these insights and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both a large,
synthetically degraded dataset and a real-world dataset recorded using
microphones in diverse music venues.

Abstract: Speech embeddings often retain sensitive attributes such as speaker identity,
accent, or demographic information, posing risks in biased model training and
privacy leakage. We propose WavShape, an information-theoretic speech
representation learning framework that optimizes embeddings for fairness and
privacy while preserving task-relevant information. We leverage mutual
information (MI) estimation using the Donsker-Varadhan formulation to guide an
MI-based encoder that systematically filters sensitive attributes while
maintaining speech content essential for downstream tasks. Experimental results
on three known datasets show that WavShape reduces MI between embeddings and
sensitive attributes by up to 81% while retaining 97% of task-relevant
information. By integrating information theory with self-supervised speech
models, this work advances the development of fair, privacy-aware, and
resource-efficient speech systems.

Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition (DSR) enhances the accessibility of smart
devices for dysarthric speakers with limited mobility. Previously, DSR research
was constrained by the fact that existing datasets typically consisted of
isolated words, command phrases, and a limited number of sentences spoken by a
few individuals. This constrained research to command-interaction systems and
speaker adaptation. The Speech Accessibility Project (SAP) changed this by
releasing a large and diverse English dysarthric dataset, leading to the SAP
Challenge to build speaker- and text-independent DSR systems. We enhanced the
Whisper model's performance on long dysarthric speech via a novel self-training
method. This method increased training data and adapted the model to handle
potentially incomplete speech segments encountered during inference. Our system
achieved second place in both Word Error Rate and Semantic Score in the SAP

Abstract: Hierarchical planning is a powerful approach to model long sequences
structurally. Aside from considering hierarchies in the temporal structure of
music, this paper explores an even more important aspect: concept hierarchy,
which involves generating music ideas, transforming them, and ultimately
organizing them--across musical time and space--into a complete composition. To
this end, we introduce TOMI (Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas) as a
novel approach in deep music generation and develop a TOMI-based model via
instruction-tuned foundation LLM. Formally, we represent a multi-track
composition process via a sparse, four-dimensional space characterized by clips
(short audio or MIDI segments), sections (temporal positions), tracks
(instrument layers), and transformations (elaboration methods). Our model is
capable of generating multi-track electronic music with full-song structure,
and we further integrate the TOMI-based model with the REAPER digital audio
workstation, enabling interactive human-AI co-creation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach produces higher-quality electronic music with
stronger structural coherence compared to baselines.

Abstract: Florence B. Price was a composer in the early 20th century whose music
reflects her upbringing in the American South, her African heritage, and her
Western classical training. She is noted as the first African-American woman to
have a symphony performed by a major orchestra. Her music has recently received
renewed attention from both the public and the research community, decades
after her death. In addition to other genres, Price was a prolific composer for
solo voice and piano. Music historians have documented the existence of 134 art
songs and piano/voice arrangements for spirituals and folk songs written by
Price. We release a digital catalog of 112 of these works in MuseScore,
MusicXML, MIDI, and PDF format. We also use this dataset to fine-tune a
symbolic music generation model to generate accompaniments to melodies, and we
conduct a blind listening experiment that shows that accompaniments generated
by our model are perceived as being reflective of Florence Price's style more
frequently than accompaniments generated by a baseline model. We release our
model as the Florence Price Piano Accompaniment Generator alongside our
dataset.

TL;DR: XY-Tokenizer是一种新型语音编解码器，通过多阶段多任务学习平衡语义丰富性和声学保真度，性能优于现有编解码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音编解码器难以同时满足高质量音频重建和语言模型易建模的需求，需要一种新的解决方案。

Method: 提出XY-Tokenizer，采用多阶段多任务学习方法，兼顾语义和声学能力。

Result: XY-Tokenizer在语义和声学任务上表现优异，文本对齐能力超越SpeechTokenizer和Mimi，声学重建性能接近BigCodec。

Conclusion: XY-Tokenizer成功解决了语义与声学能力的冲突，为语音语言模型提供了更优的编解码方案。

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language
models. An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve
acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However,
existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction
with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the
limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic
fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict
between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task
learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves
performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of
state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those
existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer
achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling
methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker
similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The
reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec,
the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a
speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate. Code and models are
available at https://github.com/gyt1145028706/XY-Tokenizer.

### [61] [You Sound a Little Tense: L2 Tailored Clear TTS Using Durational Vowel Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23367)
*Paige Tuttösí,H. Henny Yeung,Yue Wang,Jean-Julien Aucouturier,Angelica Lim*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对第二语言（L2）学习者的文本转语音（TTS）系统，通过调整元音时长差异提升清晰度，实验表明其效果优于整体语速减慢，但听众对此无感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为L2学习者提供更清晰的语音输出，解决传统TTS系统在L2学习者中的不足。

Method: 利用美国英语中紧元音和松元音的时长差异，设计了一种“清晰模式”。

Result: 法语母语的英语L2学习者在清晰模式下转录错误减少至少9.15%，且认为该模式更鼓舞人心和尊重人。

Conclusion: 实际清晰度与感知清晰度不相关，且现有ASR系统（如Whisper）无法准确评估L2学习者的语音理解效果。

Abstract: We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language
(L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense
(longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS.
Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer
(at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it
more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably,
listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error
rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words
was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not
correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that
Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult
vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for
these individuals.

Method: 基于PANNs框架开发了轻量级卷积神经网络E2PANNs，利用专用数据集AudioSet EV进行微调和评估，并在嵌入式硬件上测试实时性能。

Result: E2PANNs在紧急车辆警笛检测领域达到了新的最高水平，具有高计算效率和边缘设备适用性。

Conclusion: E2PANNs为紧急车辆警笛检测提供了一种高效、轻量级的解决方案，适用于边缘计算和关键安全应用。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of Emergency Vehicle (EV) sirens is critical for the
integration of intelligent transportation systems, smart city monitoring
systems, and autonomous driving technologies. Modern automatic solutions are
limited by the lack of large scale, curated datasets and by the computational
demands of state of the art sound event detection models. This work introduces
E2PANNs (Efficient Emergency Pre trained Audio Neural Networks), a lightweight
Convolutional Neural Network architecture derived from the PANNs framework,
specifically optimized for binary EV siren detection. Leveraging our dedicated
subset of AudioSet (AudioSet EV) we fine-tune and evaluate E2PANNs across
multiple reference datasets and test its viability on embedded hardware. The
experimental campaign includes ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and
real-time inference deployment on edge device. Interpretability analyses
exploiting Guided Backpropagation and ScoreCAM algorithms provide insights into
the model internal representations and validate its ability to capture distinct
spectrotemporal patterns associated with different types of EV sirens. Real
time performance is assessed through frame wise and event based detection
metrics, as well as a detailed analysis of false positive activations. Results
demonstrate that E2PANNs establish a new state of the art in this research
domain, with high computational efficiency, and suitability for edge-based
audio monitoring and safety-critical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主观评估成本高，客观评估与主观评分相关性不明确，需更高效且准确的评估方法。

Method: 构建RELATE数据集进行主观评估，并开发模型自动预测主观评分。

Result: 新模型在多个声音类别中优于传统CLAPScore模型。

Conclusion: RELATE数据集和新模型为文本到音频相关性评估提供了更高效和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: In text-to-audio (TTA) research, the relevance between input text and output
audio is an important evaluation aspect. Traditionally, it has been evaluated
from both subjective and objective perspectives. However, subjective evaluation
is costly in terms of money and time, and objective evaluation is unclear
regarding the correlation to subjective evaluation scores. In this study, we
construct RELATE, an open-sourced dataset that subjectively evaluates the
relevance. Also, we benchmark a model for automatically predicting the
subjective evaluation score from synthesized audio. Our model outperforms a
conventional CLAPScore model, and that trend extends to many sound categories.

Motivation: 当前语音语言模型在部署环境中存在规模和延迟限制，需要更紧凑的模型。

Method: 采用层对齐蒸馏技术，匹配隐藏状态、注意力图和软化logits，训练2B参数的TinyWave模型。

Result: TinyWave在Libri-Light上接近教师模型性能，在StoryCloze和SALMon任务上达到93-97%的准确率。

Conclusion: TinyWave适用于实时对话代理和低资源环境，模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of
many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation
models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention
maps, and softened logits to compress large multimodal transformers by 3x with
minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter
models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on
50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation
using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations.
Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity
points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97%
of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These
models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling
applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and
low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation
scripts to support reproducible research on compact, expressive speech
generation.

Motivation: 探索生成式自回归Transformer模型在符号音乐生成和分类任务中的潜力，利用大规模数据提升模型性能。

Method: 预训练60,000小时音乐数据，微调高质量子集，生成音乐延续、分类任务及MIDI嵌入。

Result: 生成模型在钢琴延续连贯性上优于其他符号生成技术，对比模型在分类任务中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 模型在音乐生成和分类任务中表现优异，预训练表征具有通用性，适用于下游任务。

Abstract: We study the capabilities of generative autoregressive transformer models
trained on large amounts of symbolic solo-piano transcriptions. After first
pretraining on approximately 60,000 hours of music, we use a comparatively
smaller, high-quality subset, to finetune models to produce musical
continuations, perform symbolic classification tasks, and produce
general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to
symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative
model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains
competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification
benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve
state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning
demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often
requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream
tasks.

TL;DR: 论文挑战了对比自监督学习（SSL）在局部音乐信息检索（MIR）任务中表现不佳的假设，展示了结合Transformer的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对比SSL在局部MIR任务中的表现，揭示其被忽视的能力。

Method: 使用轻量级ViT-1D模型和NT-Xent损失进行对比训练。

Result: 序列令牌在局部任务中表现优异，且不同层捕捉不同音乐特征。

Conclusion: 对比SSL结合Transformer在MIR中具有潜力，且序列令牌隐含丰富音乐信息。

Abstract: In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning
for general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as
automatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is
widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised
models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g.,
masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the
potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We
consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the
time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL
through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although
NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks
to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence
tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens
offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful
properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform
unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore,
high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention
maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different
musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but
advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some
overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence
modeling in MIR.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: StreamFlow是一种新型神经架构，通过扩散变换器（DiT）实现流式流匹配，解决了传统方法在流式语音生成中的音频质量下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖全局感受野，难以实现流式生成，且直接逐令牌生成会导致音频质量下降。

Method: 设计局部块级感受野策略，将序列分段并引入块级注意力掩码，结合分层DiT块调节感受野。

Result: 在语音质量和推理时间上优于其他流式方法，首次包延迟仅180毫秒。

Conclusion: StreamFlow在流式语音生成中表现出色，性能接近非流式方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in discrete token-based speech generation have
highlighted the importance of token-to-waveform generation for audio quality,
particularly in real-time interactions. Traditional frameworks integrating
semantic tokens with flow matching (FM) struggle with streaming capabilities
due to their reliance on a global receptive field. Additionally, directly
implementing token-by-token streaming speech generation often results in
degraded audio quality. To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a
novel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with
diffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation
issues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local
block-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first
segmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable
the current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block.
These attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks
to regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective
experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance
comparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in
terms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time
during long-sequence generation. Furthermore, our method achieves a notable
first-packet latency of only 180 ms.\footnote{Speech samples:

Zaiane"], "title": "Evaluating Sound Similarity Metrics for Differentiable, Iterative Sound-Matching", "comment": null, "summary": "Manual sound design with a synthesizer is inherently iterative: an artist\ncompares the synthesized output to a mental target, adjusts parameters, and\nrepeats until satisfied. Iterative sound-matching automates this workflow by\ncontinually programming a synthesizer under the guidance of a loss function (or\nsimilarity measure) toward a target sound. Prior comparisons of loss functions\nhave typically favored one metric over another, but only within narrow\nsettings: limited synthesis methods, few loss types, often without blind\nlistening tests. This leaves open the question of whether a universally optimal\nloss exists, or the choice of loss remains a creative decision conditioned on\nthe synthesis method and the sound designer's preference. We propose\ndifferentiable iterative sound-matching as the natural extension of the\navailable literature, since it combines the manual approach to sound design\nwith modern advances in machine learning. To analyze the variability of loss\nfunction performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel\nand established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with\ndifferentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers. For each of the\nsixteen synthesizer--loss combinations, we ran 300 randomized sound-matching\ntrials.

However, existing ISAC paradigms rely solely on radio frequency (RF)\nsignal, limiting sensing resolution and robustness in V2X environments with\nhigh mobility and multipath interference. Fortunately, the widespread\ndeployment of diverse non-RF sensors such as cameras and LiDAR, along with the\nintegration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication systems, offers\nnew opportunities to improve the synergy between sensing and communication.\nMotivated by this, this work develops a novel and robust communication\nframework that leverages multi-modal sensing data and advanced AI technologies\nto assist beamforming in dynamic and realistic vehicular scenarios.\nSpecifically, we propose a multi-modal learning framework for predictive\nbeamforming that integrates modality-specific branches and employs hierarchical\nTransformer to capture cross-modal features. By exploiting the intrinsic\ncorrelation between multi-modal sensing data and beamforming decisions, this\ndesign enhances the accuracy and robustness of beamforming in dynamic V2X\nscenarios. To enable practical deployment on resource-constrained edge device\n(i.e., the roadside unit), we then develop a module-aware compression strategy\nthat significantly reduces inference latency while preserving model\nperformance. Furthermore, to address potential modality missing in real-world\nscenarios, we introduce a generative model that is able to reconstruct missing\ninputs from available observations, allowing the framework to operate reliably\neven under incomplete sensing conditions.

The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the\ncoordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via\ntreating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate\ndomain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and\ntrack the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication\nreceiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and\nLoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath\nchannel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain\n(B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a\npriori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated\nto establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on\nthe angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cram\\'er-Rao\nBound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and\npropose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to\nminimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking\naccuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance.

While significant research has\nfocused on secure communications, particularly in ensuring physical layer\nsecurity, the issue of sensing security has received comparatively less\nattention. This paper addresses the sensing security problem in ISAC,\nparticularly under the threat of multi-intercept adversaries. We consider a\nrealistic scenario in which the sensing target is an advanced electronic\nreconnaissance aircraft capable of employing multiple signal interception\ntechniques, such as power detection (PD) and cyclostationary analysis (CA). To\nevaluate sensing security under such sophisticated threats, we analyze two\ncritical features of the transmitted signal: (i) power distribution and (ii)\ncyclic spectrum. Further, we introduce a novel ergodic cyclic spectrum metric\nwhich leverages the intrinsic mathematical structure of cyclostationary signals\nto more comprehensively characterize their behavior. Building on this analysis,\nwe formulate a new ISAC design problem that explicitly considers sensing\nsecurity, and we develop a low-complexity, efficient optimization approach to\nsolve it.

We propose sensing for free - performing multi-source localization\nwithout pilots by reusing uplink data symbols, making sensing occur during\ntransmission and directly compatible with 3GPP 5G NR and 6G specifications.\nWith ever-increasing devices in dense 6G networks, this approach is\nparticularly compelling when combined with sparse arrays, which can localize\nmore sources than uniform arrays via an enlarged virtual array. Existing\npilot-free multi-source localization algorithms first reconstruct an extended\ncovariance matrix and apply subspace methods, incurring cubic complexity and\nlimited to second-order statistics. Performance degrades under non-Gaussian\ndata symbols and few snapshots, and higher-order statistics remain unexploited.\nWe address these challenges with an attention-only transformer that directly\nprocesses raw signal snapshots for grid-less end-to-end direction-of-arrival\n(DOA) estimation. The model efficiently captures higher-order statistics while\nbeing permutation-invariant and adaptive to varying snapshot counts.

Nodes can employ single-hop communication which, despite its\nease, may necessitate energy-intensive long-range communication to cover long\ndistances. Conversely, multi-hop communication allows for more energy-efficient\nshort-range communication since nodes can rely on other nodes to forward their\ndata. Yet, this approach requires relay nodes to be available and continuous\nmaintenance of a dynamically changing distributed state. At the same time,\nenergy harvesting has the potential to outperform traditional battery-based\nsystems by improving their lifetime, scalability with lower maintenance costs,\nand environmental impact. However, the limited and temporally and spatially\nvariable harvested energy poses significant challenges for networking in energy\nharvesting networks, particularly considering the energy demands and\ncharacteristics of both multi-hop and single-hop communication. We propose\nE-WAN, a protocol for energy harvesting wide-area low-power networks that\nbuilds on the concept of \\emph{virtual sub-networks} to enable\nresource-efficient multi-hop communication when possible and reliable however\nenergy-intensive point-to-point communication otherwise. Nodes autonomously and\ndynamically move between the two and adjust to changing network states and\nresources based only on easily obtainable network state information. We\nillustrate E-WAN's advantages both in terms of efficiency and adaptability in\nvarious communication and harvesting scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nE-WAN operating in a realistic setting by deploying an energy harvesting\nnetwork in a real-world indoor environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "E-WAN\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u8df3\u901a\u4fe1\u6216\u53ef\u9760\u5355\u8df3\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u3001\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faE-WAN\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u865a\u62df\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u591a\u8df3\u548c\u5355\u8df3\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "E-WAN\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "E-WAN\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While state-of-the-art AAD algorithms can\nidentify the attended speaker on short time windows, their predictions are\noften too inaccurate for practical use. In this work, we propose augmenting AAD\nwith a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the temporal structure of\nattention. More specifically, the HMM relies on the fact that a subject is much\nless likely to switch attention than to keep attending the same speaker at any\nmoment in time. We show how a HMM can significantly improve existing AAD\nalgorithms in both causal (real-time) and non-causal (offline) settings. We\nfurther demonstrate that HMMs outperform existing postprocessing approaches in\nboth accuracy and responsiveness, and explore how various factors such as\nwindow length, switching frequency, and AAD accuracy influence overall\nperformance. The proposed method is computationally efficient, intuitive to use\nand applicable in both real-time and offline settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff08HMM\uff09\u7684\u542c\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u7801\uff08AAD\uff09\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AAD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u542c\u4f17\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u65f6\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165HMM\u5efa\u6a21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5207\u6362\u6982\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbAAD\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "HMM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AAD\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3aAAD\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

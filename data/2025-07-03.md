Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了在近场区域运行的极大孔径阵列的空间自由度（DoF），探讨了在距离域中空间复用的最大自由度，并给出了闭式解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统远场系统无法在相同角度方向上同时服务多个用户，而近场区域的空间资源可以解决这一问题。研究旨在确定距离域中空间复用的最大自由度。

Method: 通过分析二维发射孔径与线性接收阵列之间的视距（LoS）信道，假设为连续孔径阵列，推导了空间自由度的闭式表达式，并扩展到非正侧配置和模块化阵列。

Result: 研究表明，距离域的空间自由度主要由阵列的极端边界决定，而非其内部结构。模块化阵列在物理长度限制下比单块阵列具有更高的自由度增益。

Conclusion: 论文为近场区域的空间复用提供了理论框架，证明了阵列边界对自由度的主导作用，并展示了模块化阵列的优势。

Abstract: Extremely large aperture array operating in the near-field regime unlocks
additional spatial resources that can be exploited to simultaneously serve
multiple users even when they share the same angular direction, a capability
not achievable in conventional far-field systems. A fundamental question,
however, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of
spatial multiplexing in the distance domain?
  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF
of a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit
aperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at
the same angular direction) but located at different distances from the
transmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are
continuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and
infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees
of freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case
where the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad
side of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral
operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form
expression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows
that the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the
extreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We
further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a
projection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent
broadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular
array, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the
constraint of the physical length of the array.

Abstract: In several applications, one must estimate a real-valued (symmetric) Toeplitz
covariance matrix, typically shifted by the conjugated diagonal matrices of
phase progression and phase "calibration" errors. Unlike the Hermitian Toeplitz
covariance matrices, these symmetric matrices have a unique potential
capability of being estimated regardless of these beam-steering phase
progression and/or phase "calibration" errors. This unique capability is the
primary motivation of this paper.

bound of $N=2K$ is shown to be tight by providing diverse problem instances for
which the proposed algorithm succeeds to identify the parameters. The
advantageous performance of the proposed algorithm is also demonstrated
compared with the state of the art.

Abstract: This paper investigates the system design and experimental validation of

expected to be a critical enabler for next-generation wireless networks. We
advocate exploiting orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation for its
inherent sparsity and stability in delay-Doppler (DD) domain channels,
facilitating a low-overhead environment sensing design. Moreover, a
comprehensive environmental sensing framework is developed, encompassing DD
domain channel estimation, target localization, and experimental validation. In
particular, we first explore the OTFS channel estimation in the presence of
fractional delay and Doppler shifts. Given the estimated parameters, we propose
a three-ellipse positioning algorithm to localize the target's position,
followed by determining the mobile transmitter's velocity. Additionally, to
evaluate the performance of our proposed design, we conduct extensive
simulations and experiments using a software-defined radio (SDR)-based platform
with universal software radio peripheral (USRP). The experimental validations
demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmarks in terms of
localization accuracy and velocity estimation, confirming its effectiveness in
practical environmental sensing applications.

Abstract: Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) combined with orthogonal time
frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising technique for
high-mobility scenarios. However, its performance could be severely degraded
due to channel aging caused by user mobility and high processing latency. In
this paper, an integrated scheme of uplink (UL) channel estimation and downlink
(DL) channel prediction is proposed to alleviate channel aging in time division
duplex (TDD) massive MIMO-OTFS systems. Specifically, first, an iterative basis
expansion model (BEM) based UL channel estimation scheme is proposed to
accurately estimate UL channels with the aid of carefully designed OTFS frame
pattern. Then a set of Slepian sequences are used to model the estimated UL
channels, and the dynamic Slepian coefficients are fitted by a set of
orthogonal polynomials. A channel predictor is derived to predict DL channels
by iteratively extrapolating the Slepian coefficients. Simulation results
verify that the proposed UL channel estimation and DL channel prediction
schemes outperform the existing schemes in terms of normalized mean square
error of channel estimation/prediction and DL spectral efficiency, with less
pilot overhead.

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial in industrial environments. Visible
Light Communication (VLC) has emerged as a promising solution, offering high
accuracy, energy efficiency, and minimal electromagnetic interference. However,
VLC-based indoor localization faces challenges due to environmental
variability, such as lighting fluctuations and obstacles. To address these
challenges, we propose a Transfer Learning (TL)-based approach for VLC-based
indoor localization. Using real-world data collected at a BOSCH factory, the TL
framework integrates a deep neural network (DNN) to improve localization
accuracy by 47\%, reduce energy consumption by 32\%, and decrease computational
time by 40\% compared to the conventional models. The proposed solution is
highly adaptable under varying environmental conditions and achieves similar
accuracy with only 30\% of the dataset, making it a cost-efficient and scalable
option for industrial applications in Industry 4.0.

### [7] [Frequency-switching Array Enhanced Physical-Layer Security in Terahertz Bands: A Movable Antenna Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01624)
*Cong Zhou,Changsheng You,Shuo Shi,Weidong Mei*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频率切换阵列（FSA）的太赫兹频段物理层安全系统，通过灵活切换载波频率和小频率偏移消除窃听。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统移动天线（MAs）在硬件和信号处理上的限制，如定位精度低、延迟高和成本高，同时提升物理层安全性能。

Method: 通过控制载波频率参数形成稀疏阵列，结合最大比率传输（MRT）波束成形和块坐标下降（BCD）与投影梯度上升（PGA）算法优化。

Result: FSA能在角度和距离域灵活实现零陷，显著提升保密率性能，优于固定位置阵列（FPAs）。

Conclusion: FSA系统在太赫兹频段具有硬件友好性和高安全性，为物理层安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new frequency-switching array (FSA) enhanced
physical-layer security (PLS) system in terahertz bands, where the carrier
frequency can be flexibly switched and small frequency offsets can be imposed
on each antenna at Alice, so as to eliminate information wiretapping by
undesired eavesdroppers. First, we analytically show that by flexibly
controlling the carrier frequency parameters, FSAs can effectively form
uniform/non-uniform sparse arrays, hence resembling movable antennas (MAs) in
the control of inter-antenna spacing and providing additional degree-of-freedom
(DoF) in the beam control. Although the proposed FSA experiences additional
path-gain attenuation in the received signals, it can overcome several hardware
and signal processing issues incurred by MAs, such as limited positioning
accuracy, considerable response latency, and demanding hardware and energy
cost. To shed useful insights, we first consider a secrecy-guaranteed problem
with a null-steering constraint for which maximum ratio transmission (MRT)
beamformer is considered at Alice and the frequency offsets are set as uniform
frequency increment. Interestingly, it is shown that the proposed FSA can
flexibly realize null-steering over Eve in both the angular domain (by tuning
carrier frequency) and range domain (by controlling per-antenna frequency
offset), thereby achieving improved PLS performance. Then, for the general
case, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex
problem by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) and projected gradient
ascent (PGA) techniques. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the convergence
of the proposed optimization algorithm and its superiority over fixed-position
arrays (FPAs) in terms of secrecy-rate performance.

Result: 仿真结果表明，UniToCom在动态信道条件下优于基线方法，提升了通信效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: UniToCom为下一代智能通信提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案，支持多模态理解和生成。

Abstract: This letter proposes UniToCom, a unified token communication paradigm that
treats tokens as the fundamental units for both processing and wireless
transmission. Specifically, to enable efficient token representations, we
propose a generative information bottleneck (GenIB) principle, which
facilitates the learning of tokens that preserve essential information while
supporting reliable generation across multiple modalities. By doing this,
GenIB-based tokenization is conducive to improving the communication efficiency
and reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$-GenIB
to address the challenges of variance collapse in autoregressive modeling,
maintaining representational diversity and stability. Moreover, we employ a
causal Transformer-based multimodal large language model (MLLM) at the receiver
to unify the processing of both discrete and continuous tokens under the
next-token prediction paradigm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
and superiority of the proposed UniToCom compared to baselines under dynamic
channel conditions. By integrating token processing with MLLMs, UniToCom
enables scalable and generalizable communication in favor of multimodal
understanding and generation, providing a potential solution for
next-generation intelligent communications.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a core technology for future
wireless networks, enabling high-resolution sensing and reliable data
transmission within a unified radio platform. This paper develops a theoretical
framework to assess the estimation accuracy of target position and velocity in
heterogeneous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC
networks with multiple cooperative and distributed multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) base stations (BSs). Using Fisher information analysis,
we first derive closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for target
localization in single monostatic and bistatic configurations. We then analyze
the benefits of BS cooperation by deriving CRLBs for joint position and
velocity estimation in a general setting that encompasses multiple cooperating
monostatic systems and multistatic networks with multiple transmitters (Txs)
and receivers (Rxs). The influence of key system parameters, including the
number of BSs, bandwidth, antenna array configuration, and network geometry, is
systematically examined. Numerical results highlight the performance gains
enabled by cooperative sensing and provide insights to guide the design of
future ISAC systems.

Abstract: Accurate propagation of orbital uncertainty is essential for a range of
applications within space domain awareness. Adaptive Gaussian mixture-based
approaches offer tractable nonlinear uncertainty propagation through splitting
mixands to increase resolution in areas of stronger nonlinearities, as well as
by reducing mixands to prevent unnecessary computational effort. Recent work
introduced principled heuristics that incorporate information from the system
dynamics and initial uncertainty to determine optimal directions for splitting.
This paper develops adaptive uncertainty propagation methods based on these
robust splitting techniques. A deferred splitting algorithm tightly integrated
with higher-order splitting techniques is proposed and shown to offer
substantial gains in computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
Second-order propagation of mixand moments is also seen to improve accuracy
while retaining significant computational savings from deferred splitting.
Different immediate and deferred splitting methods are compared in three
representative test cases, including a geostationary orbit, a Molniya orbit,
and a periodic three-body orbit.

Conclusion: CNN方法在无线传感中具有实际应用潜力，尤其在复杂传播场景下。

Abstract: In wireless sensing applications, such as ISAC, one of the first crucial
signal processing steps is the detection and estimation targets from a channel
estimate. Effective algorithms in this context must be robust across a broad
SNR range, capable of handling an unknown number of targets, and
computationally efficient for real-time implementation. During the last decade,
different Machine Learning methods have emerged as promising solutions, either
as standalone models or as complementing existing techniques. However, since
models are often trained and evaluated on synthetic data from existing models,
applying them to measurement is challenging. All the while, training directly
on measurement data is prohibitive in complex propagation scenarios as a
groundtruth is not available. Therefore, in this paper, we train a CNN approach
for target detection and estimation on synthetic data and evaluate it on
measurement data from a suburban outdoor measurement. Using knowledge of the
environment as well as available groundtruth positions, we study the detection
probability and accuracy of our approach. The results demonstrate that our
approach works on measurement data and is suitable for joint detection and
estimation of sensing targets in ISAC systems.

expansion model (BEM) based UL channel estimation scheme is proposed to
accurately estimate UL channels with the aid of carefully designed OTFS frame
pattern. Then a set of Slepian sequences are used to model the estimated UL
channels, and the dynamic Slepian coefficients are fitted by a set of
orthogonal polynomials. A channel predictor is derived to predict DL channels
by iteratively extrapolating the Slepian coefficients. Simulation results
verify that the proposed UL channel estimation and DL channel prediction
schemes outperform the existing schemes in terms of normalized mean square
error of channel estimation/prediction and DL spectral efficiency, with less
pilot overhead.

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial in industrial environments. Visible
Light Communication (VLC) has emerged as a promising solution, offering high
accuracy, energy efficiency, and minimal electromagnetic interference. However,
VLC-based indoor localization faces challenges due to environmental
variability, such as lighting fluctuations and obstacles. To address these
challenges, we propose a Transfer Learning (TL)-based approach for VLC-based
indoor localization. Using real-world data collected at a BOSCH factory, the TL
framework integrates a deep neural network (DNN) to improve localization
accuracy by 47\%, reduce energy consumption by 32\%, and decrease computational
time by 40\% compared to the conventional models. The proposed solution is
highly adaptable under varying environmental conditions and achieves similar
accuracy with only 30\% of the dataset, making it a cost-efficient and scalable
option for industrial applications in Industry 4.0.

*Cong Zhou,Changsheng You,Shuo Shi,Weidong Mei*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种新型频率切换阵列（FSA）增强的物理层安全（PLS）系统，通过灵活切换载波频率和小频率偏移，防止窃听。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统移动天线（MAs）在硬件和信号处理上的问题，如定位精度低、延迟高和成本高。

Method: 利用FSA形成稀疏阵列，控制载波频率和频率偏移，实现角度和距离域的空域控制。

Result: FSA在安全速率性能上优于固定位置阵列（FPAs），并能灵活实现空域控制。

Conclusion: FSA是一种高效且灵活的PLS解决方案，克服了MAs的硬件限制。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new frequency-switching array (FSA) enhanced
physical-layer security (PLS) system in terahertz bands, where the carrier
frequency can be flexibly switched and small frequency offsets can be imposed
on each antenna at Alice, so as to eliminate information wiretapping by
undesired eavesdroppers. First, we analytically show that by flexibly
controlling the carrier frequency parameters, FSAs can effectively form
uniform/non-uniform sparse arrays, hence resembling movable antennas (MAs) in
the control of inter-antenna spacing and providing additional degree-of-freedom
(DoF) in the beam control. Although the proposed FSA experiences additional
path-gain attenuation in the received signals, it can overcome several hardware
and signal processing issues incurred by MAs, such as limited positioning
accuracy, considerable response latency, and demanding hardware and energy
cost. To shed useful insights, we first consider a secrecy-guaranteed problem
with a null-steering constraint for which maximum ratio transmission (MRT)
beamformer is considered at Alice and the frequency offsets are set as uniform
frequency increment. Interestingly, it is shown that the proposed FSA can
flexibly realize null-steering over Eve in both the angular domain (by tuning
carrier frequency) and range domain (by controlling per-antenna frequency
offset), thereby achieving improved PLS performance. Then, for the general
case, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex
problem by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) and projected gradient
ascent (PGA) techniques. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the convergence
of the proposed optimization algorithm and its superiority over fixed-position
arrays (FPAs) in terms of secrecy-rate performance.

Motivation: 解决多模态通信中令牌表示和传输的效率与可靠性问题，为下一代智能通信提供可扩展和通用的解决方案。

Conclusion: UniToCom通过集成令牌处理和MLLM，支持多模态理解与生成，为下一代智能通信提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: This letter proposes UniToCom, a unified token communication paradigm that
treats tokens as the fundamental units for both processing and wireless
transmission. Specifically, to enable efficient token representations, we
propose a generative information bottleneck (GenIB) principle, which
facilitates the learning of tokens that preserve essential information while
supporting reliable generation across multiple modalities. By doing this,
GenIB-based tokenization is conducive to improving the communication efficiency
and reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$-GenIB
to address the challenges of variance collapse in autoregressive modeling,
maintaining representational diversity and stability. Moreover, we employ a
causal Transformer-based multimodal large language model (MLLM) at the receiver
to unify the processing of both discrete and continuous tokens under the
next-token prediction paradigm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
and superiority of the proposed UniToCom compared to baselines under dynamic
channel conditions. By integrating token processing with MLLMs, UniToCom
enables scalable and generalizable communication in favor of multimodal
understanding and generation, providing a potential solution for
next-generation intelligent communications.

Conclusion: 多基站协作能显著提升ISAC网络的感知性能，系统参数如带宽、天线配置和网络几何对性能有重要影响。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a core technology for future
wireless networks, enabling high-resolution sensing and reliable data
transmission within a unified radio platform. This paper develops a theoretical
framework to assess the estimation accuracy of target position and velocity in
heterogeneous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC
networks with multiple cooperative and distributed multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) base stations (BSs). Using Fisher information analysis,
we first derive closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for target
localization in single monostatic and bistatic configurations. We then analyze
the benefits of BS cooperation by deriving CRLBs for joint position and
velocity estimation in a general setting that encompasses multiple cooperating
monostatic systems and multistatic networks with multiple transmitters (Txs)
and receivers (Rxs). The influence of key system parameters, including the
number of BSs, bandwidth, antenna array configuration, and network geometry, is
systematically examined. Numerical results highlight the performance gains
enabled by cooperative sensing and provide insights to guide the design of
future ISAC systems.

Result: 在三种代表性轨道测试中，方法显著提高了计算效率且未牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 自适应高斯混合方法结合延迟分裂和高阶技术，有效解决了轨道不确定性传播的效率和精度问题。

Abstract: Accurate propagation of orbital uncertainty is essential for a range of
applications within space domain awareness. Adaptive Gaussian mixture-based
approaches offer tractable nonlinear uncertainty propagation through splitting
mixands to increase resolution in areas of stronger nonlinearities, as well as
by reducing mixands to prevent unnecessary computational effort. Recent work
introduced principled heuristics that incorporate information from the system
dynamics and initial uncertainty to determine optimal directions for splitting.
This paper develops adaptive uncertainty propagation methods based on these
robust splitting techniques. A deferred splitting algorithm tightly integrated
with higher-order splitting techniques is proposed and shown to offer
substantial gains in computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
Second-order propagation of mixand moments is also seen to improve accuracy
while retaining significant computational savings from deferred splitting.
Different immediate and deferred splitting methods are compared in three
representative test cases, including a geostationary orbit, a Molniya orbit,
and a periodic three-body orbit.

Conclusion: 该方法在无线感知应用中具有实际可行性，尤其在复杂场景下表现优异。

Abstract: In wireless sensing applications, such as ISAC, one of the first crucial
signal processing steps is the detection and estimation targets from a channel
estimate. Effective algorithms in this context must be robust across a broad
SNR range, capable of handling an unknown number of targets, and
computationally efficient for real-time implementation. During the last decade,
different Machine Learning methods have emerged as promising solutions, either
as standalone models or as complementing existing techniques. However, since
models are often trained and evaluated on synthetic data from existing models,
applying them to measurement is challenging. All the while, training directly
on measurement data is prohibitive in complex propagation scenarios as a
groundtruth is not available. Therefore, in this paper, we train a CNN approach
for target detection and estimation on synthetic data and evaluate it on
measurement data from a suburban outdoor measurement. Using knowledge of the
environment as well as available groundtruth positions, we study the detection
probability and accuracy of our approach. The results demonstrate that our
approach works on measurement data and is suitable for joint detection and
estimation of sensing targets in ISAC systems.

Abstract: This study presents an exploratory evaluation of Music Generation Systems
(MGS) within contemporary music production workflows by examining eight
open-source systems. The evaluation framework combines technical insights with
practical experimentation through criteria specifically designed to investigate
the practical and creative affordances of the systems within the iterative,
non-linear nature of music production. Employing a single-evaluator methodology
as a preliminary phase, this research adopts a mixed approach utilizing
qualitative methods to form hypotheses subsequently assessed through
quantitative metrics. The selected systems represent architectural diversity
across both symbolic and audio-based music generation approaches, spanning
composition, arrangement, and sound design tasks. The investigation addresses
limitations of current MGS in music production, challenges and opportunities
for workflow integration, and development potential as collaborative tools
while maintaining artistic authenticity. Findings reveal these systems function
primarily as complementary tools enhancing rather than replacing human
expertise. They exhibit limitations in maintaining thematic and structural
coherence that emphasize the indispensable role of human creativity in tasks
demanding emotional depth and complex decision-making. This study contributes a
structured evaluation framework that considers the iterative nature of music
creation. It identifies methodological refinements necessary for subsequent
comprehensive evaluations and determines viable areas for AI integration as
collaborative tools in creative workflows. The research provides
empirically-grounded insights to guide future development in the field.

Motivation: 现有MSS方法多针对多音色分离，忽视了相似音色乐器的分离问题。本文旨在填补这一空白，专注于单调音色MSS，尤其是古典吉他二重奏。

Method: 引入GuitarDuets数据集，改进Demucs架构用于单调音色分离，并开发了联合排列不变转录和分离框架，利用音符预测作为辅助信息。

Result: 结合真实和合成数据集的训练提升了分离效果，但音符预测的辅助作用有限。同时讨论了SDR和SI-SDR等指标在单调音色MSS中的表现。

Conclusion: 论文展示了单调音色MSS的可行性，并强调了数据集多样性对性能的重要性，同时指出了音符预测的潜力与局限。

Abstract: Recent advancements in music source separation (MSS) have focused in the
multi-timbral case, with existing architectures tailored for the separation of
distinct instruments, overlooking thus the challenge of separating instruments
with similar timbral characteristics. Addressing this gap, our work focuses on
monotimbral MSS, specifically within the context of classical guitar duets. To
this end, we introduce the GuitarDuets dataset, featuring a combined total of
approximately three hours of real and synthesized classical guitar duet
recordings, as well as note-level annotations of the synthesized duets. We
perform an extensive cross-dataset evaluation by adapting Demucs, a
state-of-the-art MSS architecture, to monotimbral source separation.
Furthermore, we develop a joint permutation-invariant transcription and
separation framework, to exploit note event predictions as auxiliary
information. Our results indicate that utilizing both the real and synthesized
subsets of GuitarDuets leads to improved separation performance in an
independently recorded test set compared to utilizing solely one subset. We
also find that while the availability of ground-truth note labels greatly helps
the performance of the separation network, the predicted note estimates result
only in marginal improvement. Finally, we discuss the behavior of commonly
utilized metrics, such as SDR and SI-SDR, in the context of monotimbral MSS.

Conclusion: SpeechAccentLLM框架在内容忠实性、时序一致性和结构可恢复性方面取得平衡，为FAC任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Foreign accent conversion (FAC) in speech processing remains a challenging
task. Building on the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) in
Text-to-Speech (TTS) tasks, this study investigates the adaptation of LLM-based
techniques for FAC, which we term SpeechAccentLLM. At the core of this
framework, we introduce SpeechCodeVAE, the first model to integrate
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) directly into codebook
discretization for speech content tokenization. This novel architecture
generates tokens with a unique "locality" property, as validated by experiments
demonstrating optimal trade-offs among content faithfulness, temporal
coherence, and structural recoverability. Then, to address data scarcity for
the FAC module, we adopted a multitask learning strategy that jointly trains
the FAC and TTS modules. Beyond mitigating data limitations, this approach
yielded accelerated convergence and superior speech quality compared to
standalone FAC training. Moreover, leveraging the salient properties of our
discrete speech representations, we introduce SpeechRestorer, a postprocessing
architecture designed to refine LLM-generated outputs. This module effectively
mitigates stochastic errors prevalent in LLM inference pipelines while
enhancing prosodic continuity, as validated by ablation experiments.

Conclusion: IdolSongsJp语料库为音乐信息处理研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Japanese idol groups, comprising performers known as "idols," are an
indispensable part of Japanese pop culture. They frequently appear in live
concerts and television programs, entertaining audiences with their singing and
dancing. Similar to other J-pop songs, idol group music covers a wide range of
styles, with various types of chord progressions and instrumental arrangements.
These tracks often feature numerous instruments and employ complex mastering
techniques, resulting in high signal loudness. Additionally, most songs include
a song division (utawari) structure, in which members alternate between singing
solos and performing together. Hence, these songs are well-suited for
benchmarking various music information processing techniques such as singer
diarization, music source separation, and automatic chord estimation under
challenging conditions. Focusing on these characteristics, we constructed a
song corpus titled IdolSongsJp by commissioning professional composers to
create 15 tracks in the style of Japanese idol groups. This corpus includes not
only mastered audio tracks but also stems for music source separation, dry
vocal tracks, and chord annotations. This paper provides a detailed description
of the corpus, demonstrates its diversity through comparisons with real-world
idol group songs, and presents its application in evaluating several music
information processing techniques.

Abstract: Perceived voice likability plays a crucial role in various social
interactions, such as partner selection and advertising. A system that provides
reference likable voice samples tailored to target audiences would enable users
to adjust their speaking style and voice quality, facilitating smoother
communication. To this end, we propose a voice conversion method that controls
the likability of input speech while preserving both speaker identity and
linguistic content. To improve training data scalability, we train a likability
predictor on an existing voice likability dataset and employ it to
automatically annotate a large speech synthesis corpus with likability ratings.
Experimental evaluations reveal a significant correlation between the
predictor's outputs and human-provided likability ratings. Subjective and
objective evaluations further demonstrate that the proposed approach
effectively controls voice likability while preserving both speaker identity
and linguistic content.

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了QHM、ARMA和神经网络的优势，显著提升了语音合成的性能。

Abstract: Vocoders, encoding speech signals into acoustic features and allowing for
speech signal reconstruction from them, have been studied for decades.
Recently, the rise of deep learning has particularly driven the development of
neural vocoders to generate high-quality speech signals. On the other hand, the
existing end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds
the speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech,
resulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and
resonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying
speech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation
usually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption.
In this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech
as sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process
to propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech
signals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to
model the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the
amplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the
speech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting
and time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network
size decrease. The experiments indicate that the proposed method leverages the
strengths of QHM, the ARMA model, and neural networks, leading to the
outperformance of our methods over other methods in terms of generation speed,
synthesis quality, and modification flexibility.

Abstract: The goal of voice anonymization is to modify an audio such that the true
identity of its speaker is hidden. Research on this task is typically limited
to the same English read speech datasets, thus the efficacy of current methods
for other types of speech data remains unknown. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of voice anonymization for the multilingual phenomenon of
code-switching speech. We prepare two corpora for this task and propose
adaptations to a multilingual anonymization model to make it applicable for
code-switching speech. By testing the anonymization performance of this and two
language-independent methods on the datasets, we find that only the
multilingual system performs well in terms of privacy and utility preservation.
Furthermore, we observe challenges in performing utility evaluations on this
data because of its spontaneous character and the limited code-switching
support by the multilingual speech recognition model.

Motivation: 旨在解决当前MGS在音乐制作中的局限性，探索其作为协作工具的潜力，同时保持艺术真实性。

Method: 采用单评估者方法，结合定性和定量分析，评估符号和音频生成系统的多样性。

Result: 发现MGS主要作为辅助工具，无法完全替代人类创造力，尤其在情感深度和复杂决策任务中。

Conclusion: 研究贡献了一个结构化评价框架，为未来MGS开发和AI集成提供了实证依据。

Abstract: This study presents an exploratory evaluation of Music Generation Systems
(MGS) within contemporary music production workflows by examining eight
open-source systems. The evaluation framework combines technical insights with
practical experimentation through criteria specifically designed to investigate
the practical and creative affordances of the systems within the iterative,
non-linear nature of music production. Employing a single-evaluator methodology
as a preliminary phase, this research adopts a mixed approach utilizing
qualitative methods to form hypotheses subsequently assessed through
quantitative metrics. The selected systems represent architectural diversity
across both symbolic and audio-based music generation approaches, spanning
composition, arrangement, and sound design tasks. The investigation addresses
limitations of current MGS in music production, challenges and opportunities
for workflow integration, and development potential as collaborative tools
while maintaining artistic authenticity. Findings reveal these systems function
primarily as complementary tools enhancing rather than replacing human
expertise. They exhibit limitations in maintaining thematic and structural
coherence that emphasize the indispensable role of human creativity in tasks
demanding emotional depth and complex decision-making. This study contributes a
structured evaluation framework that considers the iterative nature of music
creation. It identifies methodological refinements necessary for subsequent
comprehensive evaluations and determines viable areas for AI integration as
collaborative tools in creative workflows. The research provides
empirically-grounded insights to guide future development in the field.

TL;DR: 该论文专注于单调音色的音乐源分离（MSS），特别是古典吉他二重奏，通过引入GuitarDuets数据集和优化现有架构，提升了分离性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MSS方法多针对多音色分离，忽略了相似音色乐器的分离挑战，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入GuitarDuets数据集，结合真实与合成录音；改进Demucs架构用于单调音色分离；开发联合排列不变转录与分离框架。

Result: 结合真实与合成数据集的训练提升了分离性能；真实音符标签显著帮助分离，而预测音符标签效果有限。

Conclusion: 单调音色MSS中，数据多样性和音符标签是关键，但现有指标（如SDR和SI-SDR）需进一步探讨。

Abstract: Recent advancements in music source separation (MSS) have focused in the
multi-timbral case, with existing architectures tailored for the separation of
distinct instruments, overlooking thus the challenge of separating instruments
with similar timbral characteristics. Addressing this gap, our work focuses on
monotimbral MSS, specifically within the context of classical guitar duets. To
this end, we introduce the GuitarDuets dataset, featuring a combined total of
approximately three hours of real and synthesized classical guitar duet
recordings, as well as note-level annotations of the synthesized duets. We
perform an extensive cross-dataset evaluation by adapting Demucs, a
state-of-the-art MSS architecture, to monotimbral source separation.
Furthermore, we develop a joint permutation-invariant transcription and
separation framework, to exploit note event predictions as auxiliary
information. Our results indicate that utilizing both the real and synthesized
subsets of GuitarDuets leads to improved separation performance in an
independently recorded test set compared to utilizing solely one subset. We
also find that while the availability of ground-truth note labels greatly helps
the performance of the separation network, the predicted note estimates result
only in marginal improvement. Finally, we discuss the behavior of commonly
utilized metrics, such as SDR and SI-SDR, in the context of monotimbral MSS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外语口音转换（FAC）在语音处理中仍具挑战性，研究旨在利用LLM在文本到语音（TTS）任务中的成功经验，解决FAC问题。

Method: 提出SpeechCodeVAE模型，将CTC直接集成到语音内容标记化中；采用多任务学习策略联合训练FAC和TTS模块；引入SpeechRestorer后处理模块优化LLM输出。

Result: 实验验证了SpeechCodeVAE的标记化具有独特的“局部性”特性，多任务学习加速了收敛并提高了语音质量，SpeechRestorer有效减少了LLM推理中的随机错误。

Conclusion: SpeechAccentLLM框架在FAC任务中表现出色，解决了数据稀缺问题，并提升了语音生成的质量和连续性。

Abstract: Foreign accent conversion (FAC) in speech processing remains a challenging
task. Building on the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) in
Text-to-Speech (TTS) tasks, this study investigates the adaptation of LLM-based
techniques for FAC, which we term SpeechAccentLLM. At the core of this
framework, we introduce SpeechCodeVAE, the first model to integrate
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) directly into codebook
discretization for speech content tokenization. This novel architecture
generates tokens with a unique "locality" property, as validated by experiments
demonstrating optimal trade-offs among content faithfulness, temporal
coherence, and structural recoverability. Then, to address data scarcity for
the FAC module, we adopted a multitask learning strategy that jointly trains
the FAC and TTS modules. Beyond mitigating data limitations, this approach
yielded accelerated convergence and superior speech quality compared to
standalone FAC training. Moreover, leveraging the salient properties of our
discrete speech representations, we introduce SpeechRestorer, a postprocessing
architecture designed to refine LLM-generated outputs. This module effectively
mitigates stochastic errors prevalent in LLM inference pipelines while
enhancing prosodic continuity, as validated by ablation experiments.

Result: 语料库展示了多样性，并与真实偶像歌曲进行了比较，成功应用于多种音乐信息处理技术的评估。

Conclusion: IdolSongsJp语料库为音乐信息处理研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Japanese idol groups, comprising performers known as "idols," are an
indispensable part of Japanese pop culture. They frequently appear in live
concerts and television programs, entertaining audiences with their singing and
dancing. Similar to other J-pop songs, idol group music covers a wide range of
styles, with various types of chord progressions and instrumental arrangements.
These tracks often feature numerous instruments and employ complex mastering
techniques, resulting in high signal loudness. Additionally, most songs include
a song division (utawari) structure, in which members alternate between singing
solos and performing together. Hence, these songs are well-suited for
benchmarking various music information processing techniques such as singer
diarization, music source separation, and automatic chord estimation under
challenging conditions. Focusing on these characteristics, we constructed a
song corpus titled IdolSongsJp by commissioning professional composers to
create 15 tracks in the style of Japanese idol groups. This corpus includes not
only mastered audio tracks but also stems for music source separation, dry
vocal tracks, and chord annotations. This paper provides a detailed description
of the corpus, demonstrates its diversity through comparisons with real-world
idol group songs, and presents its application in evaluating several music
information processing techniques.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现语音好感度的可控调整，同时保持说话者身份和语言内容。

Abstract: Perceived voice likability plays a crucial role in various social
interactions, such as partner selection and advertising. A system that provides
reference likable voice samples tailored to target audiences would enable users
to adjust their speaking style and voice quality, facilitating smoother
communication. To this end, we propose a voice conversion method that controls
the likability of input speech while preserving both speaker identity and
linguistic content. To improve training data scalability, we train a likability
predictor on an existing voice likability dataset and employ it to
automatically annotate a large speech synthesis corpus with likability ratings.
Experimental evaluations reveal a significant correlation between the
predictor's outputs and human-provided likability ratings. Subjective and
objective evaluations further demonstrate that the proposed approach
effectively controls voice likability while preserving both speaker identity
and linguistic content.

Conclusion: 提出的方法结合了QHM、ARMA模型和神经网络的优点，显著提升了声码器的性能。

Abstract: Vocoders, encoding speech signals into acoustic features and allowing for
speech signal reconstruction from them, have been studied for decades.
Recently, the rise of deep learning has particularly driven the development of
neural vocoders to generate high-quality speech signals. On the other hand, the
existing end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds
the speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech,
resulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and
resonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying
speech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation
usually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption.
In this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech
as sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process
to propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech
signals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to
model the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the
amplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the
speech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting
and time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network
size decrease. The experiments indicate that the proposed method leverages the
strengths of QHM, the ARMA model, and neural networks, leading to the
outperformance of our methods over other methods in terms of generation speed,
synthesis quality, and modification flexibility.

Conclusion: 用户参与的扩散生成方法在音乐源分离中具有潜力。

Abstract: Music source separation (MSS) aims to extract individual instrument sources
from their mixture. While most existing methods focus on the widely adopted
four-stem separation setup (vocals, bass, drums, and other instruments), this
approach lacks the flexibility needed for real-world applications. To address
this, we propose GuideSep, a diffusion-based MSS model capable of
instrument-agnostic separation beyond the four-stem setup. GuideSep is
conditioned on multiple inputs: a waveform mimicry condition, which can be
easily provided by humming or playing the target melody, and mel-spectrogram
domain masks, which offer additional guidance for separation. Unlike prior
approaches that relied on fixed class labels or sound queries, our conditioning
scheme, coupled with the generative approach, provides greater flexibility and
applicability. Additionally, we design a mask-prediction baseline using the
same model architecture to systematically compare predictive and generative
approaches. Our objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that GuideSep
achieves high-quality separation while enabling more versatile instrument
extraction, highlighting the potential of user participation in the
diffusion-based generative process for MSS. Our code and demo page are

Abstract: We present a full-stack emergency vehicle (EV) siren detection system
designed for real-time deployment on embedded hardware. The proposed approach
is based on E2PANNs, a fine-tuned convolutional neural network derived from
EPANNs, and optimized for binary sound event detection under urban acoustic
conditions. A key contribution is the creation of curated and semantically
structured datasets - AudioSet-EV, AudioSet-EV Augmented, and Unified-EV -
developed using a custom AudioSet-Tools framework to overcome the low
reliability of standard AudioSet annotations. The system is deployed on a
Raspberry Pi 5 equipped with a high-fidelity DAC+microphone board, implementing
a multithreaded inference engine with adaptive frame sizing, probability
smoothing, and a decision-state machine to control false positive activations.
A remote WebSocket interface provides real-time monitoring and facilitates live
demonstration capabilities. Performance is evaluated using both framewise and
event-based metrics across multiple configurations. Results show the system
achieves low-latency detection with improved robustness under realistic audio
conditions. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying IoS-compatible
SED solutions that can form distributed acoustic monitoring networks, enabling
collaborative emergency vehicle tracking across smart city infrastructures
through WebSocket connectivity on low-cost edge devices.

*Jing Luo,Xinyu Yang,Jie Wei*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为XMVAE的模型，用于从零生成古典钢琴表演，结合作曲家和演奏家的双重角色，通过ECP表示和双分支结构实现高质量的表演生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 古典音乐的创意不仅来自作曲家，还来自演奏家对静态乐谱的诠释。本文旨在模拟这一双重角色，解决从零生成古典钢琴表演的挑战。

Method: 引入ECP表示捕捉表演的韵律结构和表现细节，提出XMVAE模型，包含VQ-VAE分支（作曲家）和VAE分支（演奏家），使用多尺度编码器和正交Transformer解码器。

Result: XMVAE生成的古典表演在客观和主观评估中均优于现有模型，且作曲家分支的预训练显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: XMVAE成功模拟了作曲家和演奏家的双重角色，生成高质量的古典钢琴表演，为音乐生成领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: The creativity of classical music arises not only from composers who craft
the musical sheets but also from performers who interpret the static notations
with expressive nuances. This paper addresses the challenge of generating
classical piano performances from scratch, aiming to emulate the dual roles of
composer and pianist in the creative process. We introduce the Expressive
Compound Word (ECP) representation, which effectively captures both the
metrical structure and expressive nuances of classical performances. Building
on this, we propose the Expressive Music Variational AutoEncoder (XMVAE), a
model featuring two branches: a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder
(VQ-VAE) branch that generates score-related content, representing the
Composer, and a vanilla VAE branch that produces expressive details, fulfilling
the role of Pianist. These branches are jointly trained with similar Seq2Seq
architectures, leveraging a multiscale encoder to capture beat-level contextual
information and an orthogonal Transformer decoder for efficient compound tokens
decoding. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that XMVAE
generates classical performances with superior musical quality compared to
state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, pretraining the Composer branch on extra
musical score datasets contribute to a significant performance gain.

Abstract: This work addresses the development of a database for the automatic
assessment of text-to-speech (TTS) systems in Spanish, aiming to improve the
accuracy of naturalness prediction models. The dataset consists of 4,326 audio
samples from 52 different TTS systems and human voices and is, up to our
knowledge, the first of its kind in Spanish. To label the audios, a subjective
test was designed based on the ITU-T Rec. P.807 standard and completed by 92
participants. Furthermore, the utility of the collected dataset was validated
by training automatic naturalness prediction systems. We explored two
approaches: fine-tuning an existing model originally trained for English, and
training small downstream networks on top of frozen self-supervised speech
models. Our models achieve a mean absolute error of 0.8 on a five-point MOS
scale. Further analysis demonstrates the quality and diversity of the developed
dataset, and its potential to advance TTS research in Spanish.

*Yutong Wen,Minje Kim,Paris Smaragdis*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: GuideSep是一种基于扩散模型的音乐源分离方法，支持乐器无关的分离，通过波形模仿和频谱掩码提供灵活指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于四音轨分离（人声、贝斯、鼓和其他乐器），缺乏灵活性，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 提出GuideSep，结合波形模仿条件和频谱掩码，利用扩散模型实现乐器无关的分离。

Result: GuideSep在客观和主观评估中均表现出高质量分离效果，支持更灵活的乐器提取。

Conclusion: GuideSep展示了扩散模型在音乐源分离中的潜力，用户参与生成过程可提升灵活性。

Abstract: Music source separation (MSS) aims to extract individual instrument sources
from their mixture. While most existing methods focus on the widely adopted
four-stem separation setup (vocals, bass, drums, and other instruments), this
approach lacks the flexibility needed for real-world applications. To address
this, we propose GuideSep, a diffusion-based MSS model capable of
instrument-agnostic separation beyond the four-stem setup. GuideSep is
conditioned on multiple inputs: a waveform mimicry condition, which can be
easily provided by humming or playing the target melody, and mel-spectrogram
domain masks, which offer additional guidance for separation. Unlike prior
approaches that relied on fixed class labels or sound queries, our conditioning
scheme, coupled with the generative approach, provides greater flexibility and
applicability. Additionally, we design a mask-prediction baseline using the
same model architecture to systematically compare predictive and generative
approaches. Our objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that GuideSep
achieves high-quality separation while enabling more versatile instrument
extraction, highlighting the potential of user participation in the
diffusion-based generative process for MSS. Our code and demo page are
available at https://yutongwen.github.io/GuideSep/

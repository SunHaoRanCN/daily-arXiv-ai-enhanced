A fundamental question,\nhowever, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of\nspatial multiplexing in the distance domain?\n  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF\nof a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit\naperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at\nthe same angular direction) but located at different distances from the\ntransmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are\ncontinuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and\ninfinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees\nof freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case\nwhere the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad\nside of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral\noperator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form\nexpression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows\nthat the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the\nextreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We\nfurther extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a\nprojection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent\nbroadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular\narray, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the\nconstraint of the physical length of the array.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u8fd1\u573a\u533a\u57df\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u6781\u5927\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff08DoF\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u57df\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u7684\u6700\u5927\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fdc\u573a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u89d2\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u540c\u65f6\u670d\u52a1\u591a\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u800c\u8fd1\u573a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d44\u6e90\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u8ddd\u79bb\u57df\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u7684\u6700\u5927\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u7ef4\u53d1\u5c04\u5b54\u5f84\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a5\u6536\u9635\u5217\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u89c6\u8ddd\uff08LoS\uff09\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u6b63\u4fa7\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u9635\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u9635\u5217\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u8fb9\u754c\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u9635\u5217\u5728\u7269\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u6bd4\u5355\u5757\u9635\u5217\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u8fd1\u573a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9635\u5217\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u9635\u5217\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

On the other hand, the\nexisting end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds\nthe speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech,\nresulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and\nresonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying\nspeech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation\nusually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption.\nIn this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech\nas sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process\nto propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech\nsignals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to\nmodel the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the\namplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the\nspeech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting\nand time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network\nsize decrease.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a Transfer Learning (TL)-based approach for VLC-based\nindoor localization. Using real-world data collected at a BOSCH factory, the TL\nframework integrates a deep neural network (DNN) to improve localization\naccuracy by 47\\%, reduce energy consumption by 32\\%, and decrease computational\ntime by 40\\% compared to the conventional models. The proposed solution is\nhighly adaptable under varying environmental conditions and achieves similar\naccuracy with only 30\\% of the dataset, making it a cost-efficient and scalable\noption for industrial applications in Industry 4.0.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684VLC\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7cbe\u51c6\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9700\u6c42\u8feb\u5207\uff0cVLC\u6280\u672f\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u5382\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534747%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e32%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1140%\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u970030%\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5de5\u4e1a4.0\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Although the proposed FSA experiences additional\npath-gain attenuation in the received signals, it can overcome several hardware\nand signal processing issues incurred by MAs, such as limited positioning\naccuracy, considerable response latency, and demanding hardware and energy\ncost. To shed useful insights, we first consider a secrecy-guaranteed problem\nwith a null-steering constraint for which maximum ratio transmission (MRT)\nbeamformer is considered at Alice and the frequency offsets are set as uniform\nfrequency increment.

Perceptual\nratings were standardized using the novel 5-point PERCEPT Rating Scale and\ntraining protocol.

To address\nthis, we propose GuideSep, a diffusion-based MSS model capable of\ninstrument-agnostic separation beyond the four-stem setup. GuideSep is\nconditioned on multiple inputs: a waveform mimicry condition, which can be\neasily provided by humming or playing the target melody, and mel-spectrogram\ndomain masks, which offer additional guidance for separation. Unlike prior\napproaches that relied on fixed class labels or sound queries, our conditioning\nscheme, coupled with the generative approach, provides greater flexibility and\napplicability. Additionally, we design a mask-prediction baseline using the\nsame model architecture to systematically compare predictive and generative\napproaches.

Part of this work has been submitted to IEEE\n  Globecom 2025 (under review). This version has been submitted to IEEE\n  Transactions on Communications for possible publication", "summary": "Extremely large aperture array operating in the near-field regime unlocks\nadditional spatial resources that can be exploited to simultaneously serve\nmultiple users even when they share the same angular direction, a capability\nnot achievable in conventional far-field systems. A fundamental question,\nhowever, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of\nspatial multiplexing in the distance domain?\n  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF\nof a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit\naperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at\nthe same angular direction) but located at different distances from the\ntransmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are\ncontinuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and\ninfinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees\nof freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case\nwhere the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad\nside of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral\noperator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form\nexpression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform.

This paper addresses the challenge of generating\nclassical piano performances from scratch, aiming to emulate the dual roles of\ncomposer and pianist in the creative process. We introduce the Expressive\nCompound Word (ECP) representation, which effectively captures both the\nmetrical structure and expressive nuances of classical performances. Building\non this, we propose the Expressive Music Variational AutoEncoder (XMVAE), a\nmodel featuring two branches: a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder\n(VQ-VAE) branch that generates score-related content, representing the\nComposer, and a vanilla VAE branch that produces expressive details, fulfilling\nthe role of Pianist. These branches are jointly trained with similar Seq2Seq\narchitectures, leveraging a multiscale encoder to capture beat-level contextual\ninformation and an orthogonal Transformer decoder for efficient compound tokens\ndecoding. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that XMVAE\ngenerates classical performances with superior musical quality compared to\nstate-of-the-art models.

On the other hand, the\nexisting end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds\nthe speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech,\nresulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and\nresonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying\nspeech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation\nusually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption.\nIn this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech\nas sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process\nto propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech\nsignals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to\nmodel the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the\namplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the\nspeech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting\nand time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network\nsize decrease. The experiments indicate that the proposed method leverages the\nstrengths of QHM, the ARMA model, and neural networks, leading to the\noutperformance of our methods over other methods in terms of generation speed,\nsynthesis quality, and modification flexibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u51c6\u8c10\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\uff08QHM\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u58f0\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u795e\u7ecf\u58f0\u7801\u5668\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u795e\u7ecf\u58f0\u7801\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6e05\u6670\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u548c\u5171\u632f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5408\u6210\u6216\u4fee\u6539\u8bed\u97f3\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f51\u7edc\u590d\u6742\u5bfc\u81f4\u8017\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cQHM\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\uff08ARMA\uff09\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u5171\u632f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u8c10\u6ce2\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86QHM\u3001ARMA\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u58f0\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

By testing the anonymization performance of this and two\nlanguage-independent methods on the datasets, we find that only the\nmultilingual system performs well in terms of privacy and utility preservation.\nFurthermore, we observe challenges in performing utility evaluations on this\ndata because of its spontaneous character and the limited code-switching\nsupport by the multilingual speech recognition model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u97f3\u533f\u540d\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\u6717\u8bfb\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6548\u679c\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u8bed\u97f3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u53ea\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u53d1\u6027\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u8bed\u97f3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

First, we analytically show that by flexibly\ncontrolling the carrier frequency parameters, FSAs can effectively form\nuniform/non-uniform sparse arrays, hence resembling movable antennas (MAs) in\nthe control of inter-antenna spacing and providing additional degree-of-freedom\n(DoF) in the beam control. Although the proposed FSA experiences additional\npath-gain attenuation in the received signals, it can overcome several hardware\nand signal processing issues incurred by MAs, such as limited positioning\naccuracy, considerable response latency, and demanding hardware and energy\ncost. To shed useful insights, we first consider a secrecy-guaranteed problem\nwith a null-steering constraint for which maximum ratio transmission (MRT)\nbeamformer is considered at Alice and the frequency offsets are set as uniform\nfrequency increment. Interestingly, it is shown that the proposed FSA can\nflexibly realize null-steering over Eve in both the angular domain (by tuning\ncarrier frequency) and range domain (by controlling per-antenna frequency\noffset), thereby achieving improved PLS performance. Then, for the general\ncase, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex\nproblem by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) and projected gradient\nascent (PGA) techniques.

Using Fisher information analysis,\nwe first derive closed-form Cram\\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for target\nlocalization in single monostatic and bistatic configurations. We then analyze\nthe benefits of BS cooperation by deriving CRLBs for joint position and\nvelocity estimation in a general setting that encompasses multiple cooperating\nmonostatic systems and multistatic networks with multiple transmitters (Txs)\nand receivers (Rxs). The influence of key system parameters, including the\nnumber of BSs, bandwidth, antenna array configuration, and network geometry, is\nsystematically examined.

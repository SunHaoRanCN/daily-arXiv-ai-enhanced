However, due to the lack of L2\nspeech synthesis datasets, it is difficult to synthesize L2 speech for\nlow-resourced languages. In this paper, we provide a practical solution for\nediting native speech to approximate L2 speech and present PPG2Speech, a\ndiffusion-based multispeaker Phonetic-Posteriorgrams-to-Speech model that is\ncapable of editing a single phoneme without text alignment. We use Matcha-TTS's\nflow-matching decoder as the backbone, transforming Phonetic Posteriorgrams\n(PPGs) to mel-spectrograms conditioned on external speaker embeddings and\npitch. PPG2Speech strengthens the Matcha-TTS's flow-matching decoder with\nClassifier-free Guidance (CFG) and Sway Sampling. We also propose a new\ntask-specific objective evaluation metric, the Phonetic Aligned Consistency\n(PAC), between the edited PPGs and the PPGs extracted from the synthetic speech\nfor editing effects.

To that end, we minimize the average\npower consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly\noptimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit\nbeamforming.

By\nharnessing permutation properties broadly exist in resource allocation\npolicies, each mapping measurable environmental parameters (e.g., channel\nmatrix) to optimized variables (e.g., precoding matrix), graph neural networks\n(GNNs) are promising for learning these policies efficiently in terms of\nscalability and generalizability. To reap the benefits of both architectures,\nthere is a recent trend of incorporating attention mechanism with GNNs for\nlearning wireless policies. Nevertheless, is the attention mechanism really\nneeded for resource allocation? In this paper, we strive to answer this\nquestion by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical\nalgorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are\ninduced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the\npermutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed\nby two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not. We\nproceed to re-express the numerical algorithms for optimizing several\nrepresentative resource allocation problems in recursive forms.

### [1] [Derivative-Free Optimization-Empowered Wireless Channel Reconfiguration for 6G](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02243)
*Peilan Wang,Jun Fang,Xianlong Zeng,Bin Wang,Zhi Chen,Yonina C. Eldar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需信道建模和隐式环境传播参数估计的零阶优化方法，用于直接优化可重构天线的系数，以改善无线端到端信道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在6G及未来的无线通信中，如何实时优化可重构设备的系数以形成理想的端到端无线信道是一个重大挑战。

Method: 采用零阶优化技术，直接优化可重构系数，无需复杂的信道建模和隐式参数估计。

Conclusion: 零阶优化为可重构天线技术提供了新的研究方向，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Reconfigurable antennas, including reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS),
movable antenna (MA), fluid antenna (FA), and other advanced antenna
techniques, have been studied extensively in the context of reshaping wireless
propagation environments for 6G and beyond wireless communications.
Nevertheless, how to reconfigure/optimize the real-time controllable
coefficients to achieve a favorable end-to-end wireless channel remains a
substantial challenge, as it usually requires accurate modeling of the complex
interaction between the reconfigurable devices and the electromagnetic waves,
as well as knowledge of implicit channel propagation parameters. In this paper,
we introduce a derivative-free optimization (a.k.a., zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization) technique to directly optimize reconfigurable coefficients to
shape the wireless end-to-end channel, without the need of channel modeling and
estimation of the implicit environmental propagation parameters. We present the
fundamental principles of ZO optimization and discuss its potential advantages
in wireless channel reconfiguration. Two case studies for RIS and movable
antenna-enabled single-input single-output (SISO) systems are provided to show
the superiority of ZO-based methods as compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
Finally, we outline promising future research directions and offer concluding
insights on derivative-free optimization for reconfigurable antenna
technologies.

### [2] [Localized kernel method for separation of linear chirps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02262)
*Eric Mason,Sippanon Kitimoon,Hrushikesh Mhaskar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的信号分离算子（SSO）方法，用于在低信噪比、交叉和间断情况下分离啁啾信号，并进行了理论分析和数值验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信号处理中叠加信号分离的挑战，特别是在低信噪比、交叉和间断情况下分离啁啾信号的需求。

Method: 改进和扩展了Chui和Mhaskar提出的信号分离算子（SSO）方法，结合理论分析噪声对SSO行为的影响。

Result: 通过模拟数据集（包含7个信号）验证了方法的有效性，并分析了最小分离、最小振幅、信噪比和采样频率之间的关系。

Conclusion: 改进的SSO方法在复杂条件下能有效分离啁啾信号，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual
components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing
applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous
paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator
(SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such
superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In
this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp
signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We
give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to
examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude,
SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and
numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated
signals.

Abstract: This study examines an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
transceiver featuring a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable
intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and a receiver equipped with a passive
electronically scanned array (PESA) and a single digital channel. By utilizing
a periodic pulsed signal emitted by a feeder, we introduce at the STAR-RIS a
space modulation to illuminate two angular directions observed by the radar
receiver, one in each half-space, and a time modulation to distinguish the
corresponding echoes from prospective moving targets and embed communication
messages. The proposed time modulation employs orthogonal binary codebooks with
different trade-offs in transmission and error rates, while having minimal
impact on the radar performance, evaluated by probability of detection and root
mean square error in the radial velocity estimation.

### [4] [Joint Radiation Power, Antenna Position, and Beamforming Optimization for Pinching-Antenna Systems with Motion Power Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02348)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了考虑天线运动功耗和可调辐射功率的Pinching-antenna系统（PASS）设计，通过联合优化天线位置、辐射功率比和波束成形，最小化功耗以满足服务质量要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽略了天线放置的物理约束和固定辐射功率的假设，本文填补了这一研究空白。

Method: 提出基于ADMM的框架解决连续天线移动问题，离散问题则通过BCD方法求解MINLP。

Result: 仿真结果表明，考虑天线运动功耗和可调辐射功率显著提升了PASS性能，且优于传统MIMO系统。

Conclusion: PASS在减少路径损耗和用户间干扰方面具有优势，优化框架高效可行。

Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have been recently proposed to improve the
performance of wireless networks by reconfiguring both the large-scale and
small-scale channel conditions. However, existing studies ignore the physical
constraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To
fill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into
account the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact
of adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average
power consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly
optimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit
beamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to
consider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional
degree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and
discrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the
fact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the
channel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To
tackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for
continuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a
mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block
coordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance
enhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and
adjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the
efficiency of the proposed optimization framework. The benefits of PASS over
conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in mitigating the
large-scale path loss and inter-user interference is also revealed.

Abstract: This study considers a base station equipped with sensing and communication
capabilities, which serves a ground user and scans a portion of the sky via a
passive reconfigurable intelligent surface. To achieve more favorable system
tradeoffs, we utilize a multi-frame radar detector, comprising a detector, a
plot-extractor, and a track-before-detect processor. The main idea proposed
here is that user spectral efficiency can be enhanced by increasing the number
of scans jointly processed by the multi-frame radar detector while maintaining
the same sensing performance. A numerical analysis is conducted to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed solution and to evaluate the achievable system
tradeoffs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LAWN在物联网系统中实现延迟敏感控制应用的潜力，解决无人机与AGV间的实时无线控制问题。

Method: 结合MPC和FBL传输分析通信可靠性，提出联合优化控制策略、功率分配和无人机轨迹的非凸问题，并通过二次规划和交替优化框架求解。

Result: 仿真和实验验证了所提方法在控制性能上的优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的优化框架有效解决了LAWN中的实时控制问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have been envisioned as flexible and
transformative platforms for enabling delay-sensitive control applications in
Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In this work, we investigate the real-time
wireless control over a LAWN system, where an aerial drone is employed to serve
multiple mobile automated guided vehicles (AGVs) via finite blocklength (FBL)
transmission. Toward this end, we adopt the model predictive control (MPC) to
ensure accurate trajectory tracking, while we analyze the communication
reliability using the outage probability. Subsequently, we formulate an
optimization problem to jointly determine control policy, transmit power
allocation, and drone trajectory by accounting for the maximum travel distance
and control input constraints. To address the resultant non-convex optimization
problem, we first derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability
under FBL transmission. Based on this, we reformulate the original problem as a
quadratic programming (QP) problem, followed by developing an alternating
optimization (AO) framework. Specifically, we employ the projected gradient
descent (PGD) method and the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to
achieve computationally efficient sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, we
thoroughly analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed
algorithm. Extensive simulations and AirSim-based experiments are conducted to
validate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to the baseline
schemes in terms of control performance.

### [7] [Parameter estimation of range-migrating targets using OTFS signals from LEO satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02385)
*Tong Ding,Luca Venturino,Emanuele Grossi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种基于通信的集成传感与通信（ISAC）系统，利用低地球轨道（LEO）卫星发射的正交时频空间（OTFS）调制信号估计高速空间目标的参数。通过OTFS收发器的信号处理，提出了新的输入输出模型，并发现目标响应在延迟-多普勒域具有稀疏结构。基于此，提出了最大似然估计器的近似实现方法，并通过数值实验验证了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用LEO卫星的OTFS信号估计高速空间目标的参数，解决传统方法中因目标高速运动导致的信号处理难题。

Method: 利用OTFS收发器的信号处理特性，推导目标回波的输入输出模型，提出基于块正交匹配追踪和匹配滤波器组的最大似然估计器近似实现方法。

Result: 目标响应在延迟-多普勒域呈现稀疏结构，且初始距离和距离速率是主要影响因素。提出的估计方法在数值实验中表现出良好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过OTFS信号和稀疏结构特性，成功实现了对高速空间目标参数的估计，为ISAC系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This study investigates a communication-centric integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system that utilizes orthogonal time frequency space
(OTFS) modulated signals emitted by low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to
estimate the parameters of space targets experiencing range migration,
henceforth referred to as high-speed targets. Leveraging the specific signal
processing performed by OTFS transceivers, we derive a novel input-output model
for the echo generated by a high-speed target in scenarios where ideal and
rectangular shaping filters are employed. Our findings reveal that the target
response exhibits a sparse structure in the delay-Doppler domain, dependent
solely upon the initial range and range-rate; notably, range migration causes a
spread in the target response, marking a significant departure from previous
studies. Utilizing this signal structure, we propose an approximate
implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the target's initial
range, range-rate, and amplitude. The estimation process involves obtaining
coarse information on the target response using a block orthogonal matching
pursuit algorithm, followed by a refinement step using a bank of matched
filters focused on a smaller range and range-rate region. Finally, numerical
examples are provided to evaluate the estimation performance.

### [8] [When Attention is Beneficial for Learning Wireless Resource Allocation Efficiently?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02427)
*Jia Guo,Chenyang Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了注意力机制在图神经网络（GNNs）中是否必要，通过分析集合上的函数结构和数值算法，发现干扰未反映时可省略注意力机制，并提出了一种设计GNN的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力机制在资源分配中的必要性，以提升GNNs在无线策略学习中的效率和通用性。

Method: 分析集合上的置换等变函数结构，递归表达数值算法，并通过模拟验证提出的GNN设计框架。

Result: 发现干扰未反映时可省略注意力机制，提出的GNN框架在混合预编码中表现出高效学习能力。

Conclusion: 注意力机制在特定条件下可省略，提出的GNN设计框架为资源分配提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Owing to the use of attention mechanism to leverage the dependency across
tokens, Transformers are efficient for natural language processing. By
harnessing permutation properties broadly exist in resource allocation
policies, each mapping measurable environmental parameters (e.g., channel
matrix) to optimized variables (e.g., precoding matrix), graph neural networks
(GNNs) are promising for learning these policies efficiently in terms of
scalability and generalizability. To reap the benefits of both architectures,
there is a recent trend of incorporating attention mechanism with GNNs for
learning wireless policies. Nevertheless, is the attention mechanism really
needed for resource allocation? In this paper, we strive to answer this
question by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical
algorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are
induced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the
permutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed
by two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not. We
proceed to re-express the numerical algorithms for optimizing several
representative resource allocation problems in recursive forms. We find that
when interference (say multi-user or inter-data stream interference) is not
reflected in the measurable parameters of a policy, attention needs to be used
to model the interference. With the insight, we establish a framework of
designing GNNs by aligning with the structures. By taking reconfigurable
intelligent surface-aided hybrid precoding as an example, the learning
efficiency of the proposed GNN is validated via simulations.

### [9] [Corrections to Published Values of Frequency Sampling Filter Transition Coefficients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02556)
*C. S. Ramalingam*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文分析了Rabiner等人和Lyons提出的频率采样滤波器（FSF）设计中的过渡系数和峰值旁瓣水平（PSL）的差异，并提供了更优的数值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现Rabiner等人和Lyons在FSF设计中提供的过渡系数和PSL值存在差异且不最优，需修正并提供更准确的数据。

Method: 通过程序计算优化，重新估计低通和带通滤波器的过渡系数及PSL值。

Result: 找到了更优的过渡系数（如N=16和BW=4时为0.40474097），并修正了PSL值。

Conclusion: 论文提供了更准确的FSF设计参数，修正了前人工作中的错误。

Abstract: Tables of optimal transition coefficients and peak sidelobe level (PSL, in
dB) associated with frequency sampling filter (FSF) design were published by
Rabiner et al. (Jun 1970), and reproduced, for example, in the book Digital
Signal Processing by Proakis and Manolakis (4/e, 2007). A set of values are
also given in Appendix H of Understanding Digital Signal Processing} by Lyons
(3/e, 2011), but there are significant differences between these two sets. For
example, for $N=16$ and BW$=4$, two different transition coefficient values
have been reported, viz., $0.38916626$ (Rabiner, et al.) and $0.34918551$
(Lyons). Neither is optimal, for we find the optimum value to be $0.40474097$.
The published values of the corresponding PSLs were also found to be incorrect.
In this paper we give the optimal values of the transition coefficients and PSL
values as estimated by our program for the lowpass and bandpass filters listed
in Rabiner et al. and Lyons.

### [10] [Pinching-Antenna-Assisted Index Modulation: Channel Modeling, Transceiver Design, and Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02641)
*Shuaixin Yang,Yijia Li,Yue Xiao,Yong Liang Guan,Xianfu Lei,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的夹持天线辅助索引调制（PA-IM）方案，通过结合天线位置模式和QAM符号提高频谱效率，同时保持硬件复杂度不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不增加硬件复杂度的前提下提高频谱效率，解决传统调制方案的限制。

Method: 设计了全面的收发器方案，包括信道建模、低复杂度信号检测算法（BOSD）、BER分析及基于流形优化的预编码方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，PA-IM方案在性能上显著优于传统方案，预编码设计大幅降低了系统BER。

Conclusion: PA-IM方案在频谱效率和性能上均有显著提升，为未来通信系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel pinching-antenna assisted index modulation (PA-IM)
scheme is proposed for improving the spectral efficiency without increasing the
hardware complexity, where the information bits are conveyed not only by the
conventional M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols but also by
the indices of pinching antenna (PA) position patterns. To realize the full
potential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver
design, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and
performance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel
model is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the
deterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of
wireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading.
Next, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML)
detection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is
designed, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML
performance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER)
is derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding
method is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by
jointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the
waveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all
received signal points. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed PA-IM scheme attains a significant performance gain over its
conventional counterparts and that the overall BER of the pinching-antenna
system is substantially improved by the proposed precoding design.

*Jiazhe Li,Nicolò Decarli,Francesco Guidi,Heng Dong,Anna Guerra,Alessandro Bazzi,Zhuoming Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种交替残差消除（AREE）算法，用于毫米波通信中的混合波束成形，通过分解问题并迭代消除残差，实现高效解耦和快速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合波束成形在毫米波通信中广泛应用，但模拟和数字预编码器的耦合限制了计算和频谱效率。

Method: 将混合波束成形问题分解为两个低维子问题，通过交替消除残差实现解耦，并采用几何信道SVD算法简化计算。

Result: AREE算法有效解耦模拟和数字预编码器，复杂度低，收敛快，频谱效率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AREE算法为混合波束成形提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid beamforming has been widely employed in mmWave communications such as
vehicular-to-everything (V2X) scenarios, as a compromise between hardware
complexity and spectral efficiency. However, the inherent coupling between
analog and digital precoders in hybrid array architecture significantly limits
the computational and spectral efficiency of existing algorithms. To address
this issue, we propose an alternating residual error elimination (AREE)
algorithm, which decomposes the hybrid beamforming problem into two
low-dimensional subproblems, each exhibiting a favorable matrix structure that
enables effective decoupling of analog and digital precoders from the matrix
product formulation. These subproblems iteratively eliminate each other's
residual errors, driving the original problem toward the optimal hybrid
beamforming performance. The proposed initialization ensures rapid convergence,
while a low-complexity geometric channel SVD algorithm is developed by
transforming the high-dimensional sparse channel into a low-dimensional
equivalent, thereby simplifying the derivation of subproblems. Simulation
results demonstrate that the AREE algorithm effectively decouples analog and
digital precoders with low complexity, achieves fast convergence, and offers
higher spectral efficiency than existing beamforming methods.

*Po-Heng Chou,Ching-Wen Chen,Wan-Jen Huang,Walid Saad,Yu Tsao,Ronald Y. Chang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了毫米波MIMO系统中预编码设计，利用RIS增强传输性能，提出基于DNN的快速码字选择方法，降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统穷举搜索（ES）方法在连续相位偏移下计算复杂且耗时，需要更高效的解决方案以优化系统吞吐量。

Method: 采用排列离散傅里叶变换（DFT）向量设计码本，并开发训练DNN模型以加速码字选择。

Result: 仿真表明，DNN在测试阶段能保持次优频谱效率，适应RIS与终端用户距离变化。

Conclusion: DNN在RIS辅助系统中具有显著潜力，可提升性能并降低计算负担。

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

### [13] [Pronunciation Editing for Finnish Speech using Phonetic Posteriorgrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02115)
*Zirui Li,Lauri Juvela,Mikko Kurimo*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的语音编辑方法PPG2Speech，用于将母语语音编辑为近似第二语言（L2）语音，无需文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏L2语音合成数据集，难以合成低资源语言的L2语音，因此需要一种实用的编辑方法。

Method: 使用Matcha-TTS的流匹配解码器作为主干，结合Classifier-free Guidance和Sway Sampling，通过Phonetic Posteriorgrams（PPGs）编辑单个音素。

Result: 在芬兰语（低资源语言）上验证了方法的有效性，通过客观和主观评估比较了自然度、说话人相似性和编辑效果。

Conclusion: PPG2Speech提供了一种有效的L2语音编辑解决方案，适用于低资源语言。

Abstract: Synthesizing second-language (L2) speech is potentially highly valued for L2
language learning experience and feedback. However, due to the lack of L2
speech synthesis datasets, it is difficult to synthesize L2 speech for
low-resourced languages. In this paper, we provide a practical solution for
editing native speech to approximate L2 speech and present PPG2Speech, a
diffusion-based multispeaker Phonetic-Posteriorgrams-to-Speech model that is
capable of editing a single phoneme without text alignment. We use Matcha-TTS's
flow-matching decoder as the backbone, transforming Phonetic Posteriorgrams
(PPGs) to mel-spectrograms conditioned on external speaker embeddings and
pitch. PPG2Speech strengthens the Matcha-TTS's flow-matching decoder with
Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) and Sway Sampling. We also propose a new
task-specific objective evaluation metric, the Phonetic Aligned Consistency
(PAC), between the edited PPGs and the PPGs extracted from the synthetic speech
for editing effects. We validate the effectiveness of our method on Finnish, a
low-resourced, nearly phonetic language, using approximately 60 hours of data.
We conduct objective and subjective evaluations of our approach to compare its
naturalness, speaker similarity, and editing effectiveness with TTS-based
editing. Our source code is published at
https://github.com/aalto-speech/PPG2Speech.

Result: 在VB-DMD和WSJ0-CHiME3数据集上验证，MSGLA变体表现优于现有算法，尤其在背景噪声抑制方面。

Conclusion: MSGLA框架在语音增强中有效，尤其在噪声抑制方面表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a novel iterative phase estimation framework, termed multi-source
Griffin-Lim algorithm (MSGLA), for speech enhancement (SE) under additive noise
conditions. The core idea is to leverage the ad-hoc consistency constraint of
complex-valued short-time Fourier transform (STFT) spectrograms to address the
sign ambiguity challenge commonly encountered in geometry-based phase
estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a variant of the geometric constraint
framework based on the law of sines and cosines, formulating a new phase
reconstruction algorithm using noise phase estimates. We first validate the
proposed technique through a series of oracle experiments, demonstrating its
effectiveness under ideal conditions. We then evaluate its performance on the
VB-DMD and WSJ0-CHiME3 data sets, and show that the proposed MSGLA variants
match well or slightly outperform existing algorithms, including direct phase
estimation and DNN-based sign prediction, especially in terms of background
noise suppression.

Abstract: We present an open-source system designed for multilingual translation and
speech regeneration, addressing challenges in communication and accessibility
across diverse linguistic contexts. The system integrates Whisper for speech
recognition with Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to identify speaking intervals,
followed by a pipeline of Large Language Models (LLMs). For multilingual
applications, the first LLM segments speech into coherent, complete sentences,
which a second LLM then translates. For speech regeneration, the system uses a
text-to-speech (TTS) module with voice cloning capabilities to replicate the
original speaker's voice, maintaining naturalness and speaker identity.

### [16] [Multi-Utterance Speech Separation and Association Trained on Short Segments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02562)
*Yuzhu Wang,Archontis Politis,Konstantinos Drossos,Tuomas Virtanen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种频率-时间循环神经网络（FTRNN），用于解决深度神经网络（DNN）在语音分离中因训练与推理时长不匹配导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DNN语音分离模型因计算限制需在短片段上训练，但实际应用需处理更长的多说话人录音，导致性能下降。

Method: FTRNN结合全频带模块和子频带模块，分别建模频域和时域依赖关系，无需分段处理长音频。

Result: FTRNN在远超训练时长（21-121秒）的音频上表现鲁棒，且参数轻量（0.9M），避免了分段边界失真。

Conclusion: FTRNN在多说话人语音分离和说话人关联任务中展现出优异的泛化能力，简化了部署流程。

Abstract: Current deep neural network (DNN) based speech separation faces a fundamental
challenge -- while the models need to be trained on short segments due to
computational constraints, real-world applications typically require processing
significantly longer recordings with multiple utterances per speaker than seen
during training. In this paper, we investigate how existing approaches perform
in this challenging scenario and propose a frequency-temporal recurrent neural
network (FTRNN) that effectively bridges this gap. Our FTRNN employs a
full-band module to model frequency dependencies within each time frame and a
sub-band module that models temporal patterns in each frequency band. Despite
being trained on short fixed-length segments of 10 s, our model demonstrates
robust separation when processing signals significantly longer than training
segments (21-121 s) and preserves speaker association across utterance gaps
exceeding those seen during training. Unlike the conventional
segment-separation-stitch paradigm, our lightweight approach (0.9 M parameters)
performs inference on long audio without segmentation, eliminating segment
boundary distortions while simplifying deployment. Experimental results
demonstrate the generalization ability of FTRNN for multi-utterance speech
separation and speaker association.

*Caleb Rascon,Luis Gato-Diaz,Eduardo García-Alarcón*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种多代理并行处理听觉场景分析（MASA）系统，通过任务间反馈循环减少错误，降低响应时间和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性任务流导致响应时间长且对初始任务错误敏感，难以满足低计算资源和高实时性需求的应用场景。

Method: 采用多代理并行处理，任务间引入反馈循环（如分离质量修正定位误差，分类结果降低定位干扰敏感性）。

Result: MASA系统在保持低复杂度的同时，显著减少局部错误并降低响应时间。

Conclusion: MASA系统为听觉场景分析提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案，适用于多种实时应用场景。

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic
environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,
separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a
linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their
location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of
which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario
(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).
However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,
while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to
errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and
computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop
techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives
rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a
small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,
hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this
effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where
the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate
for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to
correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the
localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent
auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,
without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.
The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses
open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent
communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: DeSTA2.5-Audio是一个通用的大型音频语言模型（LALM），通过自生成跨模态对齐策略解决了传统方法中LLM语言能力遗忘的问题，并在多个音频语言基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LALM方法在增强LLM的听觉能力时会导致其原有语言能力的遗忘，因此需要一种新的数据构建策略来平衡两者。

Method: 提出DeSTA策略，通过LLM自生成训练目标，构建大规模任务无关数据集DeSTA-AQA5M（500万样本，7000小时音频）。

Result: DeSTA2.5-Audio在多个音频语言基准测试中达到或接近最优性能，证明了自生成策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 精心设计的数据构建策略对开发通用LALM至关重要，DeSTA为未来研究提供了实用指导。

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种低复杂度的粒子滤波跟踪算法，结合时空反馈，显著提升了动态场景下的语音增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度非线性空间选择性滤波器在静态场景中表现优异，但在动态场景中需要高计算资源的跟踪算法，限制了其在实时应用中的使用。

Method: 采用低复杂度的粒子滤波跟踪算法，并通过时空反馈利用增强的语音信号补偿粒子滤波的局限性。

Result: 在合成数据集上，该方法显著提高了跟踪精度和增强性能；真实录音的听力测试也显示其优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自导向管道在动态场景中表现出色，是资源受限实时语音增强的理想选择。

Abstract: Recent works on deep non-linear spatially selective filters demonstrate
exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight
architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain
this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking
algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on
the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational
overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as
real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a
low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead.
Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback
to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to
compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter.
Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay
between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to
strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings
complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed
self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.

*You Zhang,Andrew Francl,Ruohan Gao,Paul Calamia,Zhiyao Duan,Ishwarya Ananthabhotla*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于感知的HRTF个性化方法，通过优化潜在空间的表示以匹配感知距离，从而提升听觉体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的HRTF个性化方法虽然优化了频谱重建，但忽略了感知兼容性，可能导致听觉体验不佳。

Method: 使用基于听觉的客观感知指标评估传统HRTF表示，并提出一种基于度量损失函数和MMDS监督的方法，将HRTF嵌入感知感知的潜在空间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够生成与感知距离更匹配的HRTF表示，适用于HRTF个性化任务。

Conclusion: 该方法有望改进个性化空间音频的生成，提升听觉体验。

Abstract: Personalized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are essential for
ensuring a realistic auditory experience over headphones, because they take
into account individual anatomical differences that affect listening. Most
machine learning approaches to HRTF personalization rely on a learned
low-dimensional latent space to generate or select custom HRTFs for a listener.
However, these latent representations are typically learned in a manner that
optimizes for spectral reconstruction but not for perceptual compatibility,
meaning they may not necessarily align with perceptual distance. In this work,
we first study whether traditionally learned HRTF representations are well
correlated with perceptual relations using auditory-based objective perceptual
metrics; we then propose a method for explicitly embedding HRTFs into a
perception-informed latent space, leveraging a metric-based loss function and
supervision via Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MMDS). Finally, we demonstrate
the applicability of these learned representations to the task of HRTF
personalization. We suggest that our method has the potential to render
personalized spatial audio, leading to an improved listening experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动信号检测方法的评估多依赖机器学习指标，缺乏声学性能分析，因此需要一种更全面的评估方法。

Method: 通过合成信号的信噪比与检测概率的关系，提出了一种性能分析方法，并用于优化系统训练和建模检测距离。

Result: 该方法提供了系统性能的详细信息，支持训练优化，并能建模检测距离，评估声音环境动态和空间密度。

Conclusion: 该方法为动物声音监测系统的性能分析和优化提供了实用工具，有助于提升监测效果。

Abstract: The accessibility of long-duration recorders, adapted to sometimes demanding
field conditions, has enabled the deployment of extensive animal population
monitoring campaigns through ecoacoustics. The effectiveness of automatic
signal detection methods, increasingly based on neural approaches, is
frequently evaluated solely through machine learning metrics, while acoustic
analysis of performance remains rare. As part of the acoustic monitoring of
Rock Ptarmigan populations, we propose here a simple method for acoustic
analysis of the detection system's performance. The proposed measure is based
on relating the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their probability
of detection. We show how this measure provides information about the system
and allows optimisation of its training. We also show how it enables modelling
of the detection distance, thus offering the possibility of evaluating its
dynamics according to the sound environment and accessing an estimation of the
spatial density of calls.

Motivation: 当前ASV嵌入主要用于区分而非全面表征声音身份，导致其在评估声音克隆系统时存在局限性。

Method: 通过分析ASV嵌入的捕捉能力，识别其不足，并提出U3D指标以补充动态节奏特征的评估。

Result: 发现ASV嵌入主要关注静态特征，忽略了动态节奏，并提出了U3D作为解决方案。

Conclusion: U3D指标有助于更全面地评估声音身份一致性，特别是在声音克隆系统中。

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用音频表示在音乐信息检索中表现良好，但在智能音乐制作中因缺乏对音频效果（Fx）的乐器级别理解而受限。

Method: 采用对比学习框架，引入提取器机制，将混合级别的音频效果嵌入转换为乐器级别的嵌入。

Result: 在检索和音频效果参数匹配任务中，Fx-Encoder++优于混合级别方法，并能提取乐器级别的效果表示。

Conclusion: Fx-Encoder++填补了智能音乐制作系统中乐器级别音频效果理解的空白。

Abstract: General-purpose audio representations have proven effective across diverse
music information retrieval applications, yet their utility in intelligent
music production remains limited by insufficient understanding of audio effects
(Fx). Although previous approaches have emphasized audio effects analysis at
the mixture level, this focus falls short for tasks demanding instrument-wise
audio effects understanding, such as automatic mixing. In this work, we present
Fx-Encoder++, a novel model designed to extract instrument-wise audio effects
representations from music mixtures. Our approach leverages a contrastive
learning framework and introduces an "extractor" mechanism that, when provided
with instrument queries (audio or text), transforms mixture-level audio effects
embeddings into instrument-wise audio effects embeddings. We evaluated our
model across retrieval and audio effects parameter matching tasks, testing its
performance across a diverse range of instruments. The results demonstrate that
Fx-Encoder++ outperforms previous approaches at mixture level and show a novel
ability to extract effects representation instrument-wise, addressing a
critical capability gap in intelligent music production systems.

Result: 在WSJ0-QUT和VoiceBank-DEMAND数据集上，性能优于监督和非监督基线方法，且对领域偏移更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 新方法在语音增强任务中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We explore unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models as
expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

Conclusion: 研究强调了对抗性扰动防御的不足，呼吁开发更鲁棒的解决方案以应对VC带来的安全和隐私风险。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and
security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

Conclusion: ASDA在音频任务中表现出色，为更广泛的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio
tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

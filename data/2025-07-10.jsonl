However, a limitation is that a\npronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech\nrecognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation\nlexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being\ntreated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a\nspeech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a\ngrapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model.\nTo jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic\napproximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM\n(expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance\nparticularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Based on the\nWhistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are\nconducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of\nphoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5\\% error rate\nreductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword\nor full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain\nadaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms\nthe standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the\nG2P model by 9% error rate reductions. To facilitate reproducibility and\nencourage further exploration in this field, we open-source the JSA-SPG\ntraining code and complete pipeline."}

MTSE systems are expected to perform well even when one of the\nmodalities is unavailable. In practice, the systems often suffer from modality\ndominance, where one of the modalities outweighs the others, thereby limiting\nrobustness. Our study investigates training strategies and the effect of\narchitectural choices, particularly the normalization layers, in yielding a\nrobust MTSE system in both non-causal and causal configurations. In particular,\nwe propose the use of modality dropout training (MDT) as a superior strategy to\nstandard and multi-task training (MTT) strategies. Experiments conducted on\ntwo-speaker mixtures from the LRS3 dataset show the MDT strategy to be\neffective irrespective of the employed normalization layer.

A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a\nmicrophone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase\ntransform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone\npairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of\nmicrophone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of\nmicrophone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently\na more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs\nby computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT\nfunction reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on\nthe TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT\nfunctions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral\ndensities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we\nincrease the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs\ncomputed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps.

Existing automatic\nsinging annotation (ASA) methods, however, primarily tackle isolated aspects of\nthe annotation pipeline. To address this fundamental challenge, we present\nSTARS, which is, to our knowledge, the first unified framework that\nsimultaneously addresses singing transcription, alignment, and refined style\nannotation. Our framework delivers comprehensive multi-level annotations\nencompassing: (1) precise phoneme-audio alignment, (2) robust note\ntranscription and temporal localization, (3) expressive vocal technique\nidentification, and (4) global stylistic characterization including emotion and\npace. The proposed architecture employs hierarchical acoustic feature\nprocessing across frame, word, phoneme, note, and sentence levels. The novel\nnon-autoregressive local acoustic encoders enable structured hierarchical\nrepresentation learning. Experimental validation confirms the framework's\nsuperior performance across multiple evaluation dimensions compared to existing\nannotation approaches. Furthermore, applications in SVS training demonstrate\nthat models utilizing STARS-annotated data achieve significantly enhanced\nperceptual naturalness and precise style control. This work not only overcomes\ncritical scalability challenges in the creation of singing datasets but also\npioneers new methodologies for controllable singing voice synthesis.

PINNs have\ndemonstrated promising performance in sound field interpolation by combining\nthe powerful modeling capability of neural networks and the physical principles\nof sound propagation. In room acoustics, PINNs have typically been trained to\nrepresent the sound pressure measured by omnidirectional microphones where the\nwave equation or its frequency-domain counterpart, i.e., the Helmholtz\nequation, is leveraged. Meanwhile, FOA RIRs additionally provide spatial\ncharacteristics and are useful for immersive audio generation with a wide range\nof applications. In this paper, we extend the PINN framework to model FOA RIRs.\nWe derive two physics-informed priors for FOA RIRs based on the correspondence\nbetween the particle velocity and the (X, Y, Z)-channels of FOA. These priors\nassociate the predicted W-channel and other channels through their partial\nderivatives and impose the physically feasible relationship on the four\nchannels. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method\ncompared with a neural network without the physics-informed prior."}

Utilizing the PhysioNet2022 dataset, a custom heart\ncycle normalization method tailored to individual cardiac rhythms is\nintroduced. The findings indicate the following AUROC values: the CNN model\nwith fixed-length windowing achieves 79.5%, the CNN model with heart cycle\nnormalization scores 75.4%, the BEATs transformer with fixed-length windowing\nachieves 65.7%, and the BEATs transformer with heart cycle normalization\nresults in 70.1%.\n  The findings indicate that physiological signal constraints, especially those\nintroduced by different normalization strategies, have a substantial impact on\nmodel performance. The research provides evidence-based guidelines for\narchitecture selection in clinical settings, emphasizing the need for a balance\nbetween accuracy and computational efficiency.

A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a\nmicrophone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase\ntransform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone\npairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of\nmicrophone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of\nmicrophone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently\na more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs\nby computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT\nfunction reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on\nthe TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT\nfunctions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral\ndensities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we\nincrease the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs\ncomputed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals\nrecorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially\ndistributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in\nterms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error.\nExperimental results for different source and microphone configurations and\nthree reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering\nmultiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation\naccuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely\non a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position\nestimation."}

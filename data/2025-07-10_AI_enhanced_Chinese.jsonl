However, a limitation is that a\npronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech\nrecognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation\nlexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being\ntreated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a\nspeech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a\ngrapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model.\nTo jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic\napproximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM\n(expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance\nparticularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Based on the\nWhistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are\nconducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of\nphoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5\\% error rate\nreductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword\nor full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain\nadaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms\nthe standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the\nG2P model by 9% error rate reductions.

MTSE systems are expected to perform well even when one of the\nmodalities is unavailable. In practice, the systems often suffer from modality\ndominance, where one of the modalities outweighs the others, thereby limiting\nrobustness.

In particular,\nwe propose the use of modality dropout training (MDT) as a superior strategy to\nstandard and multi-task training (MTT) strategies. Experiments conducted on\ntwo-speaker mixtures from the LRS3 dataset show the MDT strategy to be\neffective irrespective of the employed normalization layer. In contrast, the\nmodels trained with the standard and MTT strategies are susceptible to modality\ndominance, and their performance depends on the chosen normalization layer.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that the system trained with MDT strategy is\nrobust to using extracted speech as the enrollment signal, highlighting its\npotential applicability in scenarios where the target speaker is not enrolled.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u63d0\u53d6\uff08MTSE\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u4e22\u5f03\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08MDT\uff09\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001TSE\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u6001\u4e22\u5f03\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08MDT\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08MTT\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMDT\u7b56\u7565\u5728LRS3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u97f3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6ce8\u518c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MDT\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MTSE\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on\nthe TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT\nfunctions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral\ndensities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we\nincrease the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs\ncomputed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals\nrecorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially\ndistributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in\nterms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error.\nExperimental results for different source and microphone configurations and\nthree reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering\nmultiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation\naccuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely\non a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position\nestimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591aCPSD\u5e73\u5747\u7684GCC-PHAT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u5347TDOA\u548c\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5355CPSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6df7\u54cd\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u57fa\u4e8eTDOA\u7684\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GCC-PHAT\u548cMST\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355CPSD\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u591a\u4e2aCPSD\u8ba1\u7b97GCC-PHAT\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u95f4\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684CPSD\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591aCPSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728TDOA\u548c2D\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355CPSD\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591aCPSD\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6df7\u54cd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The proposed architecture employs hierarchical acoustic feature\nprocessing across frame, word, phoneme, note, and sentence levels. The novel\nnon-autoregressive local acoustic encoders enable structured hierarchical\nrepresentation learning.

Recent research focuses on designing efficient PB\narchitectures that can support numerous antennas. In this context, PBs equipped\nwith intelligent surfaces present a promising approach, enabling physically\nlarge, reconfigurable arrays. Motivated by these advantages, this work aims to\nminimize the power consumption of a PB equipped with a passive intelligent\ntransmitting surface (ITS) and a collocated digital beamforming-based feeder to\ncharge multiple single-antenna devices. To model the PB's power consumption\naccurately, we consider power amplifiers nonlinearities, ITS control power, and\nfeeder-to-ITS air interface losses. The resulting optimization problem is\nhighly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the high-power amplifier (HPA), the\nreceived power constraints at the devices, and the unit-modulus constraint\nimposed by the phase shifter configuration of the ITS. To tackle this issue, we\napply successive convex approximation (SCA) to iteratively solve convex\nsubproblems that jointly optimize the digital precoder and phase configuration.\nGiven SCA's sensitivity to initialization, we propose an algorithm that ensures\ninitialization feasibility while balancing convergence speed and solution\nquality. We compare the proposed ITS-equipped PB's power consumption against\nbenchmark architectures featuring digital and hybrid analog-digital\nbeamforming.

Based on extensive simulations, the proposed\nEG-CsiNet can robustly enhance the generalizability in unseen environments\ncompared to the state-of-the-art, especially in challenging conditions with a\nsingle source environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "EG-CsiNet\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bCSI\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e2dCSI\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728FDD\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684CSI\u53cd\u9988\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u5bb9\u91cf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEG-CsiNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cEG-CsiNet\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5355\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EG-CsiNet\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CSI\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aFDD\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Due to the performance limitations of components such as\ngain controllers and analog-to-digital converters in SAR receivers, high-power\ninterference can easily cause saturation of the SAR receiver, resulting in\nnonlinear distortion of the interfered echoes, which are distorted in both the\ntime domain and frequency domain. Some scholars have analyzed the impact of SAR\nreceiver saturation on target echoes through simulations. However, the\nsaturation function has non-smooth characteristics, making it difficult to\nconduct accurate analysis using traditional analytical methods. Current related\nstudies have approximated and analyzed the saturation function based on the\nhyperbolic tangent function, but there are approximation errors. Therefore,\nthis paper proposes a saturation interference analysis model based on Bessel\nfunctions, and verifies the accuracy of the proposed saturation interference\nanalysis model by simulating and comparing it with the traditional saturation\nmodel based on smooth function approximation.

Traditional beamforming methods for\nacoustic mapping, while interpretable, often rely on iterative solvers that can\nbe computationally intensive and sensitive to acoustic variability. On the\nother hand, recent supervised deep learning approaches offer feedforward speed\nand robustness but require large labeled datasets and lack interpretability.\nDespite their strengths, both methods struggle to consistently generalize\nacross diverse acoustic setups and array configurations, limiting their broader\napplicability. We introduce the Latent Acoustic Mapping (LAM) model, a\nself-supervised framework that bridges the interpretability of traditional\nmethods with the adaptability and efficiency of deep learning methods. LAM\ngenerates high-resolution acoustic maps, adapts to varying acoustic conditions,\nand operates efficiently across different microphone arrays. We assess its\nrobustness on DoAE using the LOCATA and STARSS benchmarks. LAM achieves\ncomparable or superior localization performance to existing supervised methods.\nAdditionally, we show that LAM's acoustic maps can serve as effective features\nfor supervised models, further enhancing DoAE accuracy and underscoring its\npotential to advance adaptive, high-performance sound localization systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u6620\u5c04\uff08LAM\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u58f0\u5b66\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u4e14\u5bf9\u58f0\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u9635\u5217\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LAM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u58f0\u5b66\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u58f0\u5b66\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u9635\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728LOCATA\u548cSTARSS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLAM\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5176\u58f0\u5b66\u6620\u5c04\u8fd8\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "LAM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u58f0\u97f3\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

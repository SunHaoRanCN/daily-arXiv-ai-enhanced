The imaging system employs four transmitters, three of which emit\nspatially and temporally incoherent noise signals, while the fourth transmits a\nknown linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulsed signal. The spatial incoherence\nof the noise signals enables sampling of the 2D spatial Fourier spectrum of the\nscene from which two-dimensional cross-range (azimuth and elevation) images can\nbe formed via interferometric processing. Simultaneously, the LFM signal\nenables high-resolution downrange imaging through matched filtering. The\nreceived signals consist of a superposition of the noise sources and the known\npulse allowing for joint recovery of all three dimensions. We describe the\nsystem architecture and waveform design, and demonstrate the imaging technique\nusing both simulations with a linear array and experimental data from a 38 GHz\nactive incoherent millimeter-wave imaging system with 23-element randomized\narray. Results show the reconstruction of targets in three dimensions."}

In the proposed framework, RISs\nsimultaneously redirect beams toward a desired region of interest (ROI). The\ninterference of these beams forms spatially diverse speckle patterns that carry\ninformation about the entire ROI. As a result, this method can take advantage\nof the benefits of both random patterns and spotlight imaging. Since the\nspeckle pattern is formed by directive beams (instead of random patterns\ntypically used in computational imaging), this approach results in a higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced clutter. In contrast to raster\nscanning, which requires the number of measurements to be at least equal to the\nnumber of unknowns, our proposed approach follows a computational imaging\nframework and can obtain high-quality images even when only a few measurements\nare taken. Using numerical simulation, we demonstrate this method's\ncapabilities and contrast it against other conventional techniques. The\nproposed imaging approach can be applied to security screening, wireless user\ntracking, and activity recognition."}

First, our\nproposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts\nfrom vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to\ngenerate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations\nof crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these\nfields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow\ncurrents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is\nquantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian\nand computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd\nsemantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on\ncrowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity\nmmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the\nunderlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating\nstrong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow\nsplit ratios.

In this paper, we explore reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (RIS)-assisted ISAC systems for IIoT in the coexistence of near-field\nand far-field regions.

Recent results from audio (music and speech) quality assessment\nas well as image similarity have shown that deep learning is able to produce\nembeddings that align well with human perception while being largely free from\nthese constraints. Although the existing human-rated timbre similarity data is\nnot large enough to train deep neural networks (2,614 pairwise ratings on 334\naudio samples), it can serve as test-only data for audio models. In this paper,\nwe introduce metrics to assess the alignment of diverse audio representations\nwith human judgments of timbre similarity by comparing both the absolute values\nand the rankings of embedding distances to human similarity ratings. Our\nevaluation involves three signal-processing-based representations, twelve\nrepresentations extracted from pre-trained models, and three representations\nextracted from a novel sound matching model. Among them, the style embeddings\ninspired by image style transfer, extracted from the CLAP model and the sound\nmatching model, remarkably outperform the others, showing their potential in\nmodeling timbre similarity."}

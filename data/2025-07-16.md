### [1] [A Leap-on-Success Exhaustive Search Method to Find Optimal Robust Minimum Redundancy Arrays (RMRAs): New Array Configurations for Sensor Counts 11 to 20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10706)
*Pradyumna Kunchala,Ashish Patwari*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对11至15个传感器的新型最优RMRA配置，使用Leap-on-Success算法高效搜索，并验证了其鲁棒性。同时报告了16至20个传感器的近最优配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有TFRAs在单传感器故障时的脆弱性问题，并优化RMRA的设计以实现最大孔径。

Method: 采用Leap-on-Success穷举搜索算法，减少计算量，并在找到最优解时终止搜索。

Result: 发现了11至15个传感器的最优RMRA配置，验证了其鲁棒性，并提供了16至20个传感器的近最优配置。

Conclusion: 本文不仅推进了RMRA设计的最新技术，还提出了一种高效的搜索方法，适用于未来更大规模阵列的优化。

Abstract: Two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRAs) are designed to maintain accurate
direction estimation even in the event of a single sensor failure, leveraging
the deliberate coarray redundancy infused into their design. Robust Minimum
Redundancy Arrays (RMRAs), a specialized class of TFRAs, optimize this
redundancy to achieve the maximum possible aperture for a given number of
sensors. However, finding optimal RMRA configurations is an NP-hard problem,
with prior research reporting optimal solutions only for arrays of up to ten
sensors. This paper presents newly discovered optimal RMRA configurations for
array sizes 11 to 15, identified using a novel Leap-on-Success exhaustive
search algorithm that efficiently reduces computational effort by terminating
the search upon locating optimal solutions. The robustness of these arrays was
validated under all single-element failure scenarios using MATLAB simulations,
confirming their superior resilience compared to some existing TFRAs vulnerable
to failures at specific sensor positions. Furthermore, near-optimal
configurations for array sizes 16 to 20 are also reported, highlighting the
potential applicability of the proposed method for larger array designs given
sufficient computational resources. This work not only advances the
state-of-the-art in RMRA design but also introduces an effective search
methodology that can be leveraged for future explorations in array
configuration optimization.

### [2] [Waterfilling at the Edge: Optimal Percentile Resource Allocation via Risk-Averse Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10838)
*Gokberk Yaylali,Ahmad Ali Khan,Dionysios S. Kalogerias*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于条件风险价值（CVaR）的资源分配方法，用于优化多终端AWGN信道中的边缘终端传输速率，解决了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于效用的方法（如最小速率、总和速率和比例公平）在边缘终端速率优化中表现不佳，缺乏严谨性和可解释性。

Method: 采用CVaR作为风险度量，建立了其与SLαQ效用的等价关系，提出了精确的凸优化问题重构，并通过拉格朗日对偶性给出了参数化的闭式解。

Result: 提出了一种低复杂度的对偶次梯度下降算法，确保全局最优资源分配，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在边缘终端速率优化中表现出色，提供了精确、可解释且高效的资源分配策略。

Abstract: We address deterministic resource allocation in point-to-point multi-terminal
AWGN channels without inter-terminal interference, with particular focus on
optimizing quantile transmission rates for cell-edge terminal service.
Classical utility-based approaches -- such as minimum rate, sumrate, and
proportional fairness -- are either overconservative, or inappropriate, or do
not provide a rigorous and/or interpretable foundation for fair rate
optimization at the edge. To overcome these challenges, we employ Conditional
Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a popular coherent risk measure, and establish its
equivalence with the sum-least-$\alpha$th-quantile (SL$\alpha$Q) utility. This
connection enables an exact convex reformulation of the SL$\alpha$Q
maximization problem, facilitating analytical tractability and precise and
interpretable control over cell-edge terminal performance. Utilizing Lagrangian
duality, we provide (for the first time) parameterized closed-form solutions
for the optimal resource policy -- which is of waterfilling-type -- as well as
the associated (auxiliary) Value-at-Risk variable. We further develop a novel
inexact dual subgradient descent algorithm of minimal complexity to determine
globally optimal resource policies, and we rigorously establish its
convergence. The resulting edge waterfilling algorithm iteratively and
efficiently allocates resources while explicitly ensuring transmission rate
fairness across (cell-edge) terminals. Several (even large-scale) numerical
experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for enabling
robust quantile rate optimization at the edge.

### [3] [Dual RIS-Assisted Monostatic L-Band Radar Target Detection in NLoS Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11036)
*Salman Liaquat,Ijaz Haider Naqvi,Nor Muzlifah Mahyuddin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了双RIS辅助雷达在NLoS场景下的SNR性能，证明其优于单RIS系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单RIS辅助雷达在复杂障碍物场景中无法覆盖目标的问题。

Method: 推导双RIS配置下雷达接收功率的表达式，分析RIS数量、单元数量和位置选择对性能的影响。

Result: 双RIS系统在适当条件下（如RIS尺寸和位置优化）能显著提升SNR和目标定位精度。

Conclusion: 双RIS辅助雷达系统在NLoS场景中性能优于单RIS系统，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: The use of a single Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) to boost the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the radar offers significant improvement in
detecting targets, especially in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. However,
there are scenarios where no path exists between the radar and the target, even
with a single RIS-assisted radar, due to other present obstacles. This paper
derives an expression for SNR in target detection scenarios where dual RISs
assist a monostatic radar in NLoS situations. We calculate the power received
at the radar through a dual RIS configuration. We show that the SNR performance
of RIS-assisted radars can improve with known locations of the radar and RISs.
Our results demonstrate that the required accuracy in target localization can
be achieved by controlling the number of RISs, the number of unit cells in each
RIS, and properly selecting the locations of RISs to cover the desired region.
The performance of dual RIS-assisted radar systems can surpass that of single
RIS-assisted radar systems under favourable alignment and sufficiently large
RIS sizes.

### [4] [Optimizing Fluid Antenna Configurations for Constructive Interference Precoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11093)
*Wenxuan Sun,Mingjie Shao,Luteng Zhu,Yao Ge,Tong Zhang,Zhi Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于流体天线系统（FAS）和构造干扰预编码（CI）的多用户MIMO通信方法，旨在最小化符号错误概率（SEP），并通过低复杂度算法实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定天线阵列在多用户MIMO通信中存在传播条件限制，FAS通过动态调整天线位置提供更好的传播性能，但如何联合优化SEP和CI预编码尚未解决。

Method: 将SEP最小化问题转化为安全裕度最大化问题，并采用平滑技术和块坐标下降（BCD）算法进行低复杂度优化。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在降低误码率（BER）方面优于固定天线阵列和现有粒子群优化（PSO）设计的FAS，且计算复杂度显著低于PSO。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多用户MIMO通信中有效提升了性能，同时保持了低计算复杂度，为FAS的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a new physical-layer concept to
provide enhanced propagation conditions for multiuser multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) communications over conventional fixed arrays. This work
focuses on minimizing the maximum symbol error probability (SEP) under $M$-ary
phase shift keying (MPSK) signaling in a multiuser downlink equipped with FAS,
where each antenna moves within nonoverlapping intervals. This specific problem
of joint SEP minimization with FAS and constructive interference (CI) precoding
has not been previously addressed. The resulting problem turns out to be a
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization challenge. We transform the SEP
minimization problem into a safety margin maximization problem in constructive
interference precoding. Then, we customize a smoothing technique and a block
coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, with emphasis on low computational
complexity. Simulation results show that our approach can reduce bit error rate
(BER) compared to both the fixed arrays and FAS designed by existing particle
swarm optimization (PSO). Also, our approach shows attractively low
computational complexity compared to PSO benchmarks.

### [5] [Fairness-Aware Secure Integrated Sensing and Communications with Fractional Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11224)
*Ali Khandan Boroujeni,Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu,Stefan Köpsell,Ghazal Bagheri,Rafael F. Schaefer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型安全集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统，通过优化问题最大化保密率，并引入熵正则化公平性指标，采用加速二次变换方法解决子问题，验证了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一个同时服务多个通信用户和目标的ISAC系统，平衡通信与感知需求，并确保资源分配的公平性和安全性。

Method: 提出优化问题最大化保密率，引入熵正则化公平性指标，采用加速二次变换（QT）方法迭代解决子问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，系统在平均保密率、平均数据速率和波束增益方面均有性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效优化了ISAC系统的资源分配，确保了安全性和公平性。

Abstract: We propose a novel secure integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system
designed to serve multiple communication users (CUs) and targets. To that end,
we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the secrecy rate under
constraints balancing both communication and sensing requirements. To enhance
fairness among users, an entropy-regularized fairness metric is introduced
within the problem framework. We then propose a solution employing an
accelerated quadratic transform (QT) with a non-homogeneous bound to
iteratively solve two subproblems, thereby effectively optimizing the overall
objective. This approach ensures robust security and fairness in resource
allocation for ISAC systems. Finally, simulation results verify the performance
gains in terms of average secrecy rate, average data rate, and beam gain.

### [6] [Fast and Efficient Implementation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation for the Linear Regression with Gaussian Model Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11249)
*Ruohai Guo,Jiang Zhu,Xing Jiang,Fengzhong Qu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文扩展了随机变量测量矩阵的线性回归模型分析，证明了MLE问题的凸性和强对偶性，并提出了一种快速统一的GRV-ML算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机测量矩阵均值秩不足时的线性回归模型，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过理论分析证明MLE问题的凸性和强对偶性，并提出GRV-ML算法处理欠定和超定系统。

Result: 数值模拟验证了理论发现，表明随机性在欠定情况下可能有益于估计。

Conclusion: 论文扩展了随机测量矩阵的理论框架，并提供了高效的GRV-ML算法。

Abstract: The linear regression model with a random variable (RV) measurement matrix,
where the mean of the random measurement matrix has full column rank, has been
extensively studied. In particular, the quasiconvexity of the maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) problem was established, and the corresponding
Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) was derived, leading to the development of an efficient
bisection-based algorithm known as RV-ML. In contrast, this work extends the
analysis to both overdetermined and underdetermined cases, allowing the mean of
the random measurement matrix to be rank-deficient. A remarkable contribution
is the proof that the equivalent MLE problem is convex and satisfies strong
duality, strengthening previous quasiconvexity results. Moreover, it is shown
that in underdetermined scenarios, the randomness in the measurement matrix can
be beneficial for estimation under certain conditions. In addition, a fast and
unified implementation of the MLE solution, referred to as generalized RV-ML
(GRV-ML), is proposed, which handles a more general case including both
underdetermined and overdetermined systems. Extensive numerical simulations are
provided to validate the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 协调无人机群通过雷达干涉测量可实现高精度实时地球观测，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with radar imaging sensors
has revolutionized the monitoring of dynamic and local Earth surface processes
by enabling high-resolution and cost-effective remote sensing. This paper
investigates the optimization of the sensing accuracy of a UAV swarm deployed
to perform multi-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)
sensing. In conventional single-baseline InSAR systems, only one synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) antenna pair acquires two SAR images from two distinct
angles to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) of the target area. However,
multi-baseline InSAR extends this concept by aggregating multiple acquisitions
from different angles, thus, significantly enhancing the vertical accuracy of
the DEM. The heavy computations required for this process are performed on the
ground and, therefore, the radar data is transmitted in real time to a ground
station (GS) via a frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) air-to-ground
backhaul link. This work focuses on improving the sensing precision by
minimizing the height error of the averaged DEM while simultaneously ensuring
sensing and communication quality-of-service (QoS). To this end, the UAV
formation, velocity, and communication power allocation are jointly optimized
using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Our approach is benchmarked against
established optimization methods, including genetic algorithms (GAs), simulated
annealing (SA), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. Numerical
results show that the proposed solution outperforms these baseline schemes and
achieves sub-decimeter vertical accuracy in several scenarios. These findings
underline the potential of coordinated UAV swarms for delivering high-precision
and real-time Earth observations through radar interferometry.

### [8] [Sparse Regression Codes exploit Multi-User Diversity without CSI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11383)
*V S V Sandeep,Sai Dinesh Kancharana,Arun Pachai Kannu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了多接收天线非相干平坦衰落信道中的稀疏回归码（SPARC），提出了一种新型实用解码器MLMP，通过部分最大似然度量贪婪地找到用户码字的支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多用户场景下非相干信道中的稀疏回归码性能，解决传统贪婪算法在高码率下的性能问题。

Method: 提出最大似然匹配追踪（MLMP）解码器，作为逐次组合能量检测器工作，并改进高码率下的性能。

Result: 短块长度研究表明，即使无信道状态信息，SPARC与MLMP解码器在某些场景下实现多用户分集，性能优于传统稀疏恢复算法和基于导频的极坐标码传输。

Conclusion: SPARC与MLMP解码器在多用户非相干信道中表现优异，优于传统方法。

Abstract: We study sparse regression codes (SPARC) for multiple access channels with
multiple receive antennas, in non-coherent flat fading channels. We propose a
novel practical decoder, referred to as maximum likelihood matching pursuit
(MLMP), which greedily finds the support of the codewords of users with partial
maximum likelihood metrics. As opposed to the conventional
successive-cancellation based greedy algorithms, MLMP works as a
successive-combining energy detector. We also propose MLMP modifications to
improve the performance at high code rates. Our studies in short block lengths
show that, even without any channel state information, SPARC with MLMP decoder
achieves multi-user diversity in some scenarios, giving better error
performance with multiple users than that of the corresponding single-user
case. We also show that SPARC with MLMP performs better than conventional
sparse recovery algorithms and pilot-aided transmissions with polar codes.

### [9] [Joint Power Allocation and Reflecting-Element Activation for Energy Efficiency Maximization in IRS-Aided Communications Under CSI Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11413)
*Christos N. Efrem,Ioannis Krikidis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了在智能反射面（IRS）辅助的通信系统中，通过联合功率分配和反射单元（RE）激活来最大化能量效率（EE），考虑了信道状态信息（CSI）的不完美性。提出了两种算法：交替优化（AO）和分支定界（B&B），均无需外部优化求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IRS辅助的通信系统中，如何高效分配功率并激活反射单元以最大化能量效率，同时处理CSI不完美性是一个关键问题。

Method: 提出了两种算法：1）基于Lambert W函数和动态规划的AO方法，复杂度低但次优；2）以AO为子程序的B&B方法，保证全局最优。

Result: 数值结果表明，两种算法优于基线方案，AO在多数情况下接近最优，B&B平均计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在能量效率优化中表现优异，AO适用于低复杂度需求，B&B适用于全局最优需求。

Abstract: We study the joint power allocation and reflecting element (RE) activation to
maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in communication systems assisted by an
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), taking into account imperfections in
channel state information (CSI). The robust optimization problem is mixed
integer, i.e., the optimization variables are continuous (transmit power) and
discrete (binary states of REs). In order to solve this challenging problem we
develop two algorithms. The first one is an alternating optimization (AO)
method that attains a suboptimal solution with low complexity, based on the
Lambert W function and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The second one is
a branch-and-bound (B&B) method that uses AO as its subroutine and is formally
guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal solution. Both algorithms do not
require any external optimization solver for their implementation. Furthermore,
numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline
schemes, AO achieves near-optimal performance in most cases, and B&B has low
computational complexity on average.

*Xinmeng Luan,Mirco Pezzoli,Fabio Antonacci,Augusto Sarti*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于迁移学习的近场声全息声源重建框架，通过物理信息适应实现不同声源类型的模型迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统数据驱动模型在不同声源类型上泛化能力不足的问题，利用物理信息提升迁移效果。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 在大数据集上预训练复数卷积神经网络；2) 基于基尔霍夫-亥姆霍兹积分的单样本物理信息微调。

Result: 从矩形板数据集迁移到小提琴面板数据集时，重建精度优于预训练模型，与C-ESM相当；成功模式下微调模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 该框架通过物理信息微调实现了跨声源类型的有效迁移，显著提升了重建精度。

Abstract: We propose a transfer learning framework for sound source reconstruction in
Near-field Acoustic Holography (NAH), which adapts a well-trained data-driven
model from one type of sound source to another using a physics-informed
procedure. The framework comprises two stages: (1) supervised pre-training of a
complex-valued convolutional neural network (CV-CNN) on a large dataset, and
(2) purely physics-informed fine-tuning on a single data sample based on the
Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral. This method follows the principles of transfer
learning by enabling generalization across different datasets through
physics-informed adaptation. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by
transferring a pre-trained model from a rectangular plate dataset to a violin
top plate dataset, where it shows improved reconstruction accuracy compared to
the pre-trained model and delivers performance comparable to that of
Compressive-Equivalent Source Method (C-ESM). Furthermore, for successful
modes, the fine-tuned model outperforms both the pre-trained model and C-ESM in
accuracy.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for binaural reproduction from arbitrary
microphone arrays, based on array-aware optimization of Ambisonics encoding
through Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) pre-processing. The proposed
approach integrates array-specific information into the HRTF processing
pipeline, leading to improved spatial accuracy in binaural rendering. Objective
evaluations demonstrate superior performance under simulated wearable-array and
head rotations compared to conventional Ambisonics encoding method. A listening
experiment further confirms that the method achieves significantly higher
perceptual ratings in both timbre and spatial quality. Fully compatible with
standard Ambisonics, the proposed method offers a practical solution for
spatial audio rendering in applications such as virtual reality, augmented

Abstract: Motivation. Phonocardiography can give access to the fetal heart rate as well
as direct heart sound data, and is entirely passive, using no radiation of any
kind. Approach. We discuss the currently available methods for fetal heart
sound detection and heart rate estimation and compare them using a common
benchmarking platform and a pre-selected testing dataset. Compared to previous
reviews, we evaluated the discussed methods in a standardized manner for a fair
comparison. Our tests included tolerance-based detection accuracy, error rates
for label insertions, deletions, and substitutions, and statistical measures
for heart rate mean square error. Results. Based on our results, there is no
definite best method that can achieve the highest scores in all of the tests,
and simpler methods could perform comparably to more complex ones. The best
model for first heart sound detection achieved 97.6% F1-score, 97.4% positive
predictive value, and 12.2+-8.0 ms mean absolute error. In terms of second
heart sound detection the best model had 91.4% F1-score, 91.3% positive
predictive value, and 17.3+-12.2 ms mean absolute error. For fetal heart rate a
0.644 mean square error was achieved by the best method. Significance. Our main
conclusion is that further standardization is required in fetal heart rate and
heart sound detection method evaluation. The tests and algorithm
implementations are openly available at:

Abstract: In speech quality estimation for speech enhancement (SE) systems, subjective
listening tests so far are considered as the gold standard. This should be even
more true considering the large influx of new generative or hybrid methods into
the field, revealing issues of some objective metrics. Efforts such as the
Interspeech 2025 URGENT Speech Enhancement Challenge also involving non-English
datasets add the aspect of multilinguality to the testing procedure. In this
paper, we provide a brief recap of the ITU-T P.808 crowdsourced subjective
listening test method. A first novel contribution is our proposed process of
localizing both text and audio components of Naderi and Cutler's implementation
of crowdsourced subjective absolute category rating (ACR) listening tests
involving text-to-speech (TTS). Further, we provide surprising analyses of and
insights into URGENT Challenge results, tackling the reliability of (P.808) ACR
subjective testing as gold standard in the age of generative AI. Particularly,
it seems that for generative SE methods, subjective (ACR MOS) and objective
(DNSMOS, NISQA) reference-free metrics should be accompanied by objective phone
fidelity metrics to reliably detect hallucinations. Finally, in the accepted
version, we will release our localization scripts and methods for easy
deployment for new multilingual speech enhancement subjective evaluations
according to ITU-T P.808.

### [14] [Towards Reliable Objective Evaluation Metrics for Generative Singing Voice Separation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11427)
*Paul A. Bereuter,Benjamin Stahl,Mark D. Plumbley,Alois Sontacchi*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 传统BSS-Eval指标在评估生成式音频分离模型时存在局限性，本文通过听力测试和客观指标分析，提出更适合的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BSS-Eval指标对非线性生成模型评估不可靠，需寻找更有效的评估方法。

Method: 通过听力测试（DMOS）和客观指标（如嵌入空间MSE）分析，评估判别式和生成式模型。

Result: 嵌入空间指标（如Music2Latent和MERT-L12）与DMOS相关性更高，优于传统BSS-Eval。

Conclusion: BSS-Eval不适用于生成式模型，需验证替代指标以优化歌唱声音分离评估。

Abstract: Traditional Blind Source Separation Evaluation (BSS-Eval) metrics were
originally designed to evaluate linear audio source separation models based on
methods such as time-frequency masking. However, recent generative models may
introduce nonlinear relationships between the separated and reference signals,
limiting the reliability of these metrics for objective evaluation. To address
this issue, we conduct a Degradation Category Rating listening test and analyze
correlations between the obtained degradation mean opinion scores (DMOS) and a
set of objective audio quality metrics for the task of singing voice
separation. We evaluate three state-of-the-art discriminative models and two
new competitive generative models. For both discriminative and generative
models, intrusive embedding-based metrics show higher correlations with DMOS
than conventional intrusive metrics such as BSS-Eval. For discriminative
models, the highest correlation is achieved by the MSE computed on Music2Latent
embeddings. When it comes to the evaluation of generative models, the strongest
correlations are evident for the multi-resolution STFT loss and the MSE
calculated on MERT-L12 embeddings, with the latter also providing the most
balanced correlation across both model types. Our results highlight the
limitations of BSS-Eval metrics for evaluating generative singing voice
separation models and emphasize the need for careful selection and validation
of alternative evaluation metrics for the task of singing voice separation.

support these on-the-ground efforts, the community is turning to digital
technology. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology holds great promise
for accelerating language documentation and the creation of educational
resources. However, developing ASR systems for SEN\'{C}OTEN is challenging due
to limited data and significant vocabulary variation from its polysynthetic
structure and stress-driven metathesis. To address these challenges, we propose
an ASR-driven documentation pipeline that leverages augmented speech data from
a text-to-speech (TTS) system and cross-lingual transfer learning with Speech
Foundation Models (SFMs). An n-gram language model is also incorporated via
shallow fusion or n-best restoring to maximize the use of available data.
Experiments on the SEN\'{C}OTEN dataset show a word error rate (WER) of 19.34%
and a character error rate (CER) of 5.09% on the test set with a 57.02%
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate. After filtering minor cedilla-related errors, WER
improves to 14.32% (26.48% on unseen words) and CER to 3.45%, demonstrating the
potential of our ASR-driven pipeline to support SEN\'{C}OTEN language
documentation.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效识别特定发音错误，无需依赖语言特定的规则或数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为发音错误检测提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for detecting mispronunciations by
analyzing deviations between a user's original speech and their voice-cloned
counterpart with corrected pronunciation. We hypothesize that regions with
maximal acoustic deviation between the original and cloned utterances indicate
potential mispronunciations. Our method leverages recent advances in voice
cloning to generate a synthetic version of the user's voice with proper
pronunciation, then performs frame-by-frame comparisons to identify problematic
segments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
in pinpointing specific pronunciation errors without requiring predefined
phonetic rules or extensive training data for each target language.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate leveraging cross-attention control for
efficient audio editing within auto-regressive models. Inspired by image
editing methodologies, we develop a Prompt-to-Prompt-like approach that guides
edits through cross and self-attention mechanisms. Integrating a
diffusion-based strategy, influenced by Auffusion, we extend the model's
functionality to support refinement edits, establishing a baseline for
prompt-guided audio editing. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach
by incorporating MUSICGEN, a pre-trained frozen auto-regressive model, and
propose three editing mechanisms, based on Replacement, Reweighting, and
Refinement of the attention scores. We employ commonly-used music-specific
evaluation metrics and a human study, to gauge time-varying controllability,
adherence to global text cues, and overall audio realism. The automatic and
human evaluations indicate that the proposed combination of prompt-to-prompt
guidance with autoregressive generation models significantly outperforms the
diffusion-based baseline in terms of melody, dynamics, and tempo of the
generated audio. Our code is available at https://github.com/billsioros/EditGen

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经音高估计方法多基于原始音频波形或通用时频表示，缺乏任务特定特征。

Result: SWIPE前端可将网络规模缩小一个数量级而不降低性能，且SWIPE算法本身优于自监督神经音高估计器。

Conclusion: 任务特定特征（如SWIPE核）能显著提升神经音高估计的效率和性能。

Abstract: Neural networks have become the dominant technique for accurate pitch and
periodicity estimation. Although a lot of research has gone into improving
network architectures and training paradigms, most approaches operate directly
on the raw audio waveform or on general-purpose time-frequency representations.
We investigate the use of Sawtooth-Inspired Pitch Estimation (SWIPE) kernels as
an audio frontend and find that these hand-crafted, task-specific features can
make neural pitch estimators more accurate, robust to noise, and more
parameter-efficient. We evaluate supervised and self-supervised
state-of-the-art architectures on common datasets and show that the SWIPE audio
frontend allows for reducing the network size by an order of magnitude without
performance degradation. Additionally, we show that the SWIPE algorithm on its
own is much more accurate than commonly reported, outperforming
state-of-the-art self-supervised neural pitch estimators.

Abstract: Time-Frequency (TF) dual-path models are currently among the best performing
audio source separation network architectures, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in speech enhancement, music source separation, and cinematic audio
source separation. While they are characterized by a relatively low parameter
count, they still require a considerable number of operations, implying a
higher execution time. This problem is exacerbated by the trend towards bigger
models trained on large amounts of data to solve more general tasks, such as
the recently introduced task-aware unified source separation (TUSS) model.
TUSS, which aims to solve audio source separation tasks using a single,
conditional model, is built upon TF-Locoformer, a TF dual-path model combining
convolution and attention layers. The task definition comes in the form of a
sequence of prompts that specify the number and type of sources to be
extracted. In this paper, we analyze the design choices of TUSS with the goal
of optimizing its performance-complexity trade-off. We derive two more
efficient models, FasTUSS-8.3G and FasTUSS-11.7G that reduce the original
model's operations by 81\% and 73\% with minor performance drops of 1.2~dB and
0.4~dB averaged over all benchmarks, respectively. Additionally, we investigate
the impact of prompt conditioning to derive a causal TUSS model.

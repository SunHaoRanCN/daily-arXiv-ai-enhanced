Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD\nchannel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data\nsymbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next\ninstant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it\nallows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would\notherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols.\nSecond, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded\npilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot\nscheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower\ncomplexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eZak-OTFS\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5bfc\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Zak-OTFS\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u57df\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5bfc\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5206\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\u51cf\u5c11\u5bfc\u9891\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u9891\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DD\u57df\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u524d\u4e00\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5206\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\u5728Zak-OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bfc\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Experimental results show high performance,\nwith 94.5% accuracy, 93.2% precision, and 95.8% recall. Comparative analysis\nreveals that the hybrid model outperforms standalone CNN and LSTM\narchitectures, underscoring its combined strength. Notably, the model yields\nlow false-negative rates, which is essential for enabling timely intervention.\nThis research contributes a non invasive, automated solution for early termite\ndetection, with practical implications for improved pest monitoring, minimized\nstructural damage, and better decision making by homeowners and pest control\nprofessionals.

This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new\ndata which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training\nknowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be\ntime-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited\ncomputing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing\nresources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters.

In this paper, we propose design criteria to\ngenerate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that\nafter training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error\n(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network\nsolutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for\nreal-world implementations.

Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an\nattention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:\ntime-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to\ngenerate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase\nsignal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in\nthe best predictions compared to the state of the art.

Experiments with\nreal-world GPS data collected in dense urban areas demonstrate that the\nproposed method significantly improves the positioning success rate and the\nreceiver containment rate, even with imperfect LOS/NLOS classification.\nAlthough a slight increase in the position bound was observed due to the\nreduced number of satellites used, overall positioning reliability was\nsubstantially enhanced, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nin urban GNSS environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e00\u81f4\u6295\u7968\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u536b\u661f\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86ZSM\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02GNSS\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2dGNSS\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e38\u56e0\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u906e\u6321\u548c\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528RF\u3001GBDT\u548cSVM\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884cLOS/NLOS\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u536b\u661f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5305\u542b\u7387\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u536b\u661f\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8fb9\u754c\u7565\u6709\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57ce\u5e02GNSS\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Its attractiveness stems from\nleveraging existing lighting infrastructures equipped with light-emitting\ndiodes (LEDs), enabling cost-efficient deployments and achieving high-precision\npositioning accuracy in the centimeter-todecimeter range. However, widespread\nadoption of traditional VLP solutions faces significant barriers due to the\nincreased costs and operational complexity associated with modulating LEDs,\nwhich consequently reduces illumination efficiency by lowering their radiant\nflux. To address these limitations, recent research has introduced the concept\nof unmodulated Visible Light Positioning (uVLP), which exploits Light Signals\nof Opportunity (LSOOP) emitted by unmodulated illumination sources such as\nconventional LEDs. This paradigm offers a cost-effective, lowinfrastructure\nalternative for indoor positioning by eliminating the need for modulation\nhardware and maintaining lighting efficiency. This paper delineates the\nfundamental principles of uVLP, provides a comparative analysis of uVLP versus\nconventional VLP methods, and classifies existing uVLP techniques according to\nreceiver technologies into intensity-based methods (e.g., photodiodes, solar\ncells, etc.) and imaging-based methods.

A multiport model, which\nalso accounts for structural scattering, has been developed for non-periodic\nscatterers. However, many emerging systems operate at multiple frequencies or\ngenerate intermodulation harmonics, particularly when incorporating space-time\nmodulation (STM) or dynamic load control. These functionalities demand advanced\nmodeling approaches capable of capturing scattering behavior across several\nfrequencies and directions simultaneously. This article extends a multiport\nS-parameters-based model for predicting the scattering properties of\nmultifrequency operating structures. The model extends the applicability of\nconvenient S-matrix models to time-modulated multiport structures. Unlike known\napproaches, this model incorporates structural scattering, mutual coupling, the\npossibility of non-digital modulation, and non-periodic configurations,\nenabling precise analysis and optimization for a broad range of communication\nand sensing systems.

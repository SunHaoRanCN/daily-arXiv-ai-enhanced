### [1] [Joint Motion, Angle, and Range Estimation in Near-Field under Array Calibration Imperfections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13463)
*Ahmed Hussain,Asmaa Abdallah,Abdulkadir Celik,Ahmed M. Eltawil*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种低复杂度算法，通过二维离散傅里叶变换（2D-DFT）和MUSIC方法，高效估计近场（NF）目标的位置和速度参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在超大规模MIMO（UM-MIMO）系统中，近场通信中目标的位置和速度参数耦合，导致联合估计计算复杂度高。

Method: 将接收到的二维时空信号投影到角度-多普勒域，利用2D-DFT分析角度和多普勒扩展特性，结合MUSIC方法进行参数细化。

Result: 仿真结果显示，与最大似然估计相比，该方法在位置和速度估计上达到-40 dB的归一化均方误差（NMSE），同时显著降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法为近场目标运动参数提供了一种准确且高效的估计方案。

Abstract: Ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output MIMO (UM-MIMO) leverages large
antenna arrays at high frequencies, transitioning communication paradigm into
the radiative near-field (NF), where spherical wavefronts enable full-vector
estimation of both target location and velocity. However, location and motion
parameters become inherently coupled in this regime, making their joint
estimation computationally demanding. To overcome this, we propose a novel
approach that projects the received two-dimensional space-time signal onto the
angle-Doppler domain using a two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform
(2D-DFT). Our analysis reveals that the resulting angular spread is centered at
the target's true angle, with its width determined by the target's range.
Similarly, transverse motion induces a Doppler spread centered at the true
radial velocity, with the width of Doppler spread proportional to the
transverse velocity. Exploiting these spectral characteristics, we develop a
low-complexity algorithm that provides coarse estimates of angle, range, and
velocity, which are subsequently refined using one-dimensional multiple signal
classification (MUSIC) applied independently to each parameter. The proposed
method enables accurate and efficient estimation of NF target motion
parameters. Simulation results demonstrate a normalized mean squared error
(NMSE) of -40 dB for location and velocity estimates compared to maximum
likelihood estimation, while significantly reducing computational complexity.

*Gedeon Ghislain Nkwewo Ngoufo,Khaled Humadi,Elham Baladi,Gunes Karabulut Kurt*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在ISAC框架中使用SSK调制，结合正弦和啁啾雷达波形，验证了SSK在通信和感知中的有效性，并强调了波形选择对感知能力的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地球轨道（LEO）空间碎片的激增对轨道安全构成挑战，ISAC系统通过集成感知和通信功能提供解决方案。

Method: 研究采用SSK调制，结合正弦和啁啾雷达波形，评估其性能。

Result: 两种波形在SSK下具有相当的BER性能，但啁啾波形在距离估计和速度检测精度上表现更优。

Conclusion: SSK适用于ISAC系统，波形选择对优化感知能力至关重要，支持空间碎片监测的高效设计。

Abstract: The proliferation of space debris in low Earth orbit (LEO) presents critical
challenges for orbital safety, particularly for satellite constellations.
Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems provide a promising dual
function solution by enabling both environmental sensing and data
communication. This study explores the use of space shift keying (SSK)
modulation within ISAC frameworks, evaluating its performance when combined
with sinusoidal and chirp radar waveforms. SSK is particularly attractive due
to its low hardware complexity and robust communication performance. Our
results demonstrate that both waveforms achieve comparable bit error rate (BER)
performance under SSK, validating its effectiveness for ISAC applications.
However, waveform selection significantly affects sensing capability: while the
sinusoidal waveform supports simpler implementation, its high ambiguity limits
range detection. In contrast, the chirp waveform enables range estimation and
provides a modest improvement in velocity detection accuracy. These findings
highlight the strength of SSK as a modulation scheme for ISAC and emphasize the
importance of selecting appropriate waveforms to optimize sensing accuracy
without compromising communication performance. This insight supports the
design of efficient and scalable ISAC systems for space applications,
particularly in the context of orbital debris monitoring.

### [4] [Sensing and Stopping Interfering Secondary Users: Validation of an Efficient Spectrum Sharing System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13554)
*Meles Weldegebriel,Zihan Li,Dustin Maas,Greg Hellbourg,Ning Zhang,Neal Patwari*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: StopSec是一种隐私保护协议，能快速识别并停止次级用户（SU）对主用户（PU）的干扰，通过轻量级水印方法和实时实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决频谱共享中次级用户对主用户的干扰问题，确保快速自动停止干扰。

Method: 引入轻量级水印方法标记SU的OFDM数据包，通过数据库反馈机制实现干扰检测与停止。

Result: 实验显示干扰检测和停止延迟低于150毫秒，水印方法对SU数据链路无负面影响，且对时变信道鲁棒。

Conclusion: StopSec是一种高效的频谱共享协议，适用于需要快速自动停止干扰的场景。

Abstract: We present the design and validation of Stoppable Secondary Use (StopSec), a
privacy-preserving protocol with the capability to identify a secondary user
(SU) causing interference to a primary user (PU) and to act quickly to stop the
interference. All users are served by a database that provides a feedback
mechanism from a PU to an interfering SU. We introduce a new lightweight and
robust method to watermark an SU's OFDM packet. Through extensive over-the-air
real-time experiments, we evaluate StopSec in terms of interference detection,
identification, and stopping latency, as well as impact on SUs. We show that
the watermarking method avoids negative impact to the secondary data link and
is robust to real-world time-varying channels. Interfering SUs can be stopped
in under 150 milliseconds, and when multiple users are simultaneously
interfering, they can all be stopped. Even when the interference is 10 dB lower
than the noise power, StopSec successfully stops interfering SUs within a few
seconds of their appearance in the channel. StopSec can be an effective
spectrum sharing protocol for cases when interference to a PU must be quickly
and automatically stopped.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal enabler for
next-generation wireless communication systems. However, conventional AI-based
models encounter several limitations, such as heavy reliance on labeled data,
limited generalization capability, and task-specific design. To address these
challenges, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of channel
foundation models (CFMs)-a novel and unified framework designed to tackle a
wide range of channel-related tasks through a pretrained, universal channel
feature extractor. By leveraging advanced AI architectures and self-supervised
learning techniques, CFMs are capable of effectively exploiting large-scale
unlabeled data without the need for extensive manual annotation. We further
analyze the evolution of AI methodologies, from supervised learning and
multi-task learning to self-supervised learning, emphasizing the distinct
advantages of the latter in facilitating the development of CFMs. Additionally,
we provide a comprehensive review of existing studies on self-supervised
learning in this domain, categorizing them into generative, discriminative and
the combined paradigms. Given that the research on CFMs is still at an early
stage, we identify several promising future research directions, focusing on
model architecture innovation and the construction of high-quality, diverse
channel datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is poised to become one of the
defining capabilities of the sixth generation (6G) wireless communications
systems, enabling the network infrastructure to jointly support high-throughput
communications and situational awareness. While recent advances have explored
ISAC for both human-centric applications and environmental monitoring, existing
research remains fragmented across these domains. This paper provides the first
unified review of ISAC-enabled sensing for both human activities and
environment, focusing on signal-level mechanisms, sensing features, and
real-world feasibility. We begin by characterising how diverse physical
phenomena, ranging from human vital sign and motion to precipitation and flood
dynamics, impact wireless signal propagation, producing measurable signatures
in channel state information (CSI), Doppler profiles, and signal statistics. A
comprehensive analysis is then presented across two domains: human sensing
applications including localisation, activity recognition, and vital sign
monitoring; and environmental sensing for rainfall, soil moisture, and water
level. Experimental results from Long-Term Evolution (LTE) sensing under
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions are incorporated to highlight the
feasibility in infrastructure-limited scenarios. Open challenges in signal
fusion, domain adaptation, and generalisable sensing architectures are
discussed to facilitate future research toward scalable and autonomous ISAC.

### [8] [Simulation for Noncontact Radar-Based Physiological Sensing Using Depth-Camera-Derived Human 3D Model with Electromagnetic Scattering Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13826)

Abstract: This study proposes a method for simulating signals received by
frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar during respiratory monitoring, using
human body geometry and displacement data acquired via a depth camera. Unlike
previous studies that rely on simplified models of body geometry or
displacement, the proposed approach models high-frequency scattering centers
based on realistic depth-camera-measured body shapes and motions. Experiments
were conducted with six participants under varying conditions, including
varying target distances, seating orientations, and radar types, with
simultaneous acquisition from the radar and depth camera. Relative to
conventional model-based methods, the proposed technique achieved improvements
of 7.5%, 58.2%, and 3.2% in the correlation coefficients of radar images,
displacements, and spectrograms, respectively. This work contributes to the
generation of radar-based physiological datasets through simulation and
enhances our understanding of factors affecting the accuracy of non-contact

### [9] [On two fundamental properties of the zeros of spectrograms of noisy signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13829)
*Arnaud Poinas,Rémi Bardenet*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了信号加入高斯白噪声后，谱图零点的空间分布变化，发现零点能勾勒信号支持区域，并在干扰下形成确定性结构。通过简单信号模型，证明了零点密度和Rouché定理可解释这些现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨信号在噪声环境下谱图零点分布的变化规律，以及如何利用这些变化检测信号和支持区域。

Method: 通过简单信号模型，结合零点密度和Rouché定理，分析零点分布与信号支持区域的关系。

Result: 发现零点能勾勒信号支持区域，干扰下形成确定性结构，且参数（如信噪比）对分布有显著影响。

Conclusion: 零点分布可用于信号检测和支持区域分析，干扰下的确定性结构易于检测。

Abstract: The spatial distribution of the zeros of the spectrogram is significantly
altered when a signal is added to white Gaussian noise. The zeros tend to
delineate the support of the signal, and deterministic structures form in the
presence of interference, as if the zeros were trapped. While sophisticated
methods have been proposed to detect signals as holes in the pattern of
spectrogram zeros, few formal arguments have been made to support the
delineation and trapping effects. Through detailed computations for simple toy
signals, we show that two basic mathematical arguments, the intensity of zeros
and Rouch\'e's theorem, allow discussing delineation and trapping, and the
influence of parameters like the signal-to-noise ratio. In particular,
interfering chirps, even nearly superimposed, yield an easy-to-detect
deterministic structure among zeros.

### [10] [Device-Free Localization Using Commercial UWB Transceivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13938)
*Hyun Seok Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的粒子滤波方法，用于提高超宽带（UWB）设备自由定位的准确性，解决了低信噪比和复杂环境下的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业UWB收发器可以实现设备自由定位，但实际场景中由于低信噪比和环境干扰，定位精度难以保证。

Method: 通过分析信道脉冲响应（CIR）方差捕捉目标运动变化，使用基于注意力机制的一维U-Net提取目标反射分量并抑制噪声，最后结合粒子滤波估计目标位置。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在物联网和汽车应用中具有实用性，均方根误差约15厘米，平均处理时间4毫秒，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法是一种实用且经济高效的解决方案，适用于复杂环境下的高精度定位。

Abstract: Recently, commercial ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers have enabled not only
measuring device-to-device distance but also tracking the position of a
pedestrian who does not carry a UWB device. UWB-based device-free localization
that does not require dedicated radar equipment is compatible with existing
anchor infrastructure and can be reused to reduce hardware deployment costs.
However, it is difficult to estimate the target's position accurately in
real-world scenarios due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the
cluttered environment. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-assisted
particle filter to overcome these challenges. First, the channel impulse
response (CIR) variance is analyzed to capture the variability induced by the
target's movement. Then, a DL-based one-dimensional attention U-Net is used to
extract only the reflection components caused by the target and suppress the
noise components within the CIR variance profile. Finally, multiple
preprocessed CIR variance profiles are used as input to a particle filter to
estimate the target's position. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed system is a practical and cost-effective solution for IoT and
automotive applications with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 15 cm and
an average processing time of 4 ms. Furthermore, comparisons with existing
state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed method provides the best
performance with reasonable computational costs.

Result: 数值结果表明，所提算法相比传统波束成形方法能提升ISAC系统的整体性能。

Conclusion: 提出的失真感知混合波束成形设计有效优化了ISAC系统的通信和感知性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates a practical partially-connected hybrid beamforming
transmitter for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with distortion
from nonlinear power amplification. For this ISAC system, we formulate a
communication rate and sensing mutual information maximization problem driven
by our distortion-aware hybrid beamforming design. To address this non-convex
problem, we first solve for a fully digital beamforming matrix by alternatively
solving three sub-problems using manifold optimization (MO) and our derived
closed-form solutions. The analog and digital beamforming matrices are then
obtained through a decomposition algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm can improve overall ISAC performance compared to
traditional beamforming methods.

Conclusion: 硬件-软件协同设计方法在流体天线系统中有效优化了性能，同时保持了低延迟。

Abstract: This paper proposes a hardware-software co-design approach to efficiently
optimize beamforming and port selection in fluid antenna systems (FASs). To
begin with, a fluid-antenna (FA)-enabled downlink multi-cell multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) network is modeled, and a weighted sum-rate (WSR)
maximization problem is formulated. Second, a method that integrates graph
neural networks (GNNs) with random port selection (RPS) is proposed to jointly
optimize beamforming and port selection, while also assessing the benefits and
limitations of random selection. Third, an instruction-driven deep learning
accelerator based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is developed to
minimize inference latency. To further enhance efficiency, a scheduling
algorithm is introduced to reduce redundant computations and minimize the idle
time of computing cores. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
GNN-RPS approach achieves competitive communication performance. Furthermore,
experimental evaluations indicate that the FPGA-based accelerator maintains low
latency while simultaneously executing beamforming inference for multiple port
selections.

*Cheng-Hung Hu,Yusuke Yasud,Akifumi Yoshimoto,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一听众评分尺度的方法，通过比较分数捕捉语音质量评估和连续语音情感识别中的评分关系，提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的听众评分方法因个体差异存在偏差，均值评分方法可能因序数数据平均而失真。

Method: 建模统一听众评分尺度，利用比较分数捕捉评分关系。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在SQA和CSER任务中有效提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了其有效性和鲁棒性，优于传统均值评分方法。

Abstract: Speech Quality Assessment (SQA) and Continuous Speech Emotion Recognition
(CSER) are two key tasks in speech technology, both relying on listener
ratings. However, these ratings are inherently biased due to individual
listener factors. Previous approaches have introduced a mean listener scoring
scale and modeled all listener scoring scales in the training set. However, the
mean listener approach is prone to distortion from averaging ordinal data,
leading to potential biases. Moreover, learning multiple listener scoring
scales while inferring based only on the mean listener scale limits
effectiveness. In contrast, our method focuses on modeling a unified listener
scoring scale, using comparison scores to correctly capture the scoring
relationships between utterances. Experimental results show that our method
effectively improves prediction performance in both SQA and CSER tasks, proving
its effectiveness and robustness.

### [14] [TGIF: Talker Group-Informed Familiarization of Target Speaker Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14044)
*Tsun-An Hsieh,Minje Kim*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对特定说话人群体的目标说话人提取（TSE）方法，通过知识蒸馏技术优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TSE系统通常设计为通用模型，但实际应用中可能需要针对特定用户群体（如家庭）的定制化解决方案。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏方法，通过大型教师模型生成伪干净目标，训练特定群体的学生模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于通用基线模型，能更好地适应特定说话人群体的语音特征。

Conclusion: 提出的TGIF概念展示了为实际应用（如家庭设备上的TSE）开发专用解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art target speaker extraction (TSE) systems are typically
designed to generalize to any given mixing environment, necessitating a model
with a large enough capacity as a generalist. Personalized speech enhancement
could be a specialized solution that adapts to single-user scenarios, but it
overlooks the practical need for customization in cases where only a small
number of talkers are involved, e.g., TSE for a specific family. We address
this gap with the proposed concept, talker group-informed familiarization
(TGIF) of TSE, where the TSE system specializes in a particular group of users,
which is challenging due to the inherent absence of a clean speech target. To
this end, we employ a knowledge distillation approach, where a group-specific
student model learns from the pseudo-clean targets generated by a large teacher
model. This tailors the student model to effectively extract the target speaker
from the particular talker group while maintaining computational efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline
generic models by adapting to the unique speech characteristics of a given
speaker group. Our newly proposed TGIF concept underscores the potential of
developing specialized solutions for diverse and real-world applications, such
as on-device TSE on a family-owned device.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练音乐基础模型在MSA任务中因高时间分辨率和短音频窗口的限制，导致长音频分析效率低下且存在偏差。

Method: 采用音频窗口扩展和低分辨率适应策略，优化预训练模型以适应长音频分析。

Result: 在Harmonix Set和RWC-Pop数据集上，边界检测和结构功能预测性能显著提升，同时保持内存使用和推理速度。

Conclusion: 该方法为长音频音乐结构分析提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-based music structure analysis (MSA) is an essential task in Music
Information Retrieval that remains challenging due to the complexity and
variability of musical form. Recent advances highlight the potential of
fine-tuning pre-trained music foundation models for MSA tasks. However, these
models are typically trained with high temporal feature resolution and short
audio windows, which limits their efficiency and introduces bias when applied
to long-form audio. This paper presents a temporal adaptation approach for
fine-tuning music foundation models tailored to MSA. Our method enables
efficient analysis of full-length songs in a single forward pass by
incorporating two key strategies: (1) audio window extension and (2)
low-resolution adaptation. Experiments on the Harmonix Set and RWC-Pop datasets
show that our method significantly improves both boundary detection and
structural function prediction, while maintaining comparable memory usage and
inference speed.

Conclusion: NeuralPMWF成功结合了神经网络的灵活性和PMWF的明确控制机制，实现了高效语音增强。

Abstract: Noise suppression and speech distortion are two important aspects to be
balanced when designing multi-channel Speech Enhancement (SE) algorithms.
Although neural network models have achieved state-of-the-art noise
suppression, their non-linear operations often introduce high speech
distortion. Conversely, classical signal processing algorithms such as the
Parameterized Multi-channel Wiener Filter ( PMWF) beamformer offer explicit
mechanisms for controlling the suppression/distortion trade-off. In this work,
we present NeuralPMWF, a system where the PMWF is entirely controlled using a
low-latency, low-compute neural network, resulting in a low-complexity system
offering high noise reduction and low speech distortion. Experimental results
show that our proposed approach results in significantly better perceptual and
objective speech enhancement in comparison to several competitive baselines
using similar computational resources.

Abstract: Masked token prediction has emerged as a powerful pre-training objective
across language, vision, and speech, offering the potential to unify these
diverse modalities through a single pre-training task. However, its application
for general audio understanding remains underexplored, with BEATs being the
only notable example. BEATs has seen limited modifications due to the absence
of open-source pre-training code. Furthermore, BEATs was trained only on
AudioSet, restricting its broader downstream applicability. To address these
gaps, we present OpenBEATs, an open-source framework that extends BEATs via
multi-domain audio pre-training. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across
six types of tasks, twenty five datasets, and three audio domains, including
audio reasoning tasks such as audio question answering, entailment, and
captioning. OpenBEATs achieves state-of-the-art performance on six bioacoustics
datasets, two environmental sound datasets and five reasoning datasets,
performing better than models exceeding a billion parameters at one-fourth
their parameter size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multi-domain datasets and masked token prediction task to learn general-purpose
audio representations. To promote further research and reproducibility, we
release all pre-training and evaluation code, pretrained and fine-tuned
checkpoints, and training logs at https://shikhar-s.github.io/OpenBEATs

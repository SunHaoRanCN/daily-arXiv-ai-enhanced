This paper investigates the problem of\nlocalizing a low-cost Photo Detector (PD) in a VLC-based indoor environment\nconsisting of only a single Light Emitting Diode (LED) as an active anchor, and\nmultiple spatially distributed single-element OIRSs. We formulate the problem\nwithin an indirect, computationally efficient localization framework: first,\nthe optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators of the LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight\n(NLoS) distances are derived, using a suitable OIRS activation strategy to\nprevent interferences. To overcome the grid-based optimization required by the\nML NLoS estimator, we devise a novel algorithm based on an unstructured noise\nvariance transformation, which admits a closed-form solution. The set of\nestimated LoS/NLoS distances are then used within a low-complexity localization\nalgorithm combining an Iterative Weighted Least Squares (IWLS) procedure, whose\nweights are set according to the inverse of the Cram\\'er-Rao Lower Bound\n(CRLB), with an adaptive beam steering strategy that allows the OIRSs network\nto dynamically align with the PD, without any prior knowledge of its position.\nAccordingly, we derive the CRLB for both LoS/NLoS distance estimation and PD\nposition estimation.

The SM method combines the\ncomputational efficiency of EM single-physics simulations with the precision of\nmultiphysics simulations. The shared coarse model is based on EM single-physics\nresponses corresponding to various nontunable design parameters values.\nConversely, the fine model is implemented to delineate the behavior of\nmultiphysics responses concerning both nontunable and tunable design parameter\nvalues. The proposed overall surrogate model comprises multiple subsurrogate\nmodels, each consisting of one shared coarse model and two distinct mapping\nneural networks. The responses from the shared coarse model in the EM\nsingle-physics filed offer a suitable approximation for the fine responses in\nthe multiphysics filed, whereas the mapping neural networks facilitate\ntransition from the EM single-physics field to the multiphysics field. Each\nsubsurrogate model maintains consistent nontunable design parameter values but\npossesses unique tunable design parameter values. By developing multiple\nsubsurrogate models, optimization can be simultaneously performed for each\ntuning state. Nontunable design parameter values are constrained by all tuning\nstates, whereas tunable design parameter values are confined to their\nrespective tuning states. This optimization technique simultaneously accounts\nfor all the tuning states to fulfill the necessary multiple tuning state\nrequirements.

This paper establishes bounds\non the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is\nmeasured in terms of the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and\ncommunications performance is measured in terms of the\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratios.

While machine learning has achieved expert-level\nperformance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable\nmultimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of\npublicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals,\ndiagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide\nonly single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to\nbuild models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in\nreal-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext\nECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw\nwaveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual\ninterpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes\nbeat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering\nstructured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model\ninterpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the\nraw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature\nparameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved\nusing consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports\ntransformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable\nreasoning about cardiac health. By bridging the gap between traditional signal\nanalysis, image-based interpretation, and language-driven understanding, MEETI\nestablished a robust foundation for the next generation of explainable,\nmultimodal cardiovascular AI. It offers the research community a comprehensive\nbenchmark for developing and evaluating ECG-based AI systems."}

FL allows wireless devices (WDs) to\ncooperatively learn by sharing only local model parameters, without needing to\nshare the entire dataset. However, the emergence of large AI models has made\nexisting FL approaches inefficient, due to the significant communication\noverhead required. In this paper, we propose a novel over-the-air federated\ndistillation (FD) framework by synergizing the strength of FL and knowledge\ndistillation to avoid the heavy local model transmission. Instead of sharing\nthe model parameters, only the WDs' model outputs, referred to as knowledge,\nare shared and aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the superposition property\nof the multiple-access channel. We shall study the transceiver design in\nover-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting\nthe power constraints of the transceivers. The main challenge lies in the\nintractability of the learning performance analysis, as well as the non-convex\nnature and the optimization spanning the whole FD training period. To tackle\nthis problem, we first derive an analytical expression of the convergence rate\nin over-the-air FD. Then, the closed-form optimal solutions of the WDs'\ntransmit power and the estimator for over-the-air aggregation are obtained\ngiven the receiver combining strategy. Accordingly, we put forth an efficient\napproach to find the optimal receiver beamforming vector via semidefinite\nrelaxation. We further prove that there is no optimality gap between the\noriginal and relaxed problem for the receiver beamforming design. Numerical\nresults will show that the proposed over-the-air FD approach achieves a\nsignificant reduction in communication overhead, with only a minor compromise\nin testing accuracy compared to conventional FL benchmarks."}

However, the image quality in MSK ultrasound is\noften limited by speckle noise, low resolution, poor contrast, and anisotropic\nreflections, making bone images difficult to interpret without additional\npost-processing. Typically, medical ultrasound systems use delay and sum\nbeamforming (DASB) for image reconstruction, which is not specifically\noptimized for bone structures. To address these limitations, we propose\nBEAM-Net, a novel end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) that performs\nhigh-frame-rate ultrasound beamforming with integrated bone enhancement, using\nsingle-plane-wave (SPW) radio frequency (RF) data as input. Our approach embeds\na Bone Probability Map (BPM), which acts as an attention mechanism to enforce\nhigher structural similarity around bony regions in the image. The proposed\napproach is the first of its kind to incorporate bone enhancement directly into\nultrasound beamforming using deep learning.

In\nthis paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for an MA\narray-enhanced downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where a\nbase station deploys multiple MAs to serve multiple single-antenna users. Our\ngoal is to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the\ntransmit beamforming, positions of MAs, successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) decoding order, and users' corresponding decoding indicator matrix, while\nadhering to constraints on the maximum transmit power and finite MA moving\nregion.

One of the great strengths\nof wireless networks based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)\nis the ease with which different non-overlapping time-frequency (TF) resources\ncan be allocated to different users by simply shifting each user's signal in\ntime and frequency. However, a significant weaknesses of OFDM is the\ninflexibility of sub-carrier spacing. Since OFDM does not allow users to have\ndifferent sub-carrier spacing, a single user subject to inter-carrier\ninterference causes carrier spacing to increase for all users. Zak-OTFS is an\nalternative delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme, where, in contrast to\nOFDM, the Input-Output (I/O) relation is predictable. We match the strength of\nOFDM by designing a novel DD domain method of shaping the transmitted Zak-OTFS\npulse on the uplink that enables flexible non-overlapping TF resource\nallocation. The base station (BS) receives a superposition of uplink signals\nand applies individual matched filters to obtain the data specific to\nindividual users.

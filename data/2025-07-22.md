TL;DR: 研究改进了Cardiopulmonary Spot Jog Test (CPSJT)协议，通过性别、BMI等特征提升VO2max预测精度，机器学习模型表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VO2max测量方法（如CPET）昂贵且需专业人员，限制了大规模筛查。早期替代方法（如CPSJT）误差高，需改进。

Method: 改进CPSJT协议，引入性别、BMI等特征，使用多种机器学习模型（线性回归、随机森林、SVR）评估性能。

Result: 在44名印度参与者中，模型RMSE值较低（5.78-5.15），测试相关性高，表现稳健。

Conclusion: 改进的CPSJT协议结合机器学习，为VO2max预测提供了低成本、高精度的替代方案。

Abstract: VO2max is a critical indicator of cardiopulmonary fitness, reflecting the
maximum amount of oxygen the body can utilize during intense exercise.
Accurately measuring VO2max is essential for assessing cardiovascular health
and predicting outcomes in clinical settings. However, current methods for
VO2max estimation, such as Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET), require
expensive equipment and the supervision of trained personnel, limiting
accessibility for large-scale screening. Preliminary efforts have been made to
create a more accessible method, such as the Cardiopulmonary Spot Jog Test
(CPSJT). Unfortunately, these early attempts yielded high error margins,
rendering them unsuitable for widespread use. In our study, we address these
shortcomings by refining the CPSJT protocol to improve prediction accuracy. A
crucial contribution is improved feature extraction which include gender, body
mass index, aerobic duration, and anaerobic duration. This targeted approach
helps in streamlining the model to enhance prediction precision while
minimizing the risk of overfitting. In a cohort of 44 participants from the
Indian population, we assessed the performance of various machine learning
models using these features. With Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation, the Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values were 5.78 for Linear Regression, 5.15 for
Random Forest, and 5.17 for Support Vector Regression. All models demonstrated
strong test correlations and low RMSE values, underscoring their robust and
reliable performance.

TL;DR: DIVER-0是一个新型EEG基础模型，通过全时空注意力和改进的位置编码技术，解决了现有模型在时空动态建模和通道置换等变性方面的不足，实现了跨数据集泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型在时空动态建模和通道置换等变性方面存在局限，影响了其在不同电极配置下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出DIVER-0模型，采用全时空注意力机制，结合RoPE和二进制注意力偏置，并引入STCPE以保持时空平移和通道置换等变性。

Result: 实验显示DIVER-0仅用10%的预训练数据即达到竞争性性能，并在不同通道置换条件下表现一致。

Conclusion: DIVER-0验证了处理神经记录异质性的关键设计原则，为跨数据集泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique widely used in
brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications, yet existing EEG
foundation models face limitations in modeling spatio-temporal brain dynamics
and lack channel permutation equivariance, preventing robust generalization
across diverse electrode configurations. To address these challenges, we
propose DIVER-0, a novel EEG foundation model that demonstrates how full
spatio-temporal attention-rather than segregated spatial or temporal
processing-achieves superior performance when properly designed with Rotary
Position Embedding (RoPE) for temporal relationships and binary attention
biases for channel differentiation. We also introduce Sliding Temporal
Conditional Positional Encoding (STCPE), which improves upon existing
conditional positional encoding approaches by maintaining both temporal
translation equivariance and channel permutation equivariance, enabling robust
adaptation to arbitrary electrode configurations unseen during pretraining.
Experimental results demonstrate that DIVER-0 achieves competitive performance
with only 10% of pretraining data while maintaining consistent results across
all channel permutation conditions, validating its effectiveness for
cross-dataset generalization and establishing key design principles for
handling the inherent heterogeneity of neural recording setups.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating driving stress is vital for preventing accidents
and advancing both road safety and driver well-being. While vehicles are
equipped with increasingly sophisticated safety systems, many limits exist in
their ability to account for variable driving behaviors and environmental
contexts. In this study we examine how short-term stressor events impact
drivers' physiology and their behavioral responses behind the wheel. Leveraging
a controlled driving simulation setup, we collected physiological signals from
31 adult participants and designed a multimodal machine learning system to
estimate the presence of stressors. Our analysis explores the model sensitivity
and temporal dynamics against both known and novel emotional inducers, and
examines the relationship between predicted stress and observable patterns of
vehicle control. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of linking
physiological signals with contextual and behavioral cues in order to improve
real-time estimation of driving stress.

### [5] [Graph Convolutional Neural Networks to Model the Brain for Insomnia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14147)
*Kevin Monteiro,Sam Nallaperuma-Herzberg,Martina Mason,Steve Niederer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于脑电图（EEG）和图卷积神经网络（GCNN）的方法，用于识别失眠患者的脑功能特征，并实现了70%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有失眠治疗方法存在副作用，且缺乏针对失眠的脑模型研究。

Method: 使用连续长时程EEG数据，基于功能连接性和空间距离构建脑网络，计算主要脑波频段的功率谱密度，并训练GCNN模型进行分类。

Result: 50秒非重叠滑动窗口最适合EEG分段，分类准确率为70%（窗口级）和68%（被试级）。某些电极（如C4-P4、F4-C4、C4-A1）的缺失对模型性能影响较大。

Conclusion: 该方法为失眠的脑功能特征识别提供了新思路，并揭示了特定脑区在失眠中的重要性。

Abstract: Insomnia affects a vast population of the world and can have a wide range of
causes. Existing treatments for insomnia have been linked with many side
effects like headaches, dizziness, etc. As such, there is a clear need for
improved insomnia treatment. Brain modelling has helped with assessing the
effects of brain pathology on brain network dynamics and with supporting
clinical decisions in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, etc.
However, such models have not been developed for insomnia. Therefore, this
project attempts to understand the characteristics of the brain of individuals
experiencing insomnia using continuous long-duration EEG data. Brain networks
are derived based on functional connectivity and spatial distance between EEG
channels. The power spectral density of the channels is then computed for the
major brain wave frequency bands. A graph convolutional neural network (GCNN)
model is then trained to capture the functional characteristics associated with
insomnia and configured for the classification task to judge performance.
Results indicated a 50-second non-overlapping sliding window was the most
suitable choice for EEG segmentation. This approach achieved a classification
accuracy of 70% at window level and 68% at subject level. Additionally, the
omission of EEG channels C4-P4, F4-C4 and C4-A1 caused higher degradation in
model performance than the removal of other channels. These channel electrodes
are positioned near brain regions known to exhibit atypical levels of
functional connectivity in individuals with insomnia, which can explain such
results.

Result: 仿真显示定位精度高，对OIRS错位鲁棒，且迭代次数少。

Abstract: The integration of Optical Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (OIRSs) into
Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems is gaining momentum as a valid
alternative to RF technologies, harnessing the existing lighting
infrastructures and the vast unlicensed optical spectrum to enable higher
spectral efficiency, improved resilience to Line-of-Sight (LoS) blockages, and
enhanced positioning capabilities. This paper investigates the problem of
localizing a low-cost Photo Detector (PD) in a VLC-based indoor environment
consisting of only a single Light Emitting Diode (LED) as an active anchor, and
multiple spatially distributed single-element OIRSs. We formulate the problem
within an indirect, computationally efficient localization framework: first,
the optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators of the LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight
(NLoS) distances are derived, using a suitable OIRS activation strategy to
prevent interferences. To overcome the grid-based optimization required by the
ML NLoS estimator, we devise a novel algorithm based on an unstructured noise
variance transformation, which admits a closed-form solution. The set of
estimated LoS/NLoS distances are then used within a low-complexity localization
algorithm combining an Iterative Weighted Least Squares (IWLS) procedure, whose
weights are set according to the inverse of the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound
(CRLB), with an adaptive beam steering strategy that allows the OIRSs network
to dynamically align with the PD, without any prior knowledge of its position.
Accordingly, we derive the CRLB for both LoS/NLoS distance estimation and PD
position estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in terms of localization accuracy, robustness against OIRSs
misalignment conditions, and low number of iterations required to attain the
theoretical bounds.

Result: 在五种减少通道配置下，Self-DANA显著提升资源效率，减少CPU和GPU内存及时间消耗。

Conclusion: Self-DANA在资源效率和性能上均达到先进水平，适用于减少通道的ECG分析。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale machine learning models trained on
extensive, diverse datasets that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream
tasks with minimal fine-tuning. In the last two years, interest in FMs has also
grown for applications in the cardiological field to analyze the
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. One of the key properties of FMs is their
transferability to a wide range of downstream scenarios. With the spread of
wearable and portable devices, keen interest in learning from reduced-channel
configurations has arisen. However, the adaptation of ECG FMs to downstream
scenarios with fewer available channels still has to be properly investigated.
In this work, we propose Self-DANA, a novel, easy-to-integrate solution that
makes self-supervised architectures adaptable to a reduced number of input
channels, ensuring resource efficiency and high performance. We also introduce
Random Lead Selection, a novel augmentation technique to pre-train models in a
more robust and channel-agnostic way. Our experimental results on five
reduced-channel configurations demonstrate that Self-DANA significantly
enhances resource efficiency while reaching state-of-the-art performance. It
requires up to 69.3% less peak CPU memory, 34.4% less peak GPU memory, about
17% less average epoch CPU time, and about 24% less average epoch GPU time.

### [8] [Machine learning-enabled river water quality monitoring using lithography-free 3D-printed sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14152)
*Frank Efe Erukainure,Feidra Gjata,Matin Ataei Kachouei,Henry Cox,Md. Azahar Ali*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 开发了一种无光刻技术的磷酸盐传感器（P-sensor），用于检测河流中极低浓度的磷酸盐，以预防富营养化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 清洁水对全球粮食危机中的食物需求至关重要，磷酸盐等污染物会导致富营养化，引发健康和生态问题。

Method: 使用3D打印的周期性聚合物图案（8微米特征尺寸）涂覆磷酸盐选择性膜，形成固态指示电极。

Result: 传感器可检测低至1 ppb的磷酸盐，响应时间小于30秒，并通过神经网络预测磷酸盐水平，误差极低。

Conclusion: 该传感器为连续水质监测提供了实用工具，有助于改善公共健康。

Abstract: River water quality monitoring is important for aquatic life, livestock, and
humans because clean water is critical to meeting food demand during the global
food crisis. Excessive contaminants, including phosphate, deplete dissolved
oxygen and trigger eutrophication, leading to serious health and ecological
problems. Continuous sensors that track phosphate levels can therefore help
prevent eutrophication. In this work we present a lithography-free phosphate
sensor (P-sensor) that detects phosphate in river water at parts-per-billion
levels. The device uses a solid-state indicator electrode formed by 3D-printed
periodic polymer patterns (8 um feature size) coated with a thin phosphate
ion-selective membrane. The P-sensor detects as little as 1 ppb phosphate
across 0 - 475 ppm with a response time under 30 seconds. We validated the
sensor on Rappahannock River water, Virginia (less than 0.8 ppm phosphate) at
sites upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant and benchmarked the
results against a commercial phosphate meter. A feed-forward neural network was
trained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3,
zero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for
river samples. These results demonstrate a practical tool for continuous
water-quality monitoring that can inform stakeholders and policymakers and
ultimately improve public health.

Conclusion: 尽管结果尚属初步，但该方法为未来更大规模研究奠定了基础，有望改善PD的临床管理。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses challenges in diagnosis and monitoring due to
its progressive nature and complex symptoms. This study introduces a novel
approach utilizing surface electromyography (sEMG) to objectively assess PD
severity, focusing on the biceps brachii muscle. Initial analysis of sEMG data
from five PD patients and five healthy controls revealed significant
neuromuscular differences. A traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) model
achieved up to 83% accuracy, while enhancements with a Graph Convolutional
Network-Support Vector Machine (GCN-SVM) model increased accuracy to 92%.
Despite the preliminary nature of these results, the study outlines a detailed
experimental methodology for future research with larger cohorts to validate
these findings and integrate the approach into clinical practice. The proposed
approach holds promise for advancing PD severity assessment and improving
patient care in Parkinson's disease management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超密集子网络中极端和罕见事件干扰预测的挑战，特别是在动态移动性、快速变化的信道统计和零星流量下。

Result: 在超可靠区域中，BLER目标在95%百分位以上持续达成，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效处理深度衰落、随机流量和TDD不对齐，对极端干扰事件具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Interference prediction that accounts for extreme and rare events remains a
key challenge for ultra-densely deployed sub-networks (SNs) requiring
hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC), particularly under dynamic
mobility, rapidly varying channel statistics, and sporadic traffic. This paper
proposes a novel calibrated interference tail prediction framework, a hybrid
statistical and machine learning (ML) approach that integrates an inverted
quantile patch transformer (iQPTransformer) within extreme value theory (EVT).
It captures interference dynamics and tail behavior while quantifying
uncertainty to provide statistical coverage guarantees. Its effectiveness is
demonstrated by leveraging the estimated interference tail distribution to
design predictive, risk-aware resource allocation. In resource-constrained SN
scenarios, we introduce the split-iQPTransformer, enabling collaborative
training by distributing neural network components between sensor-actuator (SA)
pairs and the SN controller, while maintaining minimal performance disparity
compared to the centralized iQPTransformer. The framework effectively handles
deep fading, random traffic, and time-division duplexing (TDD) misalignments
and is resilient to rare and extreme interference events. Extensive evaluations
are performed under two mobility models and two realistic SN traffic patterns,
using a spatially consistent 3GPP channel model across all scenarios.
Experimental results show consistent achievement of block error rate (BLER)
targets beyond the 95th percentile in the hyper-reliable regime, significantly
outperforming baseline approaches.

Conclusion: VAE能有效消除单次心跳中的多种噪声源，有望提升心脏电生理学的治疗效果。

Abstract: In the field of cardiac electrophysiology (EP), effectively reducing noise in
intra-cardiac signals is crucial for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of
arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. However, traditional noise reduction
techniques fall short in addressing the diverse noise patterns from various
sources, often non-linear and non-stationary, present in these signals. This
work introduces a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, aimed at improving the
quality of intra-ventricular monophasic action potential (MAP) signal
recordings. By constructing representations of clean signals from a dataset of
5706 time series from 42 patients diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy, our
approach demonstrates superior denoising performance when compared to
conventional filtering methods commonly employed in clinical settings. We
assess the effectiveness of our VAE model using various metrics, indicating its
superior capability to denoise signals across different noise types, including
time-varying non-linear noise frequently found in clinical settings. These
results reveal that VAEs can eliminate diverse sources of noise in single
beats, outperforming state-of-the-art denoising techniques and potentially
improving treatment efficacy in cardiac EP.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has
significantly advanced environmental monitoring (EM) by enabling cost-effective
and scalable sensing solutions. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) and
artificial intelligence (AI) are introducing powerful tools for the efficient
and accurate analysis of complex environmental data. However, current IoT
platforms for environmental sensing are typically limited to a narrow set of
sensors, preventing a comprehensive assessment of environmental conditions and
lacking sufficient computational capabilities to support the deployment of
advanced ML and AI algorithms on the edge. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a compact (17x38 mm2), multi-modal, MCU-based environmental IoT node
integrating 11 sensors, including CO2 concentration, volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), light intensity, UV radiation, pressure, temperature, humidity, visual
sensing via an RGB camera, and precise geolocation through a GNSS module. It
features GAP9, a parallel ultra-low-power system-on-chip, enabling real-time,
energy-efficient edge processing of advanced ML models directly on-device. We
implemented a YOLOv5-based occupancy detection pipeline (0.3 M parameters, 42
MOP per inference), demonstrating 42% energy savings over raw data streaming.
Additionally, we present a smart indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring setup that
combines occupancy detection with adaptive sample rates, achieving operational
times of up to 143 h on a single compact 600 mAh, 3.7 V battery. Our platform
lays the groundwork for innovative applications such as predictive indoor IAQ,
enabling efficient AI-driven on-edge forecasting for energy-efficient and

Abstract: Preclinical sleep research remains constrained by labor intensive, manual
vigilance state classification and inter rater variability, limiting throughput
and reproducibility. This study presents an automated framework developed by
Team Neural Prognosticators to classify electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings
of small rodents into three critical vigilance states paradoxical sleep (REM),

(delta to gamma), temporal dynamics via Maximum-Minimum Distance, and
cross-frequency coupling metrics. These features capture distinct
neurophysiological signatures such as high frequency desynchronization during
wakefulness, delta oscillations in SWS, and REM specific bursts. Validated
during the 2024 Big Data Health Science Case Competition (University of South
Carolina Big Data Health Science Center, 2024), our XGBoost model achieved
91.5% overall accuracy, 86.8% precision, 81.2% recall, and an F1 score of
83.5%, outperforming all baseline methods. Our approach represents a critical

accelerating discoveries in sleep science and the development of targeted
interventions for chronic sleep disorders. As a publicly available code (BDHSC)

Abstract: Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system
(GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of
accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these
interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating
their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of
Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to
signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors.
Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources
for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth,
and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision
encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for
each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates
in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed
spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization
accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices
recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and
demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型干扰预测方案，用于改进密集部署工业子网络中高可靠低延迟通信的链路自适应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集部署的工业子网络中，高可靠性和低延迟通信需求对链路自适应提出了更高要求，传统方法难以应对干扰的复杂性和反馈延迟。

Method: 采用基于向量离散时间状态空间模型（vDSSM）的干扰预测方法，结合低复杂度、鲁棒的稀疏Student-t过程回归（SPTPR）技术，通过改进的无迹卡尔曼滤波器递归优化预测结果。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法复杂度比非参数基线低10倍以上，同时保持BLER低于1e-6的目标，性能接近仅使用CQI报告的先进监督技术。

Conclusion: 所提方法在复杂性和性能之间取得了良好平衡，适用于高可靠低延迟通信场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel interference prediction scheme to improve link adaptation
(LA) in densely deployed industrial sub-networks (SNs) with high-reliability
and low-latency communication (HRLLC) requirements. The proposed method aims to
improve the LA framework by predicting and leveraging the heavy-tailed
interference probability density function (pdf). Interference is modeled as a
latent vector of available channel quality indicator (CQI), using a vector
discrete-time state-space model (vDSSM) at the SN controller, where the CQI is
subjected to compression, quantization, and delay-induced errors. To robustly
estimate interference power values under these impairments, we employ a
low-complexity, outlier-robust, sparse Student-t process regression (SPTPR)
method. This is integrated into a modified unscented Kalman filter, which
recursively refines predicted interference using CQI, enabling accurate
estimation and compensating protocol feedback delays, crucial for accurate LA.
Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves over 10x lower
complexity compared to a similar non-parametric baseline. It also maintains a
BLER below the 90th percentile target of 1e-6 while delivering performance
comparable to a state-of-the-art supervised technique using only CQI reports.

Abstract: Human computer interaction has become integral to modern life, driven by
advancements in machine learning technologies. Affective computing, in
particular, has focused on systems that recognize, interpret, and respond to
human emotions, often using wearable devices, which provide continuous data
streams of physiological signals. Among various physiological signals, the
photoplethysmogram (PPG) has gained prominence due to its ease of acquisition
from widely available devices. However, the generalization of PPG-based emotion
recognition models across individuals remains an unresolved challenge. This
paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture that combines Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to address this issue. The proposed model
integrates the strengths of these architectures to improve robustness and
generalization. Raw PPG signals are fed into the CNN for feature extraction.
These features are processed separately by LSTM and TCN. The outputs from these
components are concatenated to generate a final feature representation, which
serves as the input for classifying valence and arousal, the primary dimensions
of emotion. Experiments using the Photoplethysmogram Dataset for Emotional
Analysis (PPGE) demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model achieves better
model generalization than standalone CNN and LSTM architectures. Our results
show that the proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN
architecture, as well as a CNN-LSTM model, in emotion recognition tasks with
PPG signals. Using metrics such as Area Under the Curve (AUC) and F1 Score, we
highlight the model's effectiveness in handling subject variability.

Abstract: We present a novel and interpretable framework for electrocardiogram
(ECG)-based disease detection that combines hyperdimensional computing (HDC)

BinaryLinear hyperdimensional projection layer, optimized jointly with
cross-entropy and proxy-based metric loss. This hybrid framework preserves the
symbolic interpretability of HDC while enabling task-adaptive representation
learning. Experiments on Apnea-ECG and PTB-XL demonstrate that our model
significantly outperforms traditional HDC and classical ML baselines, achieving
73.09\% precision and an F1 score of 0.626 on Apnea-ECG, with comparable
robustness on PTB-XL. Our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution
for edge-compatible ECG classification, with strong potential for interpretable

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了阻抗网络模型在线构建的难题。

Abstract: The impedance network (IN) model is gaining popularity in the oscillation
analysis of wind farms. However, the construction of such an IN model requires
impedance curves of each wind turbine under their respective operating
conditions, making its online application difficult due to the transmission of
numerous high-density impedance curves. To address this issue, this paper
proposes an AI-based impedance encoding-decoding method to facilitate the
online construction of IN model. First, an impedance encoder is trained to
compress impedance curves by setting the number of neurons much smaller than
that of frequency points. Then, the compressed data of each turbine are
uploaded to the wind farm and an impedance decoder is trained to reconstruct
original impedance curves. At last, based on the nodal admittance matrix (NAM)
method, the IN model of the wind farm can be obtained. The proposed method is
validated via model training and real-time simulations, demonstrating that the
encoded impedance vectors enable fast transmission and accurate reconstruction
of the original impedance curves.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多样条件下表现稳定，为未来研究提供了清洁、去标识化的FCD数据集和参数支持。

Abstract: Effective modern transportation systems depend critically on accurate Signal
Phase and Timing (SPaT) estimation. However, acquiring ground-truth SPaT
information faces significant hurdles due to communication challenges with
transportation departments and signal installers. As a result, Floating Car
Data (FCD) has become the primary source for large-scale SPaT analyses. Current
FCD approaches often simplify the problem by assuming fixed schedules and basic
intersection designs for specific times and locations. These methods fail to
account for periodic signal changes, diverse intersection structures, and the
inherent limitations of real-world data, thus lacking a comprehensive framework
that is universally applicable. Addressing this limitation, we propose an
industrial-grade FCD analysis suite that manages the entire process, from
initial data preprocessing to final SPaT estimation. Our approach estimates
signal phases, identifies time-of-day (TOD) periods, and determines the
durations of red and green lights. The framework's notable stability and
robustness across diverse conditions, regardless of road geometry, is a key
feature. Furthermore, we provide a cleaned, de-identified FCD dataset and
supporting parameters to facilitate future research. Currently operational
within our navigation platform, the system analyses over 15 million FCD records
daily, supporting over two million traffic signals in mainland China, with more
than 75\% of estimations demonstrating less than five seconds of error.

Abstract: Radar technology presents untapped potential for continuous, contactless, and
passive heart rate monitoring via consumer electronics like mobile phones.
However the variety of available radar systems and lack of standardization
means that a large new paired dataset collection is required for each radar
system. This study demonstrates transfer learning between frequency-modulated
continuous wave (FMCW) and impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar systems,
both increasingly integrated into consumer devices. FMCW radar utilizes a
continuous chirp, while IR-UWB radar employs short pulses. Our mm-wave FMCW
radar operated at 60 GHz with a 5.5 GHz bandwidth (2.7 cm resolution, 3
receiving antennas [Rx]), and our IR-UWB radar at 8 GHz with a 500 MHz
bandwidth (30 cm resolution, 2 Rx). Using a novel 2D+1D ResNet architecture we
achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 bpm and a mean absolute percentage
error (MAPE) of 1.42% for heart rate monitoring with FMCW radar (N=119
participants, an average of 8 hours per participant). This model maintained
performance (under 5 MAE/10% MAPE) across various body positions and heart rate
ranges, with a 98.9% recall. We then fine-tuned a variant of this model,
trained on single-antenna and single-range bin FMCW data, using a small (N=376,
avg 6 minutes per participant) IR-UWB dataset. This transfer learning approach
yielded a model with MAE 4.1 bpm and MAPE 6.3% (97.5% recall), a 25% MAE
reduction over the IR-UWB baseline. This demonstration of transfer learning
between radar systems for heart rate monitoring has the potential to accelerate
its introduction into existing consumer devices.

Motivation: 随着计算需求的增长，传统有线互连在高速数据传输中效率降低，短距离无线通信（SRWC）虽灵活但面临多径散射导致的信道脉冲响应（CIR）拉伸和符号间干扰（ISI）问题。

Method: 通过RIS调整反射波的相位，使多径分量在接收端组合成脉冲状CIR，从而减少ISI并提高数据速率。

Result: 实验验证了RIS在典型计算机机箱中的有效性，为未来数据处理单元中无线链路的增强提供了可能。

Conclusion: RIS支持的SRWC有望提升当前和未来数据处理单元的无线通信性能。

Abstract: Processing the exponentially growing amount of data produced daily requires
efficient communication between different processing units in a computer.
Traditionally, wired interconnects have been used to maintain these data links
due to their energy efficiency and ability to support high data rates. However,
as computing demands continue to increase in size and speed, these wired
interconnects can become longer and less effective. One possible solution is to
enhance the wired interconnects with short-range wireless communication (SRWC),
which offers flexible resource allocation and the ability to broadcast data.
However, implementing SRWC inside a computer chassis presents challenges due to
multiple scattering. This scattering stretches the channel impulse response
(CIR), leading to inter-symbol interference (ISI) and limiting data rates. To
address this issue, we propose transforming the computer chassis into a smart
radio environment by utilizing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The
RIS elements adjust the phase of reflected waves so that the multipath
components combine at the receiver in a way that creates a pulse-like CIR. This
approach has been experimentally validated within a typical computer chassis.
The results of this study pave the way for integrating RIS-enabled SRWC to
enhance wireless links in both current and future data processing units.

Conclusion: 提出的RIS辅助THz-SWIPT系统在自对准和能量传输效率方面表现出色，为物联网设备的可持续无线解决方案提供了新思路。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Internet of Things(IoT) devices underscores the
need for sustainable wireless solutions capable of simultaneously transferring
both energy and information. Terahertz (THz) band-enabled simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems offer ultra-high data rates and
expansive bandwidth. However, THz waves are inherently susceptible to severe
path loss and beam misalignment due to their narrow-beam characteristics. In
this context, this paper proposes a reconfigurable intelligent
surface(RIS)-assisted transmitter architecture for the THz-SWIPT system, which
enables end-to-end self-alignment for steady-state transmission. The proposed
system incorporates phase conjugate circuits to achieve self-aligned
beamforming, facilitating the dynamic tracking of mobile IoT devices without
the need for beam training. Additionally, active amplification within the RIS
arrays compensates for cascaded channel attenuation through an iterative power
cycle, thereby enhancing the energy transmission efficiency. Theoretical models
and simulations indicate that the proposed system significantly mitigates
sidelobe interference, achieving a transmission efficiency of up to 73.26% over
a 2 meter distance with self-alignment.

Conclusion: 分布式机器学习框架在6G网络中具有实现低延迟、高精度定位的潜力。

Abstract: Low-latency localization is critical in cellular networks to support
real-time applications requiring precise positioning. In this paper, we propose
a distributed machine learning (ML) framework for fingerprint-based
localization tailored to cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems, an emerging architecture for 6G networks. The proposed
framework enables each access point (AP) to independently train a Gaussian
process regression model using local angle-of-arrival and received signal
strength fingerprints. These models provide probabilistic position estimates
for the user equipment (UE), which are then fused by the UE with minimal
computational overhead to derive a final location estimate. This decentralized
approach eliminates the need for fronthaul communication between the APs and
the central processing unit (CPU), thereby reducing latency. Additionally,
distributing computational tasks across the APs alleviates the processing
burden on the CPU compared to traditional centralized localization schemes.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed framework achieves
localization accuracy comparable to centralized methods, despite lacking the
benefits of centralized data aggregation. Moreover, it effectively reduces
uncertainty of the location estimates, as evidenced by the 95\% covariance
ellipse. The results highlight the potential of distributed ML for enabling
low-latency, high-accuracy localization in future 6G networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多物理场优化中计算成本高和精度不足的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法在多物理场优化中具有高效性和准确性。

Abstract: This article introduces an advanced space mapping (SM) technique that applies
a shared electromagnetic (EM)-based coarse model for multistate tuning-driven
multiphysics optimization of tunable filters. The SM method combines the
computational efficiency of EM single-physics simulations with the precision of
multiphysics simulations. The shared coarse model is based on EM single-physics
responses corresponding to various nontunable design parameters values.
Conversely, the fine model is implemented to delineate the behavior of
multiphysics responses concerning both nontunable and tunable design parameter
values. The proposed overall surrogate model comprises multiple subsurrogate
models, each consisting of one shared coarse model and two distinct mapping
neural networks. The responses from the shared coarse model in the EM
single-physics filed offer a suitable approximation for the fine responses in
the multiphysics filed, whereas the mapping neural networks facilitate
transition from the EM single-physics field to the multiphysics field. Each
subsurrogate model maintains consistent nontunable design parameter values but
possesses unique tunable design parameter values. By developing multiple
subsurrogate models, optimization can be simultaneously performed for each
tuning state. Nontunable design parameter values are constrained by all tuning
states, whereas tunable design parameter values are confined to their
respective tuning states. This optimization technique simultaneously accounts
for all the tuning states to fulfill the necessary multiple tuning state
requirements. Multiple EM and multiphysics training samples are generated
concurrently to develop the surrogate model. Compared with existing direct
multiphysics parameterized modeling techniques, our proposed method achieves
superior multiphysics modeling accuracy with fewer training samples and reduced
computational costs.

Motivation: 传统EEG研究早产儿脑活动已取得进展，但胎儿阶段的神经发育仍存在未知窗口。fMEG是唯一能记录宫内神经活动的技术，但数据质量和稀缺性限制了研究。

Method: 开发了一种基于双扩散桥的非配对扩散翻译方法，结合数值积分改进，以较低计算成本获得更高质量结果。模型训练使用了30例早产儿EEG和44例fMEG记录的非配对数据集。

Result: 该方法在时间域均方误差上比GANs提升近5%，完全解决了频域的模式崩溃问题，信号保真度接近完美。

Conclusion: 研究在EEG-fMEG非配对翻译问题上设定了新标准，为早期脑活动分析铺平道路，且方法可推广至其他非配对信号翻译应用。

Abstract: Background and objective: Brain activity in premature newborns has
traditionally been studied using electroencephalography (EEG), leading to
substantial advances in our understanding of early neural development. However,
since brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of
this process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording
neural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography
(fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and
scarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer
the well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve
understanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better
detection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an
unpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which
notably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative
results at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired
dataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature
newborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that
our method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error
in the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the
frequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We
set a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our
developed tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis.
Overall, we also believe that our method could be reused for other unpaired
signal translation applications.

Motivation: 解决传统LoRa网络传输速率低和大规模接入的局限性。

Method: 基于Zadoff-Chu序列设计MCR-IM系统，提出PD-SIC算法以减少并行信道数量。

Result: MCR-IM系统在Nakagami-m衰落信道下BER性能优越，频谱效率提升16%-21%。

Conclusion: MCR-IM系统适合大规模、高速率的LoRa网络应用。

Abstract: We propose a multiple chirp rate index modulation (MCR-IM) system based on
Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences that overcomes the problems of low transmission rate
and large-scale access in classical LoRa networks. We demonstrate the extremely
low cross-correlation of MCR-IM signals across different spread factors,
showing that the proposed MCR-IM system also inherits the characteristics of ZC
sequences modulation. Moreover, we derive an approximate closed-form expression
for the bit-error rate (BER) of the proposed MCR-IM system over Nakagami-m
fading channels. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the derived
closed-form expression and demonstrate that the MCR-IM system achieves higher
levels of spectral efficiency (SE) compared to existing systems. In this
context, assigning multiple chirp rates to each user results in a reduction in
the number of parallel channels. To mitigate this issue, we propose a peak
detection based successive interference cancellation (PD-SIC) algorithm to
accommodate more users. Compared to orthogonal scatter chirp spreading spectrum
system that names OrthoRa, the MCR-IM system with PD-SIC algorithm achieves
lower BER levels. For a similar number of collision signals, the throughput of
the MCR-IM system is enhanced by 16% to 21%. Owing to these advantages, the
proposed MCR-IM is well suited for large-scale, high-rate LoRa network
applications.

Result: 仿真表明，该方法在平均AoI上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的AoI中心框架有效平衡了感知与通信需求，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) capabilities are envisioned to play a pivotal role in
future wireless networks due to their enhanced flexibility and efficiency.
However, jointly optimizing UAV trajectory planning, multi-user communication,
and target sensing under stringent resource constraints and time-critical
conditions remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an Age
of Information (AoI)-centric UAV-ISAC system that simultaneously performs
target sensing and serves multiple ground users, emphasizing information
freshness as the core performance metric. We formulate a long-term average AoI
minimization problem that jointly optimizes the UAV's flight trajectory and
beamforming. To tackle the high-dimensional, non-convexity of this problem, we
develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm capable of
providing real-time decisions on UAV movement and beamforming for both radar
sensing and multi-user communication. Specifically, a Kalman filter is employed
for accurate target state prediction, regularized zero-forcing is utilized to
mitigate inter-user interference, and the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is
applied for training the DRL agent on continuous actions. The proposed
framework adaptively balances the trade-offs between sensing accuracy and
communication quality. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves lower average AoI compared to baseline
approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the size of seated crowds
with commodity WiFi signals, by leveraging natural body fidgeting behaviors as
a passive sensing cue. Departing from prior binary fidget representations, our
approach leverages the bandwidth of the received signal as a finer-grained and
robust indicator of crowd counts. More specifically, we propose a mathematical
model that relates the probability density function (PDF) of the signal
bandwidth to the crowd size, using a principled derivation based on the PDF of
an individual's fidget-induced bandwidth. To characterize the individual
fidgeting PDF, we use publicly available online videos, each of a seated
individual, from which we extract body motion profiles using vision techniques,
followed by a speed-to-bandwidth conversion inspired by Carson's Rule from
analog FM radio design. Finally, to enhance robustness in real-world
deployments where unrelated motions may occur nearby, we further introduce an
anomaly detection module that filters out non-fidget movements. We validate our
system through 42 experiments across two indoor environments with crowd sizes
up to and including 13 people, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.04 and a
normalized mean square error of 0.15, with an average convergence time of 51
seconds, significantly reducing the convergence time as compared to the state
of the art. Additional simulation results demonstrate scalability to larger
crowd sizes. Overall, our results show that our pipeline enables fast, robust,
and highly accurate counting of seated crowds.

Conclusion: 该方案为6G网络中的ISAC系统提供了一种高效、节能的解决方案，特别适用于偏远地区的无线覆盖。

Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative approach by leveraging uncrewed aerial
vehicles (UAVs) as base stations (BSs) and a high-altitude platform station
(HAPS) as the central processing unit (CPU) in an integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system for 6G networks. We explore the challenges,
applications, and advantages of ISAC systems in next-generation networks,
highlighting the significance of optimizing position and power control. Our
approach integrates HAPS and UAVs to enhance wireless coverage, particularly in
remote areas. UAVs function as dual-purpose access points (APs), using their
maneuverability and line-of-sight (LoS) aerial-to-ground (A2G) links to
transmit combined communication and sensing signals. The scheme operates in two
time slots: in the first slot, UAVs transmit dedicated signals to communication
users (CUs) and potential targets. UAVs detect targets in specific ground
locations and, after signal transmission, receive reflected signals from
targets. In the second slot, UAVs relay these signals to HAPS, which performs
beamforming to align signals for each CU from various UAVs. UAVs decode
information from HAPS and adjust transmissions to maximize the beam pattern
efficiency toward the desired targets. We formulate a multi-objective
optimization problem to maximize both the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for CUs and the echo signal
power from the targets. This is achieved by finding the optimal power
allocation for CUs in each UAV, subject to constraints on the maximum total
power in each UAV and the transmitted beam pattern gain. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing network
performance, resource allocation, fairness, and system optimization. Using HAPS
as the CPU, computational tasks are offloaded from UAVs, which conserves energy
and improves network performance.

Conclusion: 半锥形换能器技术为6G网络提供了高度可重构和稳健的滤波器解决方案。

Abstract: Yttrium iron garnet magnetostatic wave (MSW) radio frequency (RF) cavity
filters are promising for sixth-generation (6G) communication systems due to
their wide frequency tunability. However, the presence of severe spurious modes
arising from the finite cavity dimensions severely degrades the filter
performance. We present a half-cone transducer that spatially tailors spin wave
excitation to selectively enhance the primary cavity modes comprising the MSW
filter passband, while strongly suppressing the undesired spurious modes.
Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experiments verify the
effectiveness of the spatially tailored technique. We utilize the half-cone
transducer to demonstrate a spurious-free, single-cavity half-cone MSW filter
(HC-MSWF) with an insertion loss (IL) of 2.4-3.2 dB over a frequency tuning
range of 6.3-16.8 GHz. Extending our study, we further demonstrate a
spurious-free, dual-cavity HC-MSWF with an unprecedented tuning range of 21.7
GHz (9.8-31.5 GHz) while maintaining a low IL of 2.9-3.8 dB. This significant
advance in performance will enable highly reconfigurable and robust 6G
networks.

Abstract: This work presents a high-resolution, ray-tracing-based channel modeling for
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite-to-ground links in a suburban environment at
X-band. Using simulations conducted in Wireless InSite, we develop a parametric
channel model that characterizes both large- and small-scale fading effects
across different satellite elevation angles. Large-scale fading incorporates
attenuation due to terrain-induced shadowing and dynamic environmental factors
such as weather conditions, and is compared with 3GPP NTN channel model.
Additionally, we quantify link degradation resulting from ground station (GS)
antenna misalignment, considering both fixed single-element and electronically
steerable phased-array antennas. Small-scale fading is modeled by fitting a
shadowed and non-shadowed Rician distribution to the fading statistics at
various satellite elevations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study to propose a comprehensive elevation-aware channel model for
satellite-to-ground propagation at X-band, integrating ray-traced environmental
dynamics, elevation-dependent fading, and phased-array beam misalignment
effects.

Conclusion: ME-STARS通过优化ME位置和波束成形，有效提升安全通信性能，但移动区域大小限制了保密率的进一步提升。

Abstract: A novel movable-element (ME) enabled simultaneously transmitting and
reflecting surface (ME-STARS)-aided secure communication system is
investigated. Against the full-space eavesdropping, MEs are deployed at the
STARS for enhancing the physical layer security by exploiting higher spatial
degrees of freedom. Specifically, a sum secrecy rate maximization problem is
formulated, which jointly optimizes the passive beamforming and the MEs
positions at the ME-STARS, as well as the active beamforming at the base
station. To solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem involving
highly-coupled variables, an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm
is developed, decomposing the original problem into three subproblems. In
particular, for the MEs position optimization subproblem, a gradient ascent
algorithm is employed to iteratively refine the MEs' locations within the
confined region. Moreover, the the active and passive beamforming subproblems
are solved by employing successive convex approximation. Numerical results
unveil that: 1) ME-STARS significantly improves the secrecy performance
compared to the conventional STARS with fixed-position elements; and 2) The
secrecy rate achieved by the ME-STARS gets saturated within limited movable
region size.

Abstract: A multiple-waveguide pinching-antenna (PA)-based multi-user communication
system is investigated. With a given number of PAs, two deployment strategies
are considered, namely the centralized PA deployment, where all PAs are
switched between waveguides to serve users in a time-division manner to avail
of beamforming gain, and the distributed PA deployment, where a single PA is
deployed on each waveguide to simultaneously serve multiple users by leveraging
the multiplexing gain. The spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by each deployment
strategy is analyzed: i) For the centralized deployment, the positioning
strategy of PAs on each waveguide is determined first with the aim of
maximizing the channel gain of the corresponding nearest served user. Based on
this, the corresponding system SE is derived. ii) For the distributed
deployment, the system SE under the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is first
obtained. To obtain an analytically tractable form, the stationary phase method
is utilized to approximate the system SE. The approximation result reveals that
the average inter-user interference can be negligible with a large waveguide
spacing and thus the simple MRT is appealing for PA-based multi-user
communications. Furthermore, the system SEs achieved by the two strategies are
compared in both the high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Our
analysis suggests that at high SNRs, the distributed deployment is superior to
achieve the maximal system SE, while the centralized deployment is more
suitable for the low-SNR regime. Finally, the theoretical analysis is verified
through simulations.

Abstract: Jamming cancellation is essential to reliable unmanned autonomous vehicle
(AAV) communications in the presence of malicious jammers. In this paper, we
develop a practical multichannel-aided jamming cancellation method to realize
secure AAV communications. The proposed method is capable of simultaneously
achieving timing/frequency synchronization as well as jamming cancellation.
More importantly, our method does not need the signal's/jammer's channel state
information. It only utilizes the knowledge of the legitimate sender's preamble
sequence that is available in existing communication protocols. We also analyze
the length of the preamble sequence required for successful synchronization and
signal recovery. Experimental results on the built hardware platform show that,
with a two-antenna receiver, the proposed method can successfully decode the
signal of interest even when the jamming signal is $40$dB stronger than the
communication signal.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have emerged as promising deep learning (DL) tools
for modeling complex sequence-to-sequence interactions in channel decoding.
However, current transformer-based decoders for error correction codes (ECCs)
demonstrate inferior performance and generalization capabilities compared to
conventional algebraic decoders, especially in short-code regimes. In this
work, we propose a novel latent-attention based transformer (LAT) decoder for
polar codes that addresses the limitations on performance and generalization
through three pivotal innovations. First, we develop a latent-attention
mechanism that supersedes the conventional self-attention mechanism. This
architectural modification enables independent learning of the Query and Key
matrices for code-aware attention computation, decoupling them from the Value
matrix to emphasize position-wise decoding interactions while reducing context
correlation interference. Second, we devise an advanced training framework
incorporating three synergistic components: entropy-aware importance sampling
that emphasizes low-probability regions in the signal constellation space,
experience reflow that introduces empirical labels to improve characterization
of decoding boundaries, and dynamic label smoothing for likelihood-based
regularization. Third, we propose a code-aware mask scheme which allows dynamic
adaptation for varying code configurations. Numerical evaluations demonstrate
that the proposed LAT decoder achieves near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance
in terms of both bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) for
short-length polar codes. Furthermore, the architecture exhibits robust
generalization capabilities across diverse code rates and code lengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在集成感知与通信系统中，如何通过优化波束形成器数量来同时提升感知和通信性能。

Method: 通过Cramér-Rao界衡量感知性能，信号干扰噪声比衡量通信性能，建立理论界限。

Result: 无干扰消除时，波束形成器数量界限为√(K² + L(L+1)/2)；有干扰消除时为K + √(L(L+1)/2)。

Conclusion: 波束形成器数量界限低于单独任务之和，且在某些情况下通信波束形成器已足够。

Abstract: Consider a downlink integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system in
which a base station employs linear beamforming to communicate to $K$ users,
while simultaneously uses sensing beams to perform a sensing task of estimating
$L$ real parameters. How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best
performance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds
on the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is
measured in terms of the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and
communications performance is measured in terms of the
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires
at most $K + \sqrt{\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the
ability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling
interference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes
$\sqrt{K^2 + \frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound
on the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task
individually. These results can be extended to sensing tasks for which the
performance is measured as a function of $d$ quadratic terms in the
beamformers. In this case, the bound becomes $K + \sqrt{d}$ and $\sqrt{K^2 +
d}$, respectively. Specifically, for estimating complex path losses and
angles-of-arrival of $N_\text{tr}$ targets while communicating to $K$ users,
the bound on the minimum number of beamformers scales linearly in $K$ and in
$N_\text{tr}$, assuming interference from sensing can be cancelled. When
interference cancellation is not possible, the following exact characterization
for the case of $N_\text{tr} = 1$ can be obtained: when $K=0$ or $1$, two
beamformers should be used; when $K \ge 2$, exactly $K$ beamformers should be
used, i.e., communication beamformers alone are already sufficient.

Motivation: FTN信号因其高谱效成为未来通信的潜在解决方案，但其快速加速特性导致脉冲高度重叠，恶化了PAPR性能。

Method: 分析了MIMO FTN系统中高斯符号在固定发射功率和固定接收信噪比两种功率约束下的PAPR行为。

Result: PAPR主要由加速因子和功率约束决定，功率分配优化对高斯信号的PAPR行为无显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了FTN系统中PAPR的关键影响因素，为未来通信系统的设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist signaling serves as a promising solution for improving
spectral efficiency in future generations of communications. However, its
nature of fast acceleration brings highly overlapped pulses that lead to worse
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance. In this paper, we investigate
the PAPR behavior of MIMO FTN using Gaussian symbols under optimal power
allocation for two power constraints: fixed transmit power and fixed received
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Our findings reveal that PAPR is mainly determined
by the acceleration factor and the power constraint, but power allocation
optimization does not change the PAPR behavior for Gaussian signaling.

using graph attention networks (GAT). To emphasize connectivity biomarkers, we
adapt the inherently node-focused GAT to analyze edges. We also designed signal
preprocessing for low-fidelity recordings and a lightweight GAT architecture
trained on Google Colab and deployed on RaspberryPi devices. Results: The
approach achieves promising classification performance, outperforming a
standard classifier based on random forest and graph convolutional networks in
terms of accuracy and robustness over multiple sessions, but also highlighting
specific connections in the fronto-temporal region. Conclusions: The results
highlight the potential of GATs to provide insightful and scalable diagnostic
support for epilepsy in underserved regions, paving the way for affordable and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ECG数据集多为单模态或双模态，限制了多模态AI系统的临床部署。MEETI填补了这一空白。

Method: MEETI同步了原始ECG波形、高分辨率图像、详细文本解释和提取的特征参数，通过统一标识符对齐。

Result: MEETI为多模态学习提供了统一结构，支持细粒度分析和可解释的心血管AI。

Conclusion: MEETI为下一代可解释的多模态心血管AI奠定了坚实基础，为研究社区提供了全面基准。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a foundational role in modern cardiovascular
care, enabling non-invasive diagnosis of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and
conduction disorders. While machine learning has achieved expert-level
performance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable
multimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of
publicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals,
diagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide
only single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to
build models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in
real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext
ECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw
waveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual
interpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes
beat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering
structured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model
interpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the
raw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature
parameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved
using consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports
transformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable
reasoning about cardiac health. By bridging the gap between traditional signal
analysis, image-based interpretation, and language-driven understanding, MEETI
established a robust foundation for the next generation of explainable,
multimodal cardiovascular AI. It offers the research community a comprehensive
benchmark for developing and evaluating ECG-based AI systems.

Motivation: 大型AI模型的出现使现有FL方法因通信开销过大而效率低下，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 空中联合蒸馏框架是一种高效的替代方案，适用于资源受限的无线设备协作学习。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation and growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to
the development of federated learning (FL). FL allows wireless devices (WDs) to
cooperatively learn by sharing only local model parameters, without needing to
share the entire dataset. However, the emergence of large AI models has made
existing FL approaches inefficient, due to the significant communication
overhead required. In this paper, we propose a novel over-the-air federated
distillation (FD) framework by synergizing the strength of FL and knowledge
distillation to avoid the heavy local model transmission. Instead of sharing
the model parameters, only the WDs' model outputs, referred to as knowledge,
are shared and aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the superposition property
of the multiple-access channel. We shall study the transceiver design in
over-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting
the power constraints of the transceivers. The main challenge lies in the
intractability of the learning performance analysis, as well as the non-convex
nature and the optimization spanning the whole FD training period. To tackle
this problem, we first derive an analytical expression of the convergence rate
in over-the-air FD. Then, the closed-form optimal solutions of the WDs'
transmit power and the estimator for over-the-air aggregation are obtained
given the receiver combining strategy. Accordingly, we put forth an efficient
approach to find the optimal receiver beamforming vector via semidefinite
relaxation. We further prove that there is no optimality gap between the
original and relaxed problem for the receiver beamforming design. Numerical
results will show that the proposed over-the-air FD approach achieves a
significant reduction in communication overhead, with only a minor compromise
in testing accuracy compared to conventional FL benchmarks.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于固定核卷积神经网络（CNN）的FTN信号检测器，通过结构化固定核层和领域知识掩码减少符号间干扰（ISI），在计算效率和检测准确性上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FTN信号检测方法如BCJR算法计算复杂度高，而标准CNN的滑动核无法有效捕捉ISI。本文旨在设计一种高效且准确的FTN检测器。

Method: 使用固定位置核直接捕捉不同距离的ISI效应，并采用分层滤波器分配策略，早期层分配更多滤波器以处理强ISI，后期层减少滤波器。

Result: 在τ≥0.7时，检测器达到接近最优的误码率（BER），计算效率比M-BCJR提升46%（BPSK）和84%（QPSK）。

Conclusion: 固定核CNN架构首次应用于FTN检测，显著提升了效率和性能，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detector for
faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling that employs structured fixed kernel layers
with domain-informed masking to mitigate intersymbol interference (ISI). Unlike
standard CNNs with sliding kernels, the proposed method utilizes fixed-position
kernels to directly capture ISI effects at varying distances from the central
symbol. A hierarchical filter allocation strategy is also introduced, assigning
more filters to earlier layers for strong ISI patterns and fewer to later
layers for weaker ones. This design improves detection accuracy while reducing
redundant operations. Simulation results show that the detector achieves
near-optimal bit error rate (BER) performance for $\tau \geq 0.7$, closely
matching the BCJR algorithm, and offers computational gains of up to $46\%$ and
$84\%$ over M-BCJR for BPSK and QPSK, respectively. Comparative analysis with
other methods further highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposed approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application
of a fixed-kernel CNN architecture tailored for FTN detection in the
literature.

Conclusion: BEAM-Net首次将骨骼增强直接融入超声波束形成，为骨骼超声成像提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pocket-sized, low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) devices are
increasingly used in musculoskeletal (MSK) applications for structural
examination of bone tissue. However, the image quality in MSK ultrasound is
often limited by speckle noise, low resolution, poor contrast, and anisotropic
reflections, making bone images difficult to interpret without additional
post-processing. Typically, medical ultrasound systems use delay and sum
beamforming (DASB) for image reconstruction, which is not specifically
optimized for bone structures. To address these limitations, we propose
BEAM-Net, a novel end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) that performs
high-frame-rate ultrasound beamforming with integrated bone enhancement, using
single-plane-wave (SPW) radio frequency (RF) data as input. Our approach embeds
a Bone Probability Map (BPM), which acts as an attention mechanism to enforce
higher structural similarity around bony regions in the image. The proposed
approach is the first of its kind to incorporate bone enhancement directly into
ultrasound beamforming using deep learning. BEAM-Net was trained and evaluated
on in-vivo MSK and synthetic RF ultrasound datasets. This paper introduces the
Edge Preservation Index (EPI) as a new region-focused metric for evaluating
structural fidelity in bone-enhanced ultrasound images. The performance of
BEAM-Net was compared with conventional DASB and existing deep learning
architectures using the EPI, Contrast Ratio (CR), Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR),
Speckle Similarity Index (SSI), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
BEAM-Net showed substantial gains over SPW-DASB, achieving 51.4-51% higher CR
and 94.2-73.3% higher SNR on in-vivo MSK and synthetic RF datasets. It
outperformed multiple steered plane wave DASB (MPW-DASB), with 19.8-24.0%
improvements in CR and SNR on in-vivo MSK and 2.5-12.8% improvements on
synthetic data.

Conclusion: 癫痫独立分割方法对EEG记录丰富的患者更适用，通道选择显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic, noncommunicable brain disorder, and sudden seizure
onsets can significantly impact patients' quality of life and health. However,
wearable seizure-predicting devices are still limited, partly due to the bulky
size of EEG-collecting devices. To relieve the problem, we proposed a novel
two-stage channel-aware Set Transformer Network that could perform seizure
prediction with fewer EEG channel sensors. We also tested a seizure-independent
division method which could prevent the adjacency of training and test data.
Experiments were performed on the CHB-MIT dataset which includes 22 patients
with 88 merged seizures. The mean sensitivity before channel selection was
76.4% with a false predicting rate (FPR) of 0.09/hour. After channel selection,
dominant channels emerged in 20 out of 22 patients; the average number of
channels was reduced to 2.8 from 18; and the mean sensitivity rose to 80.1%
with an FPR of 0.11/hour. Furthermore, experimental results on the
seizure-independent division supported our assertion that a more rigorous
seizure-independent division should be used for patients with abundant EEG
recordings.

Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the robust beamforming design for an

Taking into account quantization noise, we aim at maximizing the radar
signal-to-quantization-plus-noise ratio (SQNR) while guaranteeing the minimum
required signal-to-quantization-plus-interference-plus-noise ratio (SQINR) for
communication users. To address this nonconvex design problem, we first examine
a scenario involving a point target and uniform-resolution DACs, where the
globally optimal solution is obtained by applying the semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) technique. For more general scenarios, including those with mixed-DACs
and/or an extended target, we develop a low-complexity
majorization-minimization (MM)-based algorithm to tackle the problem
iteratively. Compared to the non-robust algorithm, the proposed algorithm
demonstrates improved detection performance under practical quantization.
Simulation results confirm the robustness and efficacy of our proposed
algorithm in low-resolution quantization scenarios.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) systems have recently attracted significant attention in
the field of wireless communications owing to their exceptional capability to
proactively reconfigure wireless channels via flexible antenna movements. In
this paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for an MA
array-enhanced downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where a
base station deploys multiple MAs to serve multiple single-antenna users. Our
goal is to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the
transmit beamforming, positions of MAs, successive interference cancellation
(SIC) decoding order, and users' corresponding decoding indicator matrix, while
adhering to constraints on the maximum transmit power and finite MA moving
region. The formulated problem is inherently highly non-convex, rendering it
challenging to acquire a globally optimal solution. As a compromise, we propose
a low-complexity two-stage optimization algorithm to obtain an effective
suboptimal solution. Specifically, in stage one, the SIC decoding order is
first determined by solving a channel gain maximization problem. Then, in stage
two, with the given SIC decoding order, the beamforming vectors, MA positions,
and users' decoding indicator matrix are iteratively optimized by capitalizing
on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation (SCA), and genetic
algorithm (GA). Simulation results unveil that the sum-rate performance of the
proposed MA-enabled downlink NOMA system significantly outperforms that of
conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. Moreover, the results also
show that the antenna position optimization in the proposed algorithm can
further enhance the advantages of NOMA over space division multiple access
(SDMA).

Conclusion: Zak-OTFS的可预测波形优势可在上行链路通信架构中实现，为下一代网络提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Wireless users with different characteristics will be expected to share
spectrum in next generation communication networks. One of the great strengths
of wireless networks based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
is the ease with which different non-overlapping time-frequency (TF) resources
can be allocated to different users by simply shifting each user's signal in
time and frequency. However, a significant weaknesses of OFDM is the
inflexibility of sub-carrier spacing. Since OFDM does not allow users to have
different sub-carrier spacing, a single user subject to inter-carrier
interference causes carrier spacing to increase for all users. Zak-OTFS is an
alternative delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme, where, in contrast to
OFDM, the Input-Output (I/O) relation is predictable. We match the strength of
OFDM by designing a novel DD domain method of shaping the transmitted Zak-OTFS
pulse on the uplink that enables flexible non-overlapping TF resource
allocation. The base station (BS) receives a superposition of uplink signals
and applies individual matched filters to obtain the data specific to
individual users. We develop theoretical measures of interference between
users, and present numerical simulations for a vehicular channel model
representative of next generation propagation environments. We demonstrate
single-user performance in a multiuser Zak-OTFS uplink system without needing
to provision guard bands between TF resources allocated to different users.
These performance results demonstrate that the benefits of a predictable
Zak-OTFS waveform can be realized within an architecture for uplink

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合近场感知、计算和语义通信的新框架（NF-ISCSC），利用流体天线（FAs）实现动态适应，优化数据速率和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近场感知与通信（NF-ISAC）虽提升性能，但面临数据量大和隐私风险问题，需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出NF-ISCSC框架，结合语义通信减少数据量，引入FAs适应信道变化，并通过交替优化方法解决联合优化问题。

Result: 仿真显示该框架提高了数据速率并增强了隐私保护。

Conclusion: NF-ISCSC框架有效解决了近场感知通信的挑战，为下一代技术提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for
next-generation technologies. With high-frequency bands and large-scale antenna
arrays, the Rayleigh distance extends, necessitating near-field (NF) models
where waves are spherical. Although NF-ISAC improves both sensing and
communication, it also poses challenges such as high data volume and potential
privacy risks. To address these, we propose a novel framework: near-field
integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (NF-ISCSC), which
leverages semantic communication to transmit contextual information only,
thereby reducing data overhead and improving efficiency. However, semantic
communication is sensitive to channel variations, requiring adaptive
mechanisms. To this end, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced to support the
NF-ISCSC system, enabling dynamic adaptability to changing channels. The
proposed FA-enabled NF-ISCSC framework considers multiple communication users
and extended targets comprising several scatterers. A joint optimization
problem is formulated to maximize data rate while accounting for sensing
quality, computational load, and power budget. Using an alternating
optimization (AO) approach, the original problem is divided into three
sub-problems: ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction ratio.
Beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation method. FA
positioning is solved via a projected Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)
algorithm, and the semantic extraction ratio is optimized using bisection
search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves
higher data rates and better privacy preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在捕捉口音和不流畅语音中的音素差异时效果不佳，需要更准确的音素错误检测方法。

Method: 使用多任务训练和音素相似性建模，转录说话者实际发音而非预期发音。

Result: 开发了VCTK-accent数据集，提出了两个新评估指标，建立了音素错误检测的新基准。

Conclusion: 该框架和数据集为音素错误检测提供了更有效的工具和评估标准。

Abstract: Phonetic error detection, a core subtask of automatic pronunciation
assessment, identifies pronunciation deviations at the phoneme level. Speech
variability from accents and dysfluencies challenges accurate phoneme
recognition, with current models failing to capture these discrepancies
effectively. We propose a verbatim phoneme recognition framework using
multi-task training with novel phoneme similarity modeling that transcribes
what speakers actually say rather than what they're supposed to say. We develop
and open-source \textit{VCTK-accent}, a simulated dataset containing phonetic
errors, and propose two novel metrics for assessing pronunciation differences.
Our work establishes a new benchmark for phonetic error detection.

Motivation: 由于监管和隐私问题，依赖云服务进行ASR推理在儿童语音应用中面临挑战，研究旨在设计隐私保护的本地化解决方案。

Method: 使用MyST语料库评估，通过过滤策略微调`tiny.en`模型，并采用低秩压缩技术减少模型大小和计算需求。

Result: 优化后的模型词错误率为15.9%（过滤后11.8%），压缩后模型在GPU上推理速度提升1.26倍，树莓派上计算需求减少。

Conclusion: 研究表明轻量级模型在树莓派上可行，但小模型可能带来额外开销和热节流问题。

Abstract: Reliability on cloud providers for ASR inference to support child-centered
voice-based applications is becoming challenging due to regulatory and privacy
challenges. Motivated by a privacy-preserving design, this study aims to
develop a lightweight & efficient Whisper ASR system capable of running on a
Raspberry Pi. Upon evaluation of the MyST corpus and by examining various
filtering strategies to fine-tune the `tiny.en' model, a Word Error Rate (WER)
of 15.9% was achieved (11.8% filtered). A low-rank compression reduces the
encoder size by 0.51M with 1.26x faster inference in GPU, with 11% relative WER
increase. During inference on Pi, the compressed version required ~2 GFLOPS
fewer computations. The RTF for both the models ranged between [0.23-0.41] for
various input audio durations. Analyzing the RAM usage and CPU temperature
showed that the PI was capable of handling both the tiny models, however it was
noticed that small models initiated additional overhead/thermal throttling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音转换模型在实时约束下难以保持语义保真、自然度和适应未见过的说话者特征，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: Conan包含三个核心组件：流式内容提取器（Emformer）、自适应风格编码器和因果混洗声码器（HiFiGAN）。

Result: 实验表明，Conan在主客观指标上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Conan通过创新的架构设计，实现了高效的在线零样本语音转换，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Zero-shot online voice conversion (VC) holds significant promise for
real-time communications and entertainment. However, current VC models struggle
to preserve semantic fidelity under real-time constraints, deliver
natural-sounding conversions, and adapt effectively to unseen speaker
characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce Conan, a chunkwise
online zero-shot voice conversion model that preserves the content of the
source while matching the voice timbre and styles of reference speech. Conan
comprises three core components: 1) a Stream Content Extractor that leverages
Emformer for low-latency streaming content encoding; 2) an Adaptive Style
Encoder that extracts fine-grained stylistic features from reference speech for
enhanced style adaptation; 3) a Causal Shuffle Vocoder that implements a fully
causal HiFiGAN using a pixel-shuffle mechanism. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that Conan outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective
metrics. Audio samples can be found at https://aaronz345.github.io/ConanDemo.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于参数高效微调（PEFT）的基础模型方法，用于唇腭裂（CLP）检测和严重程度分类，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 唇腭裂的严重程度与鼻音化相关，传统方法难以有效区分，而基础模型在领域数据微调后可能表现更好。

Method: 使用自监督模型（Wav2Vec2、WavLM）和弱监督模型（Whisper）提取特征，结合SVM分类器，并与传统手工特征（eGeMAPS、ComParE）对比，最终采用PEFT技术（LoRA、DoRA）微调Whisper模型。

Result: 在NMCPC数据集上，相对最佳基础模型和手工特征基线分别提升了26.4%和63.4%的F1分数；在AIISH数据集上分别提升了6.1%和52.9%。

Conclusion: PEFT微调基础模型在CLP检测和分类任务中表现优异，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: We propose the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of foundation
models for cleft lip and palate (CLP) detection and severity classification. In
CLP, nasalization increases with severity due to the abnormal passage between
the oral and nasal tracts; this causes oral stops to be replaced by glottal
stops and alters formant trajectories and vowel space. Since foundation models
are trained for grapheme prediction or long-term quantized representation
prediction, they may better discriminate CLP severity when fine-tuned on
domain-specific data. We conduct experiments on two datasets: English (NMCPC)
and Kannada (AIISH). We perform a comparative analysis using embeddings from
self-supervised models Wav2Vec2 and WavLM, and the weakly supervised Whisper,
each paired with SVM classifiers, and compare them with traditional handcrafted
features eGeMAPS and ComParE. Finally, we fine-tune the best-performing Whisper
model using PEFT techniques: Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) and Decomposed Low-Rank
Adapter (DoRA). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
relative improvements of 26.4% and 63.4% in macro-average F1 score over the
best foundation model and handcrafted feature baselines on the NMCPC dataset,
and improvements of 6.1% and 52.9% on the AIISH dataset, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化语音合成系统中的所有组件以提升感知指标仍具挑战性，尤其是持续时间预测器尚未被优化。

Method: 采用强化学习方法（GRPO）优化持续时间预测器，并引入教师引导采样以提升多样性和效率。

Result: 在所有指标上表现优于先前系统，同时采样步骤减半且质量无下降。

Conclusion: DMOSpeech 2在多组件指标优化方面迈出了重要一步，为语音合成系统提供了更完整的优化方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-speech (TTS) systems have made remarkable progress in
zero-shot speech synthesis, yet optimizing all components for perceptual
metrics remains challenging. Prior work with DMOSpeech demonstrated direct
metric optimization for speech generation components, but duration prediction
remained unoptimized. This paper presents DMOSpeech 2, which extends metric
optimization to the duration predictor through a reinforcement learning
approach. The proposed system implements a novel duration policy framework
using group relative preference optimization (GRPO) with speaker similarity and
word error rate as reward signals. By optimizing this previously unoptimized
component, DMOSpeech 2 creates a more complete metric-optimized synthesis
pipeline. Additionally, this paper introduces teacher-guided sampling, a hybrid
approach leveraging a teacher model for initial denoising steps before
transitioning to the student model, significantly improving output diversity
while maintaining efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate superior
performance across all metrics compared to previous systems, while reducing
sampling steps by half without quality degradation. These advances represent a
significant step toward speech synthesis systems with metric optimization
across multiple components. The audio samples, code and pre-trained models are

Motivation: 波束成形能提高目标说话者的信噪比，但传统方法依赖模拟混合物训练，与实际混合物不匹配。

Method: 使用真实记录的混合物及其波束成形混合物作为训练对，训练DNN增强输入混合物。

Result: 在CHiME-4数据集上验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能更好地泛化到真实混合物，优于仅依赖模拟混合物的训练。

Abstract: In multi-channel speech enhancement and robust automatic speech recognition
(ASR), beamforming can typically improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the
target speaker and produce reliable enhancement with little distortion to
target speech. With this observation, we propose to leverage beamformed
mixture, which has a higher SNR of the target speaker than the input mixture,
as a weak supervision to train deep neural networks (DNNs) to enhance the input
mixture. This way, we can train enhancement models using pairs of real-recorded
mixture and its beamformed mixture, and potentially realize better
generalization to real mixtures, compared with only training the models on
simulated mixtures, which usually mismatch real mixtures. Evaluation results on
the real-recorded CHiME-4 dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双耳再现方法在VR和远程会议中提供沉浸式体验，但现有BSM算法假设声源为远场，未研究近场场景。

Method: 研究分析了半圆形阵列在刚性球体上的表现，比较了远场和近场BSM设计的性能。

Result: 远场BSM在声源距离阵列数十厘米时表现良好，但更近距离时误差显著增加；近场BSM设计显著减少了误差。

Conclusion: 近场建模在提高双耳再现精度方面具有显著优势，特别是在声源非常接近的情况下。

Abstract: Binaural reproduction methods aim to recreate an acoustic scene for a
listener over headphones, offering immersive experiences in applications such
as Virtual Reality (VR) and teleconferencing. Among the existing approaches,
the Binaural Signal Matching (BSM) algorithm has demonstrated high quality
reproduction due to its signal-independent formulation and the flexibility of
unconstrained array geometry. However, this method assumes far-field sources
and has not yet been investigated for near-field scenarios. This study
evaluates the performance of BSM for near-field sources. Analysis of a
semi-circular array around a rigid sphere, modeling head-mounted devices, show
that far-field BSM performs adequately for sources up to approximately tens of
centimeters from the array. However, for sources closer than this range, the
binaural error increases significantly. Incorporating a near-field BSM design,
which accounts for the source distance, significantly reduces the error,
particularly for these very-close distances, highlighting the benefits of
near-field modeling in improving reproduction accuracy.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法通常需要成对的干信号和混响数据，实际中难以获取。

Method: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯公式的顺序学习策略，通过深度神经网络从混响输入中估计声学参数和干信号，并使用混响匹配损失进行指导。

Result: 最数据高效的变体仅需100个混响参数标记样本即可超越无监督基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在低资源场景下具有有效性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper explores the outcome of training state-ofthe-art dereverberation
models with supervision settings ranging from weakly-supervised to fully
unsupervised, relying solely on reverberant signals and an acoustic model for
training. Most of the existing deep learning approaches typically require
paired dry and reverberant data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. We
develop instead a sequential learning strategy motivated by a bayesian
formulation of the dereverberation problem, wherein acoustic parameters and dry
signals are estimated from reverberant inputs using deep neural networks,
guided by a reverberation matching loss. Our most data-efficient variant
requires only 100 reverberation-parameter-labelled samples to outperform an
unsupervised baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of the
proposed method in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: For many decades, musicologists have engaged in creating large databases
serving different purposes for musicological research and scholarship. With the
rise of fields like music information retrieval and digital musicology, there
is now a constant and growing influx of musicologically relevant datasets and
corpora. In historical or observational settings, however, these datasets are
necessarily incomplete, and the true extent of a collection of interest remains
unknown -- silent. Here, we apply, for the first time, so-called Unseen Species
models (USMs) from ecology to areas of musicological activity. After
introducing the models formally, we show in four case studies how USMs can be
applied to musicological data to address quantitative questions like: How many
composers are we missing in RISM? What percentage of medieval sources of
Gregorian chant have we already cataloged? How many differences in music prints
do we expect to find between editions? How large is the coverage of songs from
genres of a folk music tradition? And, finally, how close are we in estimating
the size of the harmonic vocabulary of a large number of composers?

Conclusion: TDAM-AvgPool模型无需帧级监督即可实现高性能局部深度伪造检测，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Detecting partial deepfake speech is essential due to its potential for
subtle misinformation. However, existing methods depend on costly frame-level
annotations during training, limiting real-world scalability. Also, they focus
on detecting transition artifacts between bonafide and deepfake segments. As
deepfake generation techniques increasingly smooth these transitions, detection
has become more challenging. To address this, our work introduces a new
perspective by analyzing frame-level temporal differences and reveals that
deepfake speech exhibits erratic directional changes and unnatural local
transitions compared to bonafide speech. Based on this finding, we propose a
Temporal Difference Attention Module (TDAM) that redefines partial deepfake
detection as identifying unnatural temporal variations, without relying on
explicit boundary annotations. A dual-level hierarchical difference
representation captures temporal irregularities at both fine and coarse scales,
while adaptive average pooling preserves essential patterns across
variable-length inputs to minimize information loss. Our TDAM-AvgPool model
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an EER of 0.59% on the PartialSpoof
dataset and 0.03% on the HAD dataset, which significantly outperforms the
existing methods without requiring frame-level supervision.

robust speech recognition of atypical speech; an age-adaptive VITS model for
high-fidelity, speaker-aware speech synthesis; and an LLM-driven agent that
automatically generates persona cards and leverages a RAG-based memory system
for conversational consistency. Our experiments, conducted on the SeniorTalk

Abstract: We present a speaker conditioned text-to-speech (TTS) system aimed at
addressing challenges in generating speech for unseen speakers and supporting
diverse Indian languages. Our method leverages a diffusion-based TTS
architecture, where a speaker encoder extracts embeddings from short reference
audio samples to condition the DDPM decoder for multispeaker generation. To
further enhance prosody and naturalness, we employ a cross-attention based
duration prediction mechanism that utilizes reference audio, enabling more
accurate and speaker consistent timing. This results in speech that closely
resembles the target speaker while improving duration modeling and overall
expressiveness. Additionally, to improve zero-shot generation, we employed
classifier free guidance, allowing the system to generate speech more near
speech for unknown speakers. Using this approach, we trained language-specific
speaker-conditioned models. Using the IndicSUPERB dataset for multiple Indian

Method: 引入两个自适应记忆库存储注意力信息，支持实时场景下的注意力持续性。

Result: 实验显示MeMo比基线至少提升2 dB的SI-SNR。

Conclusion: MeMo有效解决了视觉线索缺失时的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Audio-visual Target Speaker Extraction (AV-TSE) aims to isolate a target
speaker's voice from multi-speaker environments by leveraging visual cues as
guidance. However, the performance of AV-TSE systems heavily relies on the
quality of these visual cues. In extreme scenarios where visual cues are
missing or severely degraded, the system may fail to accurately extract the
target speaker. In contrast, humans can maintain attention on a target speaker
even in the absence of explicit auxiliary information. Motivated by such human
cognitive ability, we propose a novel framework called MeMo, which incorporates
two adaptive memory banks to store attention-related information. MeMo is
specifically designed for real-time scenarios: once initial attention is
established, the system maintains attentional momentum over time, even when
visual cues become unavailable. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify
the effectiveness of MeMo. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
framework achieves SI-SNR improvements of at least 2 dB over the corresponding
baseline.

Result: Neuro-MSBG在STOI和PESQ上表现优异（SRCC分别为0.9247和0.8671），并将模拟运行时间缩短46倍。

Conclusion: Neuro-MSBG高效且实用，适用于实时听力损失模拟。

Abstract: Hearing loss simulation models are essential for hearing aid deployment.
However, existing models have high computational complexity and latency, which
limits real-time applications and lack direct integration with speech
processing systems. To address these issues, we propose Neuro-MSBG, a
lightweight end-to-end model with a personalized audiogram encoder for
effective time-frequency modeling. Experiments show that Neuro-MSBG supports
parallel inference and retains the intelligibility and perceptual quality of
the original MSBG, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of
0.9247 for Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) and 0.8671 for
Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ). Neuro-MSBG reduces simulation
runtime by a factor of 46 (from 0.970 seconds to 0.021 seconds for a 1 second
input), further demonstrating its efficiency and practicality.

Abstract: This article presents a method for improving a keyword spotter (KWS)
algorithm in noisy environments. Although beamforming (BF) and adaptive noise
cancellation (ANC) techniques are robust in some conditions, they may degrade
the performance of the activation system by distorting or suppressing useful
signals. The authors propose a neural network architecture that uses several
input channels and an attention mechanism that allows the network to determine
the most useful channel or their combination. The improved quality of the
algorithm was demonstrated on two datasets: from a laboratory with controlled
conditions and from smart speakers in natural conditions. The proposed
algorithm was compared against several baselines in terms of the quality of
noise reduction metrics, KWS metrics, and computing resources in comparison
with existing solutions.

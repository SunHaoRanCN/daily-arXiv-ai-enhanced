Brain networks\nare derived based on functional connectivity and spatial distance between EEG\nchannels. The power spectral density of the channels is then computed for the\nmajor brain wave frequency bands.

We validated the\nsensor on Rappahannock River water, Virginia (less than 0.8 ppm phosphate) at\nsites upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant and benchmarked the\nresults against a commercial phosphate meter. A feed-forward neural network was\ntrained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3,\nzero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for\nriver samples.

However,\nas computing demands continue to increase in size and speed, these wired\ninterconnects can become longer and less effective. One possible solution is to\nenhance the wired interconnects with short-range wireless communication (SRWC),\nwhich offers flexible resource allocation and the ability to broadcast data.\nHowever, implementing SRWC inside a computer chassis presents challenges due to\nmultiple scattering. This scattering stretches the channel impulse response\n(CIR), leading to inter-symbol interference (ISI) and limiting data rates.

We explore the challenges,\napplications, and advantages of ISAC systems in next-generation networks,\nhighlighting the significance of optimizing position and power control. Our\napproach integrates HAPS and UAVs to enhance wireless coverage, particularly in\nremote areas. UAVs function as dual-purpose access points (APs), using their\nmaneuverability and line-of-sight (LoS) aerial-to-ground (A2G) links to\ntransmit combined communication and sensing signals. The scheme operates in two\ntime slots: in the first slot, UAVs transmit dedicated signals to communication\nusers (CUs) and potential targets. UAVs detect targets in specific ground\nlocations and, after signal transmission, receive reflected signals from\ntargets. In the second slot, UAVs relay these signals to HAPS, which performs\nbeamforming to align signals for each CU from various UAVs. UAVs decode\ninformation from HAPS and adjust transmissions to maximize the beam pattern\nefficiency toward the desired targets. We formulate a multi-objective\noptimization problem to maximize both the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for CUs and the echo signal\npower from the targets.

With a given number of PAs, two deployment strategies\nare considered, namely the centralized PA deployment, where all PAs are\nswitched between waveguides to serve users in a time-division manner to avail\nof beamforming gain, and the distributed PA deployment, where a single PA is\ndeployed on each waveguide to simultaneously serve multiple users by leveraging\nthe multiplexing gain. The spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by each deployment\nstrategy is analyzed: i) For the centralized deployment, the positioning\nstrategy of PAs on each waveguide is determined first with the aim of\nmaximizing the channel gain of the corresponding nearest served user. Based on\nthis, the corresponding system SE is derived. ii) For the distributed\ndeployment, the system SE under the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is first\nobtained. To obtain an analytically tractable form, the stationary phase method\nis utilized to approximate the system SE. The approximation result reveals that\nthe average inter-user interference can be negligible with a large waveguide\nspacing and thus the simple MRT is appealing for PA-based multi-user\ncommunications.

In this\nwork, we propose a novel latent-attention based transformer (LAT) decoder for\npolar codes that addresses the limitations on performance and generalization\nthrough three pivotal innovations. First, we develop a latent-attention\nmechanism that supersedes the conventional self-attention mechanism. This\narchitectural modification enables independent learning of the Query and Key\nmatrices for code-aware attention computation, decoupling them from the Value\nmatrix to emphasize position-wise decoding interactions while reducing context\ncorrelation interference. Second, we devise an advanced training framework\nincorporating three synergistic components: entropy-aware importance sampling\nthat emphasizes low-probability regions in the signal constellation space,\nexperience reflow that introduces empirical labels to improve characterization\nof decoding boundaries, and dynamic label smoothing for likelihood-based\nregularization.

How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best\nperformance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds\non the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is\nmeasured in terms of the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and\ncommunications performance is measured in terms of the\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires\nat most $K + \\sqrt{\\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the\nability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling\ninterference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes\n$\\sqrt{K^2 + \\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound\non the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task\nindividually. These results can be extended to sensing tasks for which the\nperformance is measured as a function of $d$ quadratic terms in the\nbeamformers. In this case, the bound becomes $K + \\sqrt{d}$ and $\\sqrt{K^2 +\nd}$, respectively. Specifically, for estimating complex path losses and\nangles-of-arrival of $N_\\text{tr}$ targets while communicating to $K$ users,\nthe bound on the minimum number of beamformers scales linearly in $K$ and in\n$N_\\text{tr}$, assuming interference from sensing can be cancelled. When\ninterference cancellation is not possible, the following exact characterization\nfor the case of $N_\\text{tr} = 1$ can be obtained: when $K=0$ or $1$, two\nbeamformers should be used; when $K \\ge 2$, exactly $K$ beamformers should be\nused, i.e., communication beamformers alone are already sufficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u5668\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Cram\u00e9r-Rao\u754c\u8861\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e72\u6270\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\u8861\u91cf\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u65f6\uff0c\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u754c\u9650\u4e3a\u221a(K\u00b2 + L(L+1)/2)\uff1b\u6709\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u65f6\u4e3aK + \u221a(L(L+1)/2)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u754c\u9650\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u548c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u901a\u4fe1\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u5668\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u3002"}}

We shall study the transceiver design in\nover-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting\nthe power constraints of the transceivers. The main challenge lies in the\nintractability of the learning performance analysis, as well as the non-convex\nnature and the optimization spanning the whole FD training period. To tackle\nthis problem, we first derive an analytical expression of the convergence rate\nin over-the-air FD. Then, the closed-form optimal solutions of the WDs'\ntransmit power and the estimator for over-the-air aggregation are obtained\ngiven the receiver combining strategy. Accordingly, we put forth an efficient\napproach to find the optimal receiver beamforming vector via semidefinite\nrelaxation. We further prove that there is no optimality gap between the\noriginal and relaxed problem for the receiver beamforming design. Numerical\nresults will show that the proposed over-the-air FD approach achieves a\nsignificant reduction in communication overhead, with only a minor compromise\nin testing accuracy compared to conventional FL benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\uff08FD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578bAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4f7f\u73b0\u6709FL\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\u800c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5740\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u805a\u5408\u8bbe\u5907\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u8bbe\u5907\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

One of the great strengths\nof wireless networks based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)\nis the ease with which different non-overlapping time-frequency (TF) resources\ncan be allocated to different users by simply shifting each user's signal in\ntime and frequency. However, a significant weaknesses of OFDM is the\ninflexibility of sub-carrier spacing. Since OFDM does not allow users to have\ndifferent sub-carrier spacing, a single user subject to inter-carrier\ninterference causes carrier spacing to increase for all users. Zak-OTFS is an\nalternative delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme, where, in contrast to\nOFDM, the Input-Output (I/O) relation is predictable. We match the strength of\nOFDM by designing a novel DD domain method of shaping the transmitted Zak-OTFS\npulse on the uplink that enables flexible non-overlapping TF resource\nallocation. The base station (BS) receives a superposition of uplink signals\nand applies individual matched filters to obtain the data specific to\nindividual users. We develop theoretical measures of interference between\nusers, and present numerical simulations for a vehicular channel model\nrepresentative of next generation propagation environments. We demonstrate\nsingle-user performance in a multiuser Zak-OTFS uplink system without needing\nto provision guard bands between TF resources allocated to different users.\nThese performance results demonstrate that the benefits of a predictable\nZak-OTFS waveform can be realized within an architecture for uplink\ncommunication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eZak-OTFS\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\uff08DD\uff09\u57df\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86OFDM\u4e2d\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u95f4\u9694\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\u9891\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7528\u6237\u9700\u8981\u5171\u4eab\u9891\u8c31\u3002OFDM\u867d\u7136\u6613\u4e8e\u5206\u914d\u65f6\u9891\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u95f4\u9694\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5355\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8f7d\u6ce2\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u6709\u7528\u6237\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684DD\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574Zak-OTFS\u8109\u51b2\u5f62\u72b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\u9891\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002\u57fa\u7ad9\u901a\u8fc7\u5339\u914d\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5206\u79bb\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0cZak-OTFS\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u4fdd\u62a4\u9891\u5e26\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u7528\u6237\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Zak-OTFS\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6ce2\u5f62\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u5728\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u901a\u4fe1\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

With high-frequency bands and large-scale antenna\narrays, the Rayleigh distance extends, necessitating near-field (NF) models\nwhere waves are spherical. Although NF-ISAC improves both sensing and\ncommunication, it also poses challenges such as high data volume and potential\nprivacy risks. To address these, we propose a novel framework: near-field\nintegrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (NF-ISCSC), which\nleverages semantic communication to transmit contextual information only,\nthereby reducing data overhead and improving efficiency. However, semantic\ncommunication is sensitive to channel variations, requiring adaptive\nmechanisms. To this end, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced to support the\nNF-ISCSC system, enabling dynamic adaptability to changing channels. The\nproposed FA-enabled NF-ISCSC framework considers multiple communication users\nand extended targets comprising several scatterers. A joint optimization\nproblem is formulated to maximize data rate while accounting for sensing\nquality, computational load, and power budget. Using an alternating\noptimization (AO) approach, the original problem is divided into three\nsub-problems: ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction ratio.\nBeamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation method. FA\npositioning is solved via a projected Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)\nalgorithm, and the semantic extraction ratio is optimized using bisection\nsearch. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves\nhigher data rates and better privacy preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff08NF-ISCSC\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\uff08FAs\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08NF-ISAC\uff09\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5927\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNF-ISCSC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165FAs\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "conclusion": "NF-ISCSC\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

ISCC is particularly attractive for vehicle-to-everything (V2X)\napplications, where vehicles perform ISAC to sense the environment and\nsimultaneously offload the sensing data to roadside base stations (BSs) for\nremote processing. In this paper, we investigate a particular ISCC-enabled V2X\nsystem consisting of multiple multi-antenna BSs serving a set of single-antenna\nvehicles, in which the vehicles perform their respective ISAC operations (for\nsimultaneous sensing and offloading to the associated BS) over orthogonal\nsub-bands. With the focus on fairly minimizing the sensing completion latency\nfor vehicles while ensuring the detection probability constraints, we jointly\noptimize the allocations of radio resources (i.e., the sub-band allocation,\ntransmit power control at vehicles, and receive beamforming at BSs) as well as\ncomputation resources at BS MEC servers. To solve the formulated complex\nmixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose an alternating\noptimization algorithm. In this algorithm, we determine the sub-band allocation\nvia the branch-and-bound method, optimize the transmit power control via\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA), and derive the receive beamforming and\ncomputation resource allocation at BSs in closed form based on generalized\nRayleigh entropy and fairness criteria, respectively. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed joint resource allocation design significantly\nreduces the maximum task completion latency among all vehicles. Furthermore, we\nalso demonstrate several interesting trade-offs between the system performance\nand resource utilizations."}

To\naddress this issue, we propose a cascaded method for text-to-multisource\nbinaural audio generation (TTMBA) with both temporal and spatial control.\nFirst, a pretrained large language model (LLM) segments the text into a\nstructured format with time and spatial details for each sound event. Next, a\npretrained mono audio generation network creates multiple mono audios with\nvarying durations for each event. These mono audios are transformed into\nbinaural audios using a binaural rendering neural network based on spatial data\nfrom the LLM. Finally, the binaural audios are arranged by their start times,\nresulting in multisource binaural audio. Experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method in terms of both audio generation quality\nand spatial perceptual accuracy."}

Typical RIS implementations include\nmetasurfaces with passive unit elements capable to reflect their incident waves\nin controllable ways. However, this solely reflective operation induces\nsignificant challenges in the RIS orchestration from the wireless network. For\nexample, channel estimation, which is essential for coherent RIS-empowered\nwireless communications, is quite challenging with the available solely\nreflecting RIS designs. This chapter reviews the emerging concept of Hybrid\nReflecting and Sensing RISs (HRISs), which enables metasurfaces to reflect the\nimpinging signal in a controllable manner, while simultaneously sensing a\nportion of it. The sensing capability of HRISs facilitates various network\nmanagement functionalities, including channel parameter estimation and\nlocalization, while, most importantly, giving rise to computationally\nautonomous and self-configuring RISs. The implementation details of HRISs are\nfirst presented, which are then followed by a convenient mathematical model for\ncharacterizing their dual functionality. Then, two indicative applications of\nHRISs are discussed, one for simultaneous communications and sensing and\nanother that showcases their usefulness for estimating the individual channels\nin the uplink of a multi-user HRIS-empowered communication system. For both of\nthese applications, performance evaluation results are included validating the\nrole of HRISs for sensing as well as integrated sensing and communications."}

SALM\nconsists of a text encoder and a dual-branch audio encoder, decomposing spatial\nsound into semantic and spatial components through structured audio embeddings.\nKey features of SALM include seamless alignment of spatial and text\nrepresentations, separate and joint extraction of spatial and semantic\ninformation, zero-shot direction classification and robust support for spatial\naudio editing.

This work\nfocuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and\ncarrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical\nthreshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major\npeak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest\npeak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the\nproposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique\nreduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into\nmultiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to\neffectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO\nestimates for all the users."}

Due\nto the limitations of physically moving radiating elements, electronically\nreconfigurable antennas are emerging as practical implementations of FASs,\nsince changing the radiation pattern is functionally equivalent to physically\nmoving the device. However, electronically reconfigurable antennas pose a\nchallenge in terms of analytical modeling, often requiring full-wave\nsimulations or measurements for their characterization; this severely limits\nthe extraction of theoretical insights useful for system design. Motivated by\nthese difficulties and the growing interest in FASs, we propose in this paper a\ncomplete analytical model for metasurface-based embodiments of FASs.\nSpecifically, we advocate for the implementation of the FAS concept through\ndynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), hitherto proposed as array replacements in\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We leverage circuit theory to\nrewrite the conventional signal model of FASs in terms of admittance matrices\naccounting for the electromagnetic effects inherent to metasurfaces.

Expanding upon the\ntheoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this\npaper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying\nthe deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative\nto the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)\nmodel is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite\nchannels.

The correctness\nof the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo\nsimulations and urban canyon tests. The findings indicate that the maximum PVT\nbias depends on the largest multipath errors observed across various satellite\nchannels.

In this paper, a novel indirect PS scheme tailored\nfor peak power constrained (PPC) IM-DD systems is proposed. The key idea lies\nin strategically controlling the signal envelope to mitigate memory-induced\nimpairments, such as nonlinearity, overshoot, peak-to-average power ratio\nenhancement, etc. The proposed scheme incorporates a dynamic selective mapping\n(DSLM) mechanism at the transmitter, enabling an untypical bit-to-symbol\nmapping in which the current symbol is not only determined by the current bits\npattern but also by previously generated symbols within a specified memory\nlength. At the receiver side, a turbo equalizer with a modified M-BCJR\nalgorithm is proposed to achieve the recovery of ambiguous bits induced by\nDSLM. Experimental verification in a 56GBaud PAM8 system demonstrates that the\nproposed scheme exhibits 1dB receiver sensitivity improvement over 2km\nsingle-mode fiber transmission.

DIFFA integrates a frozen diffusion\nlanguage model with a lightweight dual-adapter architecture that bridges speech\nunderstanding and natural language reasoning. We employ a two-stage training\npipeline: first, aligning semantic representations via an ASR objective; then,\nlearning instruction-following abilities through synthetic audio-caption pairs\nautomatically generated by prompting LLMs. Despite being trained on only 960\nhours of ASR and 127 hours of synthetic instruction data, DIFFA demonstrates\ncompetitive performance on major benchmarks, including MMSU, MMAU, and\nVoiceBench, outperforming several autoregressive open-source baselines. Our\nresults reveal the potential of diffusion-based language models for efficient\nand scalable audio understanding, opening a new direction for speech-driven AI.\nOur code will be available at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/DIFFA.git."}

Accepted to the IEEE International Symposium on\n  Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC) 2025", "summary": "Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the\ncharacteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model\nrequires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often\ndifficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO\nprecoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter\nwhile dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy\nconsumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model\nsignificantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean\nsquared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation\nin data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds\ntraining samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine\nsimilarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work\nenables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing\nchallenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability\nto dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher\nlevel resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over\nenergy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness."}

Although speculative decoding has\nbeen explored for better decoding efficiency, they usually ignore the key\ncharacteristics of the ASR task and achieve limited speedup. To further reduce\nthe real-time ASR latency, in this paper, we propose a novel speculative\ndecoding framework specialized for ASR, dubbed SpecASR. SpecASR is developed\nbased on our core observation that ASR decoding is audio-conditioned, which\nresults in high output alignment between small and large ASR models, even given\noutput mismatches in intermediate decoding steps. Therefore, SpecASR features\nan adaptive draft sequence generation process that dynamically modifies the\ndraft sequence length to maximize the token acceptance length. SpecASR further\nproposes a draft sequence recycling strategy that reuses the previously\ngenerated draft sequence to reduce the draft ASR model latency. Moreover, a\ntwo-pass sparse token tree generation algorithm is also proposed to balance the\nlatency of draft and target ASR models. With extensive experimental results, we\ndemonstrate SpecASR achieves 3.04x-3.79x and 1.25x-1.84x speedup over the\nbaseline autoregressive decoding and speculative decoding, respectively,\nwithout any loss in recognition accuracy."}

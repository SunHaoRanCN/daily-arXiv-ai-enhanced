Prior work can be categorized\ninto two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then\ncluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods\nincorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection.\nHowever, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve\nsegmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in\nwhether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up\nstrategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent\nself-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a\nlexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic\nprogramming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On\nthe five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable\nstate-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times\nfaster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of\nES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate\nboundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as\nwell.

These distortions include background noise,\nreverberation, bandwidth limitations, signal clipping, and network packet loss.\nExisting methods typically focus on optimizing for a single type of distortion,\noften struggling to effectively handle the simultaneous presence of multiple\ndistortions in complex scenarios. OmniGSE bridges this gap by integrating the\nstrengths of discriminative and generative approaches through a two-stage\narchitecture that enables cross-domain collaborative optimization. In the first\nstage, continuous features are enhanced using a lightweight channel-split\nNAC-RoFormer. In the second stage, discrete tokens are generated to reconstruct\nhigh-quality speech through language models. Specifically, we designed a\nhierarchical language model structure consisting of a RootLM and multiple\nBranchLMs. The RootLM models general acoustic features across codebook layers,\nwhile the BranchLMs explicitly capture the progressive relationships between\ndifferent codebook levels.

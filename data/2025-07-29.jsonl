Besides, the realization of a cell-free network is considered\nto be a gradual long-term evolutionary process in which cell-free APs will be\nincrementally introduced into existing cellular networks, and form a hybrid\ncommunication network with the existing cellular base stations (BSs). Such a\ncollaboration will bridge the gap between the established cellular network and\nthe innovative cellfree network.

While wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology is commonly used for UAV RC\nlinks, ISM-based long-term evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation (5G)\ntechnologies have also been recently considered for the same purpose. A major\nproblem for UAV RC links in the ISM bands is that other types of interference\nsources, such as legacy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmissions, may degrade the link\nquality. Such interference problems are a higher concern for the UAV in the air\nthan the RC unit on the ground due to the UAV being in line-of-sight (LoS) with\na larger number of interference sources. To obtain empirical evidence of the\nasymmetric interference conditions in downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), we first\nconducted a measurement campaign using a helikite platform in urban and rural\nareas at NC State University. The results from this measurement campaign show\nthat the aggregate interference can be up to 16.66 dB at higher altitudes up to\n170 m, compared with the interference observed at a ground receiver. As a\nresult of this asymmetric UL interference, lost hybrid automatic repeat request\n(HARQ) indicators (ACK/NACK) in the UL may degrade the DL throughput. To\ninvestigate this, we study various HARQ mechanisms, including HARQ Type-I with\nno combining, HARQ Type-I with chase combining, HARQ Type-III with incremental\nredundancy, and burst transmission with chase combining. To evaluate the impact\nof asymmetric UL interference on throughput performance, we consider three\nsteps of evaluation process: 1) standalone physical DL shared channel (PDSCH)\nthroughput evaluation with perfect ACK/NACK assumption; 2) standalone physical\nUL control channel (PUCCH) decoding reliability evaluation; and 3) PDSCH DL\nthroughput evaluation with asymmetric UL ACK/NACK transmission."}

The order of AFXs in a chain\nplays a crucial role in determining the final sound, particularly when\nnon-linear (e.g., distortion) or time-variant (e.g., chorus) processors are\ninvolved. Despite its importance, most AFX-related studies have primarily\nfocused on estimating effect types and their parameters from a wet signal. To\naddress this gap, we formulate AFX chain recognition as the task of jointly\nestimating AFX types and their order from a wet signal. We propose a\nneural-network-based method that embeds wet signals into a hyperbolic space and\nclassifies their AFX chains. Hyperbolic space can represent tree-structured\ndata more efficiently than Euclidean space due to its exponential expansion\nproperty. Since AFX chains can be represented as trees, with AFXs as nodes and\nedges encoding effect order, hyperbolic space is well-suited for modeling the\nexponentially growing and non-commutative nature of ordered AFX combinations,\nwhere changes in effect order can result in different final sounds. Experiments\nusing guitar sounds demonstrate that, with an appropriate curvature, the\nproposed method outperforms its Euclidean counterpart.

This\npaper presents a new solution to these challenges, through a FPGA-accelerated\nextreme lightweight model along with a newly proposed knowledge distillation\nframework. The proposed three-layer depthwise separable convolution network\ncontains only 4141 parameters, which is the most compact architecture in this\nfield to date, and achieves a maximum processing speed of 0.019 ms for each\nsample covering a 12.5 m fiber length over 0.256 s.

To improve generalizability under changing environments, the\nproposed cross-domain distillation framework guided by physical priors is used\nhere to embed frequency-domain insights into the time-domain model. This allows\nfor time-frequency representation learning without increasing complexity and\nboosts recognition accuracy from 51.93% to 95.72% under unseen environmental\nconditions.

However, traditional signal\nprocessing methods face significant challenges in complex underwater\nenvironments due to noise, reverberation, and interference. To address these\nissues, this paper presents a deep learning-based active sonar target detection\nmethod that decomposes the detection process into separate angle and distance\nestimation tasks. Active sonar target detection employs deep learning models to\npredict target distance and angle, with the final target position determined by\nintegrating these estimates. Limited underwater acoustic data hinders effective\nmodel training, but transfer learning and simulation offer practical solutions\nto this challenge. Experimental results verify that the method achieves\neffective and robust performance under challenging conditions."}

Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align\ntheir TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and\nrenewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these\ngaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users\ninput text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems,\nand their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena\nfollows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with\nkey features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the\nheterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed*\npreferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also\npropose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a\nrenewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency.\nThrough its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies,\nand music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in\nthe TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully\nadapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.\n  Music Arena is available at: https://music-arena.org"}

To\nsupport this task, we present a synthetic benchmark dataset, called the\nBinaural Set, which simulates realistic auditory scenes using measured\nhead-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and diverse sound events. To\neffectively address the BiSELD task, we propose a new input feature\nrepresentation called the Binaural Time-Frequency Feature (BTFF), which encodes\ninteraural time difference (ITD), interaural level difference (ILD), and\nhigh-frequency spectral cues (SC) from binaural signals. BTFF is composed of\neight channels, including left and right mel-spectrograms, velocity-maps,\nSC-maps, and ITD-/ILD-maps, designed to cover different spatial cues across\nfrequency bands and spatial axes. A CRNN-based model, BiSELDnet, is then\ndeveloped to learn both spectro-temporal patterns and HRTF-based localization\ncues from BTFF. Experiments on the Binaural Set show that each BTFF sub-feature\nenhances task performance: V-map improves detection, ITD-/ILD-maps enable\naccurate horizontal localization, and SC-map captures vertical spatial cues.\nThe final system achieves a SELD error of 0.110 with 87.1% F-score and\n4.4{\\deg} localization error, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework in mimicking human-like auditory perception."}

Unlike conventional\napproaches that employ selective frequency filtering or track individual\nharmonics, the proposed method enhances the global periodic structure of the\nspectrum via nonlinear correlation processing. Specifically, smoothing and\nsecond-derivative operations are first applied to the radar displacement signal\nto suppress noise and accentuate higher-order heartbeat harmonics. Rather than\nisolating specific frequency components, we compute localized autocorrelations\nof the Fourier spectrum around the harmonic frequencies. The incoherent\nsummation of these autocorrelations yields a pseudo-spectrum in which the\nfundamental heartbeat periodicity is distinctly emphasized. This nonlinear\napproach mitigates the effects of respiratory harmonics and noise, enabling\nrobust interbeat interval estimation. Experiments with radar measurements from\nfive participants demonstrate that the proposed method reduces root-mean-square\nerror by 20% and improves the correlation coefficient by 0.20 relative to\nconventional techniques."}

Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often\nproduce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels,\nlimiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced\naudio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend\non anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous\nexamples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nsynthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual\ndescriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions,\nconverting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds.\nWe validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal\nsounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data.\nExperimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty\nacross machine types between synthetic and real anomalies.

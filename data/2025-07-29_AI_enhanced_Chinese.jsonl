Despite\nrecent advances in the performance analysis and optimization of cellfree\nwireless networks, it remains an open question whether large-scale deployment\nof APs in existing wireless networks can cost-effectively achieve communication\ncapacity growth.

Such a\ncollaboration will bridge the gap between the established cellular network and\nthe innovative cellfree network. Therefore, hybrid cellular and cell-free\nnetworks (HCCNs) emerge as a practical and feasible solution for advancing\ncell-free network development, and it is worthwhile to further explore its\nperformance limits. This paper presents a stochastic geometry-based hybrid\ncellular and cell-free network model to analyze the distributions of signal and\ninterference and reveal their mutual coupling. Specifically, in order to\nbenefit the UEs from both the cellular BSs and the cell-free APs, a conjugate\nbeamforming design is employed, and the aggregated signal is analyzed using\nmoment matching.

Accurate and low-complexity channel estimation is one\nof the most critical challenges for massive multiple input multiple\noutput~(MIMO) ODDM systems, mainly due to the extremely large antenna arrays\nand high-mobility environments. To overcome these challenges, this paper\naddresses the issue of channel estimation in downlink massive MIMO-ODDM systems\nand proposes a low-complexity algorithm based on memory approximate message\npassing~(MAMP) to estimate the channel state information~(CSI). Specifically,\nwe first establish the effective channel model of the massive MIMO-ODDM\nsystems, where the magnitudes of the elements in the equivalent channel vector\nfollow a Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution. Further, as the number of antennas\ngrows, the elements in the equivalent coefficient matrix tend to become\ncompletely random.

This paper\ninvestigates the system design for energy-saving unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)\nformations in dual-functional LAWNs, where a ground base station (GBS)\nsimultaneously wirelessly controls multiple UAV formations and performs sensing\ntasks. To enhance flight endurance, we exploit the aerodynamic upwash effects\nand propose a distributed energy-saving formation framework based on the\nadapt-then-combine (ATC) diffusion least mean square (LMS) algorithm.\nSpecifically, each UAV updates the local position estimate by invoking the LMS\nalgorithm, followed by refining it through cooperative information exchange\nwith neighbors. This enables an optimized aerodynamic structure that minimizes\nthe formation's overall energy consumption. To ensure control stability and\nfairness, we formulate a maximum linear quadratic regulator (LQR) minimization\nproblem, which is subject to both the available power budget and the required\nsensing beam pattern gain. To address this non-convex problem, we develop a\ntwo-step approach by first deriving a closed-form expression of LQR as a\nfunction of arbitrary beamformers. Subsequently, an efficient iterative\nalgorithm that integrates successive convex approximation (SCA) and\nsemidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques is proposed to obtain a sub-optimal\ndual-functional beamforming solution.

To\nsupport this task, we present a synthetic benchmark dataset, called the\nBinaural Set, which simulates realistic auditory scenes using measured\nhead-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and diverse sound events. To\neffectively address the BiSELD task, we propose a new input feature\nrepresentation called the Binaural Time-Frequency Feature (BTFF), which encodes\ninteraural time difference (ITD), interaural level difference (ILD), and\nhigh-frequency spectral cues (SC) from binaural signals. BTFF is composed of\neight channels, including left and right mel-spectrograms, velocity-maps,\nSC-maps, and ITD-/ILD-maps, designed to cover different spatial cues across\nfrequency bands and spatial axes. A CRNN-based model, BiSELDnet, is then\ndeveloped to learn both spectro-temporal patterns and HRTF-based localization\ncues from BTFF.

While wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology is commonly used for UAV RC\nlinks, ISM-based long-term evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation (5G)\ntechnologies have also been recently considered for the same purpose. A major\nproblem for UAV RC links in the ISM bands is that other types of interference\nsources, such as legacy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmissions, may degrade the link\nquality. Such interference problems are a higher concern for the UAV in the air\nthan the RC unit on the ground due to the UAV being in line-of-sight (LoS) with\na larger number of interference sources. To obtain empirical evidence of the\nasymmetric interference conditions in downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), we first\nconducted a measurement campaign using a helikite platform in urban and rural\nareas at NC State University. The results from this measurement campaign show\nthat the aggregate interference can be up to 16.66 dB at higher altitudes up to\n170 m, compared with the interference observed at a ground receiver. As a\nresult of this asymmetric UL interference, lost hybrid automatic repeat request\n(HARQ) indicators (ACK/NACK) in the UL may degrade the DL throughput. To\ninvestigate this, we study various HARQ mechanisms, including HARQ Type-I with\nno combining, HARQ Type-I with chase combining, HARQ Type-III with incremental\nredundancy, and burst transmission with chase combining. To evaluate the impact\nof asymmetric UL interference on throughput performance, we consider three\nsteps of evaluation process: 1) standalone physical DL shared channel (PDSCH)\nthroughput evaluation with perfect ACK/NACK assumption; 2) standalone physical\nUL control channel (PUCCH) decoding reliability evaluation; and 3) PDSCH DL\nthroughput evaluation with asymmetric UL ACK/NACK transmission.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u5728ISM\u9891\u6bb5\u4e2d\u9065\u63a7\uff08RC\uff09\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\uff08UL\uff09\u548c\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\uff08DL\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e72\u6270\u5bf9\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9065\u63a7\u94fe\u8def\u5728ISM\u9891\u6bb5\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u5e72\u6270\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u6c26\u6c14\u7403\u5e73\u53f0\uff09\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540cHARQ\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e72\u6270\u5bf9\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u9ad8\u7a7a\u5e72\u6270\u6bd4\u5730\u9762\u9ad816.66 dB\uff0c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8defACK/NACK\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u5e72\u6270\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9065\u63a7\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316HARQ\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002"}}

We evaluate our approach on four\nchallenging public benchmarks and report generalization performance. All fusion\nvariants consistently outperform an SSL only baseline, with the cross attention\nstrategy achieving the best generalization with a 38% relative reduction in\nequal error rate (EER).

The order of AFXs in a chain\nplays a crucial role in determining the final sound, particularly when\nnon-linear (e.g., distortion) or time-variant (e.g., chorus) processors are\ninvolved. Despite its importance, most AFX-related studies have primarily\nfocused on estimating effect types and their parameters from a wet signal. To\naddress this gap, we formulate AFX chain recognition as the task of jointly\nestimating AFX types and their order from a wet signal. We propose a\nneural-network-based method that embeds wet signals into a hyperbolic space and\nclassifies their AFX chains. Hyperbolic space can represent tree-structured\ndata more efficiently than Euclidean space due to its exponential expansion\nproperty. Since AFX chains can be represented as trees, with AFXs as nodes and\nedges encoding effect order, hyperbolic space is well-suited for modeling the\nexponentially growing and non-commutative nature of ordered AFX combinations,\nwhere changes in effect order can result in different final sounds. Experiments\nusing guitar sounds demonstrate that, with an appropriate curvature, the\nproposed method outperforms its Euclidean counterpart.

However,\ntheir practical deployment remains hindered by two major challenges:\ndegradation of recognition accuracy in dynamic conditions, and the\ncomputational bottleneck of real-time processing for mass sensing data. This\npaper presents a new solution to these challenges, through a FPGA-accelerated\nextreme lightweight model along with a newly proposed knowledge distillation\nframework. The proposed three-layer depthwise separable convolution network\ncontains only 4141 parameters, which is the most compact architecture in this\nfield to date, and achieves a maximum processing speed of 0.019 ms for each\nsample covering a 12.5 m fiber length over 0.256 s. This performance\ncorresponds to real-time processing capabilities for sensing fibers extending\nup to 168.68 km. To improve generalizability under changing environments, the\nproposed cross-domain distillation framework guided by physical priors is used\nhere to embed frequency-domain insights into the time-domain model. This allows\nfor time-frequency representation learning without increasing complexity and\nboosts recognition accuracy from 51.93% to 95.72% under unseen environmental\nconditions. The proposed methodology provides key advancements including a\nframework combining interpretable signal processing technique with deep\nlearning and a reference architecture for real-time processing and\nedge-computing in DVS systems, and more general distributed optical fiber\nsensing (DOFS) area. It mitigates the trade-off between sensing range and\nreal-time capability, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and\npractical deployment requirements.

Unlike conventional\napproaches that employ selective frequency filtering or track individual\nharmonics, the proposed method enhances the global periodic structure of the\nspectrum via nonlinear correlation processing. Specifically, smoothing and\nsecond-derivative operations are first applied to the radar displacement signal\nto suppress noise and accentuate higher-order heartbeat harmonics. Rather than\nisolating specific frequency components, we compute localized autocorrelations\nof the Fourier spectrum around the harmonic frequencies. The incoherent\nsummation of these autocorrelations yields a pseudo-spectrum in which the\nfundamental heartbeat periodicity is distinctly emphasized. This nonlinear\napproach mitigates the effects of respiratory harmonics and noise, enabling\nrobust interbeat interval estimation.

Results show a strong correlation between analytical\nand measured supercapacitor voltage profiles, confirming the proposed model's\naccuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7535\u6c60\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u4e0e\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u65e0\u7535\u6c60\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7efc\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u4e0e\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u539f\u578b\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8d85\u7ea7\u7535\u5bb9\u7535\u538b\u66f2\u7ebf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u7535\u6c60\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

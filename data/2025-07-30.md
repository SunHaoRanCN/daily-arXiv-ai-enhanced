### [1] [DOA Estimation via Continuous Aperture Arrays: MUSIC and CRLB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21347)
*Haonan Si,Zhaolin Wang,Xiansheng Guo,Jin Zhang,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了使用连续孔径阵列（CAPA）进行方向到达（DOA）估计的方法，提出了一种新的MUSIC算法，解决了传统算法不适用的问题，并通过理论分析和数值结果验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统空间离散阵列（SPDA）在DOA估计中自由度有限，而CAPA虽然能显著提升自由度，但其连续信号特性使得传统估计算法不适用。

Method: 提出了一种新的MUSIC算法，通过等效连续-离散变换实现连续算子的特征分解，并利用高斯-勒让德积分近似MUSIC谱以降低计算复杂度。

Result: 理论证明CAPA显著提高了DOA估计精度，数值结果验证了所提MUSIC算法的有效性，实现了接近最优的估计性能且计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: CAPA结合新MUSIC算法在DOA估计中表现出色，优于传统SPDA，同时保持了低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using continuous aperture array (CAPA)
is studied. Compared to the conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), CAPA
significantly enhances the spatial degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs) for DOA
estimation, but its infinite-dimensional continuous signals render the
conventional estimation algorithm non-applicable. To address this challenge, a
new multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is proposed for CAPAs. In
particular, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation is proposed to
facilitate the eigendecomposition of continuous operators. Subsequently, the
MUSIC spectrum is accurately approximated using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature,
effectively reducing the computational complexity. Furthermore, the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for DOA estimation using CAPAs are analyzed
for both cases with and without priori knowledge of snapshot signals. It is
theoretically proved that CAPAs significantly improve the DOA estimation
accuracy compared to traditional SPDAs. Numerical results further validate this
insight and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MUSIC algorithm for
CAPA. The proposed method achieves near-optimal estimation performance while
maintaining a low computational complexity.

Abstract: The rapid advancement in large foundation models is propelling the paradigm
shifts across various industries. One significant change is that agents,
instead of traditional machines or humans, will be the primary participants in
the future production process, which consequently requires a novel AI-native
communication system tailored for agent communications. Integrating the ability
of large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented semantic communication is a
potential approach. However, the output of existing LLM is human language,
which is highly constrained and sub-optimal for agent-type communication. In
this paper, we innovatively propose a task-oriented agent communication system.
Specifically, we leverage the original LLM to learn a specialized machine
language represented by token embeddings. Simultaneously, a multi-modal LLM is
trained to comprehend the application task and to extract essential implicit
information from multi-modal inputs, subsequently expressing it using machine
language tokens. This representation is significantly more efficient for
transmission over the air interface. Furthermore, to reduce transmission
overhead, we introduce a joint token and channel coding (JTCC) scheme that
compresses the token sequence by exploiting its sparsity while enhancing
robustness against channel noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach reduces transmission overhead for downstream tasks while enhancing
accuracy relative to the SOTA methods.

### [3] [Two-Dimensional Nonseparable Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21511)
*Daxiang Li,Zhichao Zhang,Wei Yao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的二维非可分离分数傅里叶变换（NSFRFT），解决了现有二维FRFT的局限性，并在应用中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有二维FRFT存在理论不统一、无法处理非可分离信号以及缺乏与二维Wigner分布的一致性旋转关系等问题，限制了其在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 提出了一种更通用的二维NSFRFT定义，具有四个自由度，并推导了其性质，同时提出了三种离散算法，其中两种是快速算法。

Result: 数值模拟和实验表明，2D NSFRFT在图像加密、解密、滤波和去噪等应用中表现优越。

Conclusion: 2D NSFRFT是一种更通用的方法，能够克服现有二维FRFT的局限性，并在实际应用中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) generalizes the
1D Fourier transform, offering significant advantages in time-frequency
analysis of non-stationary signals. To extend the benefits of the 1D FRFT to
higher-dimensional signals, 2D FRFTs, such as the 2D separable FRFT (SFRFT),
gyrator transform (GT), and coupled FRFT (CFRFT), have been developed. However,
existing 2D FRFTs suffer from several limitations: (1) a lack of theoretical
uniformity and general applicability, (2) an inability to handle 2D
non-stationary signals with nonseparable terms, and (3) failure to maintain a
consistent 4D rotational relationship with the 2D Wigner distribution (WD),
which is essential for ensuring geometric consistency and symmetry in
time-frequency analysis. These limitations restrict the methods' performance in
practical applications, such as radar, communication, sonar, and optical
imaging, in which nonseparable terms frequently arise. To address these
challenges, we introduce a more general definition of the 2D FRFT, termed the
2D nonseparable FRFT (NSFRFT). The 2D NSFRFT has four degrees of freedom,
includes the 2D SFRFT, GT, and CFRFT as special cases, and maintains a more
general 4D rotational relationship with the 2D WD. We derive its properties and
present three discrete algorithms, two of which are fast algorithms with
computational complexity $O(N^2 \log N)$ comparable to that of the 2D SFRFT.
Numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
the 2D NSFRFT in applications such as image encryption, decryption, filtering,
and denoising.

### [4] [Trainable Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21527)

Abstract: To address limitations of the graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT)
Wiener filtering and the traditional joint time-vertex fractional Fourier
transform (JFRFT) Wiener filtering, this study proposes a filtering method
based on the hyper-differential form of the JFRFT. The gradient backpropagation
mechanism is employed to enable the adaptive selection of transform order pair
and filter coefficients. First, leveraging the hyper-differential form of the
GFRFT and the fractional Fourier transform, the hyper-differential form of the
JFRFT is constructed and its properties are analyzed. Second, time-varying
graph signals are divided into dynamic graph sequences of equal span along the
temporal dimension. A spatiotemporal joint representation is then established
through vectorized reorganization, followed by the joint time-vertex Wiener
filtering. Furthermore, by rigorously proving the differentiability of the
transform orders, both the transform orders and filter coefficients are
embedded as learnable parameters within a neural network architecture. Through
gradient backpropagation, their synchronized iterative optimization is
achieved, constructing a parameters-adaptive learning filtering framework. This
method leverages a model-driven approach to learn the optimal transform order
pair and filter coefficients. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
framework improves the time-varying graph signals denoising performance, while
reducing the computational burden of the traditional grid search strategy.

### [5] [Causal Link Discovery with Unequal Edge Error Tolerance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21570)
*Joni Shaska,Urbashi Mitra*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Neyman-Pearson因果发现的新框架，用于非对称错误控制的因果发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现算法未区分不同类型的边错误，且缺乏有限样本保证，该框架旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用信息论技术，基于Rényi散度确定性能极限，并针对线性加性高斯噪声模型提出epsilon-CUT算法。

Result: epsilon-CUT算法在控制假阳性率的同时，性能与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: 该框架为因果发现提供了非对称错误控制的解决方案，并展示了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for causal discovery with asymmetric
error control, called Neyman-Pearson causal discovery. Despite the importance
of applications where different types of edge errors may have different
importance, current state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms do not
differentiate between the types of edge errors, nor provide any finite-sample
guarantees on the edge errors. Hence, this framework seeks to minimize one type
of error while keeping the other below a user-specified tolerance level. Using
techniques from information theory, fundamental performance limits are found,
characterized by the R\'enyi divergence, for Neyman-Pearson causal discovery.
Furthermore, a causal discovery algorithm is introduced for the case of linear
additive Gaussian noise models, called epsilon-CUT, that provides finite-sample
guarantees on the false positive rate, while staying competitive with
state-of-the-art methods.

### [6] [Affine Invariant Semi-Blind Receiver: Joint Channel Estimation and High-Order Signal Detection for Multiuser Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21593)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型半盲联合信道估计与信号检测（JCESD）方法，用于解决大规模MIMO-OFDM系统中的用户间干扰和导频开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 仿真结果显示，在多用户场景下，该方法比广泛使用的基于导频的方法平均吞吐量提升11%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了频谱效率，适用于未来无线网络的高密度用户场景。

Abstract: Massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are foundational for downlink multi-user
(MU) communication in future wireless networks, for their ability to enhance
spectral efficiency and support a large number of users simultaneously.
However, high user density intensifies severe inter-user interference (IUI) and
pilot overhead. Consequently, existing blind and semi-blind channel estimation
(CE) and signal detection (SD) algorithms suffer performance degradation and
increased complexity, especially when further challenged by frequency-selective
channels and high-order modulation demands. To this end, this paper proposes a
novel semi-blind joint channel estimation and signal detection (JCESD) method.
Specifically, the proposed approach employs a hybrid precoding architecture to
suppress IUI. Furthermore we formulate JCESD as a non-convex constellation
fitting optimization exploiting constellation affine invariance. Few pilots are
used to achieve coarse estimation for initialization and ambiguity resolution.
For high-order modulations, a data augmentation mechanism utilizes the symmetry
of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations to increase the
effective number of samples. To address frequency-selective channels, CE
accuracy is then enhanced via an iterative refinement strategy that leverages
improved SD results. Simulation results demonstrate an average throughput gain
of 11\% over widely used pilot-based methods in MU scenarios, highlighting the
proposed method's potential to improve spectral efficiency.

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO is a key 6G technology, offering superior spectral and
energy efficiency. However, its dense deployment of low-cost access points
(APs) makes hardware impairments unavoidable. While narrowband impairments are
well-studied, their impact in wideband systems remains unexplored. This paper
provides the first comprehensive analysis of hardware impairments, such as
nonlinear distortion in low-noise amplifiers, phase noise, in-phase-quadrature
imbalance, and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, on uplink spectral
efficiency in cell-free massive MIMO. Using an OFDM waveform and centralized
processing, APs share channel state information for joint uplink combining.
Leveraging Bussgang decomposition, we derive a distortion-aware combining
vector that optimizes spectral efficiency by modeling distortion as independent
colored noise.

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a key enabler for
the sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks, offering significant spectral and
energy efficiency gains through user-centric operation of distributed access
points (APs). However, its reliance on low-cost APs introduces inevitable
hardware impairments, whose combined impact on wideband downlink systems
remains unexplored when analyzed using behavioral models. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) in cell-free
massive MIMO-OFDM systems under practical hardware impairments, including phase
noise and third-order power amplifier nonlinearities. Both centralized and
distributed precoding strategies are examined. By leveraging the Bussgang
decomposition, we derive an SE expression and quantify the relative impact of
impairments through simulations. Our results reveal that phase noise causes
more severe degradation than power amplifier distortions, especially in
distributed operation, highlighting the need for future distortion-aware
precoding designs.

Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implemented in
virtualized cloud radio access networks (V-CRAN) has emerged as a promising
architecture to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), network flexibility, and
energy efficiency (EE) in next-generation wireless systems. In this work, we
develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of

Specifically, we formulate a set of mixed-integer programming (MIP) models to
jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association,
cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum
total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios
based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical
results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power
consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces
TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in
cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless
network implementations.

effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework
for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.

orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward
compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also
offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable
physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all,
this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了一种双基地集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统，通过联合优化波束成形设计，实现通信与感知的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在双基地ISAC系统中，如何通过优化波束成形设计，同时满足通信用户的信息传输需求和感知接收器的目标方向估计需求。

Method: 推导了方向估计的Cramér-Rao界（CRB），并提出实际估计器；通过凸优化或SCA方法设计波束成形。

Result: 仅使用高斯信息信号会导致感知性能下降；联合设计显著优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 提出的波束成形设计在ISAC系统中实现了通信与感知的优异性能边界。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a bistatic integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) system, consisting of a multi-antenna base station (BS),
a multi-antenna sensing receiver, a single-antenna communication user (CU), and
a point target to be sensed. Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of
Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver
information symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the
target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by
processing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the
sequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the
information signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of
the information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive
the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose
practical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we
formulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to
minimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS.
When the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting
beamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an
optimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic
sensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a
locally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex
approximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing
Gaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for
target sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior
ISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes.

Conclusion: 近场RSMA-RIS集成在隐蔽通信中具有显著潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper explores the near field (NF) covert communication with the aid of
rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RIS). In particular, the RIS operates in the NF of both the legitimate user
and the passive adversary, enhancing the legitimate users received signal while
suppressing the adversarys detection capability. Whereas, the base station (BS)
applies RSMA to increase the covert communication rate composed of a private
and a shared rate component. To characterize system covertness, we derive
closed form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP), outage
probability (OP), and optimal detection threshold for the adversary. We
formulate a non-convex joint beamforming optimization problem at the BS and RIS
under unit-modulus constraints to maximize the covert rate. To tackle this, we
propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, where the BS beamformer is
designed using a two-stage iterative method based on successive convex
approximation (SCA). Additionally, two low-complexity techniques are introduced
to further reduce the adversarys received power. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the covert communication rate,
highlighting the potential of near field RSMA-RIS integration in covert
communication.

Conclusion: Zak-OTFS方案在标准化Veh-A信道中表现出鲁棒性和可扩展性，适用于未来mMTC部署。

Abstract: This paper proposes a grant-free coded random access (CRA) scheme for uplink
massive machine-type communications (mMTC), based on Zak-orthogonal time
frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation in the delay-Doppler domain. The scheme
is tailored for doubly selective wireless channels, where conventional
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CRA suffers from
unreliable inter-slot channel prediction due to time-frequency variability. By
exploiting the predictable nature of Zak-OTFS, the proposed approach enables
accurate channel estimation across slots, facilitating reliable successive
interference cancellation across user packet replicas. A fair comparison with
an OFDM-based CRA baseline shows that the proposed scheme achieves
significantly lower packet loss rates under high mobility and user density.
Extensive simulations over the standardized Veh-A channel confirm the
robustness and scalability of Zak-OTFS-based CRA, supporting its applicability
to future mMTC deployments.

*Mingjun Ying,Dipankar Shakya,Peijie Ma,Guanyue Qian,Theodore S. Rappaport*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种位置校准算法，用于提高NYURay射线追踪模拟器的准确性，通过优化发射-接收位置以减少GPS误差，显著提升了LOS和NLOS场景的定位精度。验证结果显示，NYURay在路径损耗预测方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 射线追踪模拟器的准确性受限于测量数据不足和缺乏系统验证，因此需要一种方法来校准和验证模拟器的性能。

Method: 提出了一种位置校准算法，通过优化发射-接收位置以对齐模拟和测量的功率延迟分布，从而减少GPS误差。

Result: 校准后，LOS和NLOS场景的定位精度分别提高了42.3%和13.5%。路径损耗预测的偏差小于0.14，但延迟和角度扩展的预测略有低估。

Conclusion: 验证后的NYURay为6G部署提供了可靠的无线信道统计，并推动了射线追踪验证的进展。

Abstract: Ray-tracing (RT) simulators are essential for wireless digital twins,
enabling accurate site-specific radio channel prediction for next-generation
wireless systems. Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient
measurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents
site-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray
tracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a
location calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by
optimizing transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations to align simulated and
measured power delay profiles, improving TX-RX location accuracy by 42.3% for
line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.
Validation across 18 TX-RX locations shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss
prediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14. While RT
underestimates delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions
remain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and
provides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment.

*Teng,Ma,Sile Yin,Li-Chia Yang,Shuo Zhang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: RAVEN是一个实时音视频语音增强系统，通过结合音频和视觉信息，有效增强目标说话人声音并抑制干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决音频环境中干扰说话人和背景噪声对语音增强的挑战。

Method: 结合音频-视觉语音识别（AVSR）和主动说话人检测（ASD）的视觉嵌入，开发实时流式系统。

Result: AVSR和ASD嵌入结合在低信噪比多说话人环境中效果最佳，AVSR嵌入在纯噪声场景中表现最好。

Conclusion: RAVEN是首个开源的实时AVSE系统，展示了音视频结合在语音增强中的潜力。

Abstract: Speech enhancement in audio-only settings remains challenging, particularly
in the presence of interfering speakers. This paper presents a simple yet
effective real-time audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system, RAVEN, which
isolates and enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing
interfering speakers and background noise. We investigate how visual embeddings
learned from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker
detection (ASD) contribute to AVSE across different SNR conditions and numbers
of interfering speakers. Our results show concatenating embeddings from AVSR
and ASD models provides the greatest improvement in low-SNR, multi-speaker
environments, while AVSR embeddings alone perform best in noise-only scenarios.
In addition, we develop a real-time streaming system that operates on a
computer CPU and we provide a video demonstration and code repository. To our
knowledge, this is the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE
system.

*Cameron Churchwell,Minje Kim,Paris Smaragdis*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“combolutional layer”的新层结构，用于音频任务中的谐波特征提取，替代传统卷积层，具有低参数、高效CPU推理等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在音频任务中，短片段可能包含数百万样本，选择合适的归纳偏置对机器学习模型设计至关重要。

Method: 提出combolutional层，结合学习延迟IIR梳状滤波器和融合包络检测器，在时域提取谐波特征。

Result: 在钢琴转录、说话人分类和音调检测等任务中表现优异，计算成本低且实现高效。

Conclusion: combolutional层在需要精确谐波分析的音频任务中是卷积层的有效替代，具有参数少、计算高效和可解释性强等优势。

Abstract: Selecting appropriate inductive biases is an essential step in the design of
machine learning models, especially when working with audio, where even short
clips may contain millions of samples. To this end, we propose the
combolutional layer: a learned-delay IIR comb filter and fused envelope
detector, which extracts harmonic features in the time domain. We demonstrate
the efficacy of the combolutional layer on three information retrieval tasks,
evaluate its computational cost relative to other audio frontends, and provide
efficient implementations for training. We find that the combolutional layer is
an effective replacement for convolutional layers in audio tasks where precise
harmonic analysis is important, e.g., piano transcription, speaker
classification, and key detection. Additionally, the combolutional layer has
several other key benefits over existing frontends, namely: low parameter
count, efficient CPU inference, strictly real-valued computations, and improved
interpretability.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了主观语音评估与客观声学测量在头颈癌患者中的关联，发现主观可懂度、发音和音质与客观测量高度相关，提示单一可懂度测量可能足以用于临床监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床语音学和治疗监测需要有效的语音评估方法，研究旨在验证主观评估与客观测量的关联性。

Method: 通过训练有素的听评员对头颈癌患者的语音进行主观评分，并与客观声学测量数据对比分析。

Result: 主观可懂度、发音和音质与客观测量高度相关，且可懂度与语速的客观测量与主观评分一致。

Conclusion: 单一可懂度测量可能足以用于头颈癌患者的临床监测，简化评估流程。

Abstract: Meaningful speech assessment is vital in clinical phonetics and therapy
monitoring. This study examined the link between perceptual speech assessments
and objective acoustic measures in a large head and neck cancer (HNC) dataset.
Trained listeners provided ratings of intelligibility, articulation, voice
quality, phonation, speech rate, nasality, and background noise on speech.
Strong correlations were found between subjective intelligibility,
articulation, and voice quality, likely due to a shared underlying cause of
speech symptoms in our speaker population. Objective measures of
intelligibility and speech rate aligned with their subjective counterpart. Our
results suggest that a single intelligibility measure may be sufficient for the
clinical monitoring of speakers treated for HNC using concomitant
chemoradiation.

Abstract: As speech generation technology advances, the risk of misuse through deepfake
audio has become a pressing concern, which underscores the critical need for
robust detection systems. However, many existing speech deepfake datasets are
limited in scale and diversity, making it challenging to train models that can
generalize well to unseen deepfakes. To address these gaps, we introduce
SpeechFake, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for speech deepfake
detection. SpeechFake includes over 3 million deepfake samples, totaling more
than 3,000 hours of audio, generated using 40 different speech synthesis tools.
The dataset encompasses a wide range of generation techniques, including
text-to-speech, voice conversion, and neural vocoder, incorporating the latest
cutting-edge methods. It also provides multilingual support, spanning 46
languages. In this paper, we offer a detailed overview of the dataset's
creation, composition, and statistics. We also present baseline results by
training detection models on SpeechFake, demonstrating strong performance on
both its own test sets and various unseen test sets. Additionally, we conduct
experiments to rigorously explore how generation methods, language diversity,
and speaker variation affect detection performance. We believe SpeechFake will
be a valuable resource for advancing speech deepfake detection and developing
more robust models for evolving generation techniques.

TL;DR: Whilter模型是一种多任务解决方案，用于识别大规模语音数据集中的不良样本，如多说话者、非目标语言和音乐。它基于Whisper编码器和注意力分类器，在五个分类任务中表现优异，F1分数超过85%，处理时间显著减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语音数据集中存在不良特征（如多说话者、非目标语言和音乐），可能影响模型学习，因此需要一种高效的多任务解决方案。

Method: Whilter模型结合Whisper编码器和注意力分类器，同时解决五个分类问题，并发布了一个标注数据集。

Result: Whilter在三个子任务中F1分数超过85%，错误率6.5%-7.8%，优于BEATs分类器，且处理时间更短。

Conclusion: Whilter是一种高效的多任务模型，适用于识别语音数据集中的不良样本，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large-scale in-the-wild speech datasets have become more prevalent in recent
years due to increased interest in models that can learn useful features from
unlabelled data for tasks such as speech recognition or synthesis. These
datasets often contain undesirable features, such as multiple speakers,
non-target languages, and music, which may impact model learning. The Whilter
model is proposed as a multitask solution to identify these undesirable
samples. Whilter uses a Whisper encoder with an attention-based classifier to
solve five diverse classification problems at once. In addition, an annotated
dataset is published for a subset of two popular in-the-wild corpora. Whilter
achieves F1 scores above 85% and equal error rates of 6.5% to 7.8% for three of
five subtasks, outperforming a state-of-the-art BEATs classifier on
speech-specific classes, with a notable decrease in processing time compared to
a combination of single-task alternatives.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经网络的方法，用于从湿信号中联合估计音频效果（AFX）类型及其顺序，利用双曲空间高效建模AFX链的树状结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频效果链的顺序对最终声音有重要影响，但现有研究主要关注效果类型和参数的估计，忽略了顺序问题。

Method: 提出了一种神经网络方法，将湿信号嵌入双曲空间并分类其AFX链，利用双曲空间的指数扩展特性高效表示树状结构。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在吉他声音上表现优于欧几里得空间方法，尤其在捕捉AFX顺序方面效果显著。

Conclusion: 双曲空间能有效建模AFX链的非交换性和指数增长特性，为音频效果链识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audio effects (AFXs) are essential tools in music production, frequently
applied in chains to shape timbre and dynamics. The order of AFXs in a chain
plays a crucial role in determining the final sound, particularly when
non-linear (e.g., distortion) or time-variant (e.g., chorus) processors are
involved. Despite its importance, most AFX-related studies have primarily
focused on estimating effect types and their parameters from a wet signal. To
address this gap, we formulate AFX chain recognition as the task of jointly
estimating AFX types and their order from a wet signal. We propose a
neural-network-based method that embeds wet signals into a hyperbolic space and
classifies their AFX chains. Hyperbolic space can represent tree-structured
data more efficiently than Euclidean space due to its exponential expansion
property. Since AFX chains can be represented as trees, with AFXs as nodes and
edges encoding effect order, hyperbolic space is well-suited for modeling the
exponentially growing and non-commutative nature of ordered AFX combinations,
where changes in effect order can result in different final sounds. Experiments
using guitar sounds demonstrate that, with an appropriate curvature, the
proposed method outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Further analysis based
on AFX type and chain length highlights the effectiveness of the proposed
method in capturing AFX order.

*Bin Deng,Jiatong Bai,Feilong Zhao,Zuming Xie,Maolin Li,Yan Wang,Feng Shu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段感知框架，用于解决异构混合模拟-数字H2AD MIMO架构中多发射源数量和方向估计的难题，包括三种目标数量感知方法和一种低复杂度高精度的DOA估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模全数字MIMO架构面临的高能耗、高电路成本和高复杂度问题，同时填补H2AD MIMO在多发射源智能感知方面的空白。

Method: 提出两阶段感知框架：1）设计三种目标数量感知方法（改进的EDC框架、基于统计特征的增强DNN、利用全特征值的改进1D-CNN）；2）引入OMC-DOA方法进行低复杂度高精度DOA估计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，三种方法在中高信噪比下实现100%目标数量感知，改进1D-CNN在极低信噪比下表现优异；OMC-DOA在多源环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了H2AD MIMO的多发射源感知问题，为未来无线网络提供了高效且低复杂度的解决方案。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

### [3] [Neural Energy Landscapes Predict Working Memory Decline After Brain Tumor Resection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23057)
*Triet M. Tran,Sina Khanmohammadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探讨脑肿瘤术前高阶神经动力学变化与术后工作记忆衰退的关系，通过fMRI和机器学习预测术后认知风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤手术可能导致术后认知功能障碍，研究旨在通过术前神经动力学特征预测术后工作记忆衰退。

Method: 分析术前fMRI数据，提取高阶脑交互能量景观，结合统计和随机森林模型预测术后工作记忆表现。

Result: 术后工作记忆较低的患者能量转换更极端且少，而较高者转换更频繁且温和；模型预测准确率达90%。

Conclusion: 术前高阶神经动力学特征可预测术后工作记忆衰退，为个性化手术规划和干预提供依据。

Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

Conclusion: BS-1-to-N方法通过环境感知和生成模型，为跨基站CKM推理提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) inference across base stations (BSs) is the key
to achieving efficient environmentaware communications. This paper proposes an
environmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the
generative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location
embedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS
location information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the
cross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to
respectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as
that among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target
BSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM
inference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.
Specifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free
networks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM
construction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N
model is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any
potential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by
exploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same
wireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to
multi-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same
wireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit
correlation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the
proposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs. We
provide extensive comparisons of CKM inference between the proposed BS-1-to-N
generative model versus benchmarking schemes, and provide one use case study to
demonstrate its practical application for the optimization of BS deployment.

### [6] [A Secure Full-Duplex Wireless Circulator enabled by Non-Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal RIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23381)
*Ziang Liu,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种非互易性超对角可重构智能表面（NR-BD-RIS）在全双工无线循环器中的应用，通过打破电路互易性实现安全传输，并优化了多用户总和速率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的对角可重构智能表面（D-RIS）在非对齐收发器通信中存在局限性，NR-BD-RIS通过非互易性设计提升性能，尤其适用于安全传输场景。

Method: 提出了一种基于NR-BD-RIS的全双工无线循环器系统，结合物理兼容的系统模型，采用块坐标下降（BCD）和惩罚对偶分解（PDD）算法优化总和速率。

Result: 数值评估表明，NR-BD-RIS在总和速率上优于互易性BD-RIS和传统D-RIS，尤其在支持多方向入射和反射时表现更佳，并能实现安全传输。

Conclusion: NR-BD-RIS在提升通信性能和安全性方面具有显著优势，为未来无线通信系统提供了新的技术方向。

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a
promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling
flexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the
interconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave
reconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at
one port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local
control of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further
enhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,
channel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among
non-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of
NR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices
communicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure
transmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses
signal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a
physics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural
scattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,
the advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate
an all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization
algorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual
decomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS
consistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal
(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two
impinging and reflection directions need to be supported. By analyzing the
power of signals from all other users and the beampatterns, we show that secure
transmission can be achieved.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于FPGA的硬件EVM（EVMx），用于加速智能合约执行，相比CPU环境性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EVM性能受限于通用计算机的约束，限制了智能合约的执行效率。

Method: 通过设计FPGA硬件架构（EVMx），利用其并行性和高速处理能力来执行智能合约。

Result: EVMx将常见操作码的执行时间减少了61%至99%，区块执行速度比文献中的类似工作快6倍。

Conclusion: 硬件加速的EVMx架构有望显著提升智能合约执行效率，推动EVM兼容区块链的性能提升。

Abstract: Ethereum blockchain uses smart contracts (SCs) to implement decentralized
applications (dApps). SCs are executed by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)
running within an Ethereum client. Moreover, the EVM has been widely adopted by
other blockchain platforms, including Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and
more. However, the EVM performance is limited by the constraints of the
general-purpose computer it operates on. This work proposes offloading SC
execution onto a dedicated hardware-based EVM. Specifically, EVMx is an
FPGA-based SC execution engine that benefits from the inherent parallelism and
high-speed processing capabilities of a hardware architecture. Synthesis
results demonstrate a reduction in execution time of 61% to 99% for commonly
used operation codes compared to CPU-based SC execution environments. Moreover,
the execution time of Ethereum blocks on EVMx is up to 6x faster compared to
analogous works in the literature. These results highlight the potential of the
proposed architecture to accelerate SC execution and enhance the performance of
EVM-compatible blockchains.

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are expected to adopt extremely
large aperture arrays (ELAAs), novel antenna architectures, and operate in
extremely high-frequency bands to meet growing data demands. ELAAs
significantly increase the number of antennas, enabling finer spatial
resolution and improved beamforming. At high frequencies, ELAAs shift
communication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where
spherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle
and distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel
estimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field
scenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel
estimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an
electromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences,
alongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream
near-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major
estimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations
(single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and
RIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among
estimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide
insights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel
estimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research
directions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GFRFT对所有图频率使用单一分数阶，限制了其适应不同信号特性的能力。

Method: 提出两种MPGFRFT，建立理论框架，设计光谱压缩策略，并引入可学习阶向量方案。

Result: 实验验证了MPGFRFT在图像加密、去噪等任务中的优越性能。

Conclusion: MPGFRFT框架在多任务中表现出灵活性和高性能。

Abstract: The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) applies a single global
fractional order to all graph frequencies, which restricts its adaptability to
diverse signal characteristics across the spectral domain. To address this
limitation, in this paper, we propose two types of multiple-parameter GFRFTs
(MPGFRFTs) and establish their corresponding theoretical frameworks. We design
a spectral compression strategy tailored for ultra-low compression ratios,
effectively preserving essential information even under extreme dimensionality
reduction. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a learnable order vector scheme
that enables adaptive compression and denoising, demonstrating strong
performance on both graph signals and images. We explore the application of
MPGFRFTs to image encryption and decryption. Experimental results validate the
versatility and superior performance of the proposed MPGFRFT framework across
various graph signal processing tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless
networks, with a focus on the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) and
achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into
interference patterns of modern network architectures, such as cell-less and
extremely large MIMO networks, and it generalizes existing characterizations of
the weak Pareto boundary. A central contribution is the derivation of
sufficient conditions that guarantee convexity of the utility regions.
Convexity is an important property because it ensures that time sharing (or
user grouping) cannot simultaneously increase the utility of all users when the
network operates on the weak Pareto boundary. These sufficient conditions also
have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate
maximization problems that are inherently convex without any variable
transformations, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably
optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide a rigorous justification
for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable
rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an
alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO
literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the
beamforming strategy.

Abstract: Real-time transmission of high-resolution video signals in an uncompressed
and unencrypted format requires an ultra-reliable and low-latency
communications (URLLC) medium with high bandwidth to maintain the quality of
experience (QoE) for users. We put forward the design and experimental
demonstration of a high-performance laser-based optical wireless communication
(OWC) system that enables high-definition (HD) video transmission with
submillisecond latencies. The serial digital interface (SDI) output of a camera
is used to transmit the live video stream over an optical wireless link by
directly modulating the SDI signal on the intensity of a 940 nm vertical cavity
surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The proposed SDI over light fidelity (LiFi)
system corroborates error-free transmission of full HD (FHD) and 4K
ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions at data rates of 2.97 Gb/s and 5.94
Gb/s, respectively, with a measured end-to-end latency of under 35 ns. Since
SDI standards support various video formats and VCSELs are high-bandwidth and
low-power devices, this presents a scalable and inexpensive solution for
wireless connectivity between professional broadcast equipment using
off-the-shelf SDI components.

Method: 使用SSCF极坐标参数描述语音动态特性，并结合MFCC；SSCF0作为伪特征描述基频。

Result: 提出的参数显著降低了词错误率，且比基线MFCC更具性别独立性。

Conclusion: SSCF极坐标参数与MFCC结合能有效提升ASR性能，尤其在越南语中表现优异。

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed
parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender
independence than the baseline MFCCs.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Full-Duplex-Bench v1.5是一个模块化、自动化的基准测试工具，用于评估全双工语音代理在四种重叠场景下的表现，揭示了两种主要策略，并支持定制化扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全双工语音代理在重叠管理方面缺乏系统评估，需要一种全面且可扩展的基准测试工具。

Method: 开发了Full-Duplex-Bench v1.5，模拟四种重叠场景，支持开源和商业模型，提供多种评估指标。

Conclusion: 该工具支持定制化扩展，有助于加速全双工语音系统的评估与优化。

Abstract: While full-duplex speech agents promise natural, low-latency human--machine
interaction by concurrently processing input and output speech, overlap
management remains under-evaluated. We introduce Full-Duplex-Bench v1.5, a
modular, fully automated benchmark that simulates four overlap scenarios: user
interruption, listener backchannel, side conversation, and ambient speech. Our
framework supports both open-sourced and commercial models, offering a
comprehensive, extensible metric suite -- categorical dialogue behaviors, stop
and response latency, prosodic adaptation, and perceived speech quality -- that
can be tailored to application-specific criteria. Benchmarking five
state-of-the-art agents reveals two principal strategies: repair-first rapid
yielding versus continuity-first sustained flow, and highlights
scenario-dependent performance trends. The open-sourced design enables seamless
extension with new audio assets, languages, and deployment contexts, empowering
practitioners to customize and accelerate the evaluation of robust full-duplex
speech systems.

Method: 引入FiDo方法，计算频谱和时间域声学特征及Whisper潜在表示的特征重要性，并基于权重投影特征到新空间，最后进行特征拼接。

Result: FiDo使MBI-Net+模型的RMSE降低了7.62%，并在2023年Clarity Prediction Challenge中表现优于最佳系统。

Conclusion: FiDo有效提升了助听器中神经语音评估的性能。

Abstract: Given the critical role of non-intrusive speech intelligibility assessment in
hearing aids (HA), this paper enhances its performance by introducing Feature
Importance across Domains (FiDo). We estimate feature importance on spectral
and time-domain acoustic features as well as latent representations of Whisper.
Importance weights are calculated per frame, and based on these weights,
features are projected into new spaces, allowing the model to focus on
important areas early. Next, feature concatenation is performed to combine the
features before the assessment module processes them. Experimental results show
that when FiDo is incorporated into the improved multi-branched speech
intelligibility model MBI-Net+, RMSE can be reduced by 7.62% (from 26.10 to
24.11). MBI-Net+ with FiDo also achieves a relative RMSE reduction of 3.98%
compared to the best system in the 2023 Clarity Prediction Challenge. These
results validate FiDo's effectiveness in enhancing neural speech assessment in

Abstract: This paper presents the Voice Timbre Attribute Detection (vTAD) systems
developed by the Digital Signal Processing & Speech Technology Laboratory
(DSP&STL) of the Department of Electronic Engineering (EE) at The Chinese
University of Hong Kong (CUHK) for the 20th National Conference on
Human-Computer Speech Communication (NCMMSC 2025) vTAD Challenge. The proposed
systems leverage WavLM-Large embeddings with attentive statistical pooling to
extract robust speaker representations, followed by two variants of Diff-Net,
i.e., Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation-enhanced
Residual FFN (SE-ResFFN), to compare timbre attribute intensities between
utterance pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that the WavLM-Large+FFN
system generalises better to unseen speakers, achieving 77.96% accuracy and
21.79% EER, while the WavLM-Large+SE-ResFFN model excels in the 'Seen' setting
with 94.42% accuracy and 5.49% EER. These findings highlight a trade-off
between model complexity and generalisation, and underscore the importance of
architectural choices in fine-grained speaker modelling. Our analysis also
reveals the impact of speaker identity, annotation subjectivity, and data
imbalance on system performance, pointing to future directions for improving
robustness and fairness in timbre attribute detection.

### [17] [MECAT: A Multi-Experts Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23511)
*Yadong Niu,Tianzi Wang,Heinrich Dinkel,Xingwei Sun,Jiahao Zhou,Gang Li,Jizhong Liu,Xunying Liu,Junbo Zhang,Jian Luan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MECAT基准和DATE评估指标，用于改进细粒度音频理解任务，弥补现有模型的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频语言模型在细粒度理解上仍落后于人类水平，主要因为当前基准的数据标注和评估指标无法区分通用和详细输出。

Method: 通过结合专家模型分析和大型语言模型的链式推理，构建MECAT基准，并引入DATE评估指标。

Result: MECAT提供了多视角细粒度标注和开放集问答对，DATE指标能有效奖励详细描述。

Conclusion: MECAT和DATE为音频理解任务提供了更可靠的评估工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio
understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This
gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations
and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly
detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert
Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via
a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with
Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides
multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs.
The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced
Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards
detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with
cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current
capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at

### [18] [Balancing Information Preservation and Disentanglement in Self-Supervised Music Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22995)
*Julia Wilkins,Sivan Ding,Magdalena Fuentes,Juan Pablo Bello*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对比和重建目标的多视图自监督学习框架，用于音乐音频表示的分离，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在音乐音频表示中各有侧重，但缺乏对对比和重建范式交互的研究。

Method: 设计了一个多视图自监督学习框架，结合对比和重建目标，以分离音乐音频表示。

Result: 实验表明，对比和重建策略在结合时能互补，实现音乐属性的分离且不损失信息完整性。

Conclusion: 多视图框架有效结合了对比和重建目标，为音乐音频表示分离提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) methods offer a range of
strategies for capturing useful representations from music audio without the
need for labeled data. While some techniques focus on preserving comprehensive
details through reconstruction, others favor semantic structure via contrastive
objectives. Few works examine the interaction between these paradigms in a
unified SSL framework. In this work, we propose a multi-view SSL framework for
disentangling music audio representations that combines contrastive and
reconstructive objectives. The architecture is designed to promote both
information fidelity and structured semantics of factors in disentangled
subspaces. We perform an extensive evaluation on the design choices of
contrastive strategies using music audio representations in a controlled
setting. We find that while reconstruction and contrastive strategies exhibit
consistent trade-offs, when combined effectively, they complement each other;
this enables the disentanglement of music attributes without compromising
information integrity.

*Bob L. T. Sturm*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 作者通过两张AI生成音乐专辑探索了AI音乐创作的边界、作者身份问题及自我反思。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI音乐生成平台的局限性及其对创作者身份和音乐风格的影响。

Method: 使用AI音乐生成平台创作两张专辑，并通过LLM进行自我访谈。

Result: 揭示了AI音乐生成的局限性，并引发对作者身份和创作过程的深入思考。

Conclusion: AI音乐生成工具改变了创作方式，但也提出了关于作者身份和创作真实性的新问题。

Abstract: I reflect on my experience creating two music albums centered on
state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms. The first album
explicitly poses the question: What happens when I collide my junk mail with
these platforms? The second album is a direct response to the first, and toys
with the inability of state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation
platforms to generate music that is not ``practiced'', ``polished'', and
``produced''. I seed a large language model (LLM) with information about these
albums and have it interview me, which results in the exploration of several
deeper questions: To what extent am I the author? Where am I in the resulting
music? How is my musical identity changing as I am faced with machines that are
in some ways far more talented than I? What new musical spaces does my work
open, for me or anyone/thing else? I conclude by reflecting on my reflections,
as well as LLM-mediated self-reflection as method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别听力困难时刻对助听技术至关重要，需要实时干预。

Method: 比较了音频语言模型、ASR热词启发式方法和Wav2Vec微调方法。

Result: 音频语言模型显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 音频语言模型在检测听力困难时刻任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Individuals regularly experience Hearing Difficulty Moments in everyday
conversation. Identifying these moments of hearing difficulty has particular
significance in the field of hearing assistive technology where timely
interventions are key for realtime hearing assistance. In this paper, we
propose and compare machine learning solutions for continuously detecting
utterances that identify these specific moments in conversational audio. We
show that audio language models, through their multimodal reasoning
capabilities, excel at this task, significantly outperforming a simple ASR
hotword heuristic and a more conventional fine-tuning approach with Wav2Vec, an
audio-only input architecture that is state-of-the-art for automatic speech
recognition (ASR).

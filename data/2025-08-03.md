Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段感知框架，用于异构混合模拟-数字H2AD MIMO架构中多发射源的数量和方向估计，解决了高能耗、高电路成本和高复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构混合模拟-数字H2AD MIMO架构中多发射源数量和方向感知的难题，以替代传统大规模全数字MIMO。

Method: 设计了三种目标数量感知方法（改进的EDC框架、基于统计特征的增强DNN、利用全特征值的改进1D-CNN）和一种低复杂度高精度的OMC-DOA方向估计方法。

Result: 三种方法在中高信噪比下实现100%目标数量感知，改进的1D-CNN在极低信噪比下表现优异；OMC-DOA在多源环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了H2AD MIMO的多源感知问题，为未来无线网络提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

### [3] [Neural Energy Landscapes Predict Working Memory Decline After Brain Tumor Resection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23057)
*Triet M. Tran,Sina Khanmohammadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探讨脑肿瘤术前高阶神经动力学变化与术后工作记忆衰退的关系，通过fMRI和机器学习模型预测术后认知风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤手术可能导致术后认知功能障碍，研究旨在通过术前神经动力学特征预测这种风险。

Method: 分析术前fMRI数据，提取高阶脑交互能量特征，结合统计和随机森林模型预测术后工作记忆表现。

Result: 术后工作记忆较低的患者能量转换更极端但较少，而较高分患者转换更频繁但温和。模型预测准确率达90%。

Conclusion: 术前高阶神经动力学特征可预测术后工作记忆衰退，为个性化手术规划和干预提供依据。

Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成扩散模型的环境感知跨基站CKM推断方法BS-1-to-N，通过BSLE嵌入基站位置信息，并利用交叉和自注意力机制学习基站间关系，实现高效推断。

Conclusion: BS-1-to-N方法通过环境感知和生成模型，显著提升了跨基站CKM推断的效率，为无线通信优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) inference across base stations (BSs) is the key
to achieving efficient environmentaware communications. This paper proposes an
environmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the
generative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location
embedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS
location information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the
cross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to
respectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as
that among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target
BSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM
inference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.
Specifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free
networks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM
construction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N
model is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any
potential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by
exploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same
wireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to
multi-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same
wireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit
correlation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the
proposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs. We
provide extensive comparisons of CKM inference between the proposed BS-1-to-N
generative model versus benchmarking schemes, and provide one use case study to
demonstrate its practical application for the optimization of BS deployment.

### [6] [A Secure Full-Duplex Wireless Circulator enabled by Non-Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal RIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23381)

Main category: eess.SP

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a
promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling
flexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the
interconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave
reconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at
one port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local
control of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further
enhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,
channel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among
non-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of
NR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices
communicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure
transmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses
signal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a
physics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural
scattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,
the advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate
an all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization
algorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual
decomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS
consistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal
(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two
impinging and reflection directions need to be supported. By analyzing the
power of signals from all other users and the beampatterns, we show that secure
transmission can be achieved.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于FPGA的硬件EVM（EVMx），用于加速智能合约执行，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EVM性能受限于通用计算机，限制了智能合约的执行效率。

Method: 通过设计FPGA硬件架构（EVMx），利用其并行性和高速处理能力加速智能合约执行。

Result: 实验显示，常用操作码执行时间减少61%至99%，区块执行速度比同类工作快6倍。

Conclusion: EVMx架构能显著提升智能合约执行效率，增强EVM兼容区块链的性能。

Abstract: Ethereum blockchain uses smart contracts (SCs) to implement decentralized
applications (dApps). SCs are executed by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)
running within an Ethereum client. Moreover, the EVM has been widely adopted by
other blockchain platforms, including Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and
more. However, the EVM performance is limited by the constraints of the
general-purpose computer it operates on. This work proposes offloading SC
execution onto a dedicated hardware-based EVM. Specifically, EVMx is an
FPGA-based SC execution engine that benefits from the inherent parallelism and
high-speed processing capabilities of a hardware architecture. Synthesis
results demonstrate a reduction in execution time of 61% to 99% for commonly
used operation codes compared to CPU-based SC execution environments. Moreover,
the execution time of Ethereum blocks on EVMx is up to 6x faster compared to
analogous works in the literature. These results highlight the potential of the
proposed architecture to accelerate SC execution and enhance the performance of
EVM-compatible blockchains.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文综述了6G系统中近场信道估计的最新进展，探讨了极大规模天线阵列（ELAAs）在高频段的应用及其带来的挑战，比较了近场与远场模型的差异，并总结了主流估计技术及其权衡。

Conclusion: 本文为6G系统中的近场信道估计提供了理论基础和技术方向，同时指出了关键挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are expected to adopt extremely
large aperture arrays (ELAAs), novel antenna architectures, and operate in
extremely high-frequency bands to meet growing data demands. ELAAs
significantly increase the number of antennas, enabling finer spatial
resolution and improved beamforming. At high frequencies, ELAAs shift
communication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where
spherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle
and distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel
estimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field
scenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel
estimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an
electromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences,
alongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream
near-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major
estimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations
(single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and
RIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among
estimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide
insights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel
estimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research
directions.

Motivation: 传统图分数傅里叶变换（GFRFT）对所有频率使用单一分数阶，限制了其适应不同信号特性的能力。

Method: 设计了两种MPGFRFT，提出超低压缩比下的谱压缩策略和可学习阶向量方案，支持自适应压缩和去噪。

Result: 实验验证了MPGFRFT在多种图信号处理任务中的灵活性和优越性能。

Conclusion: MPGFRFT框架在信号处理和图像加密中具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) applies a single global
fractional order to all graph frequencies, which restricts its adaptability to
diverse signal characteristics across the spectral domain. To address this
limitation, in this paper, we propose two types of multiple-parameter GFRFTs
(MPGFRFTs) and establish their corresponding theoretical frameworks. We design
a spectral compression strategy tailored for ultra-low compression ratios,
effectively preserving essential information even under extreme dimensionality
reduction. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a learnable order vector scheme
that enables adaptive compression and denoising, demonstrating strong
performance on both graph signals and images. We explore the application of
MPGFRFTs to image encryption and decryption. Experimental results validate the
versatility and superior performance of the proposed MPGFRFT framework across
various graph signal processing tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless
networks, with a focus on the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) and
achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into
interference patterns of modern network architectures, such as cell-less and
extremely large MIMO networks, and it generalizes existing characterizations of
the weak Pareto boundary. A central contribution is the derivation of
sufficient conditions that guarantee convexity of the utility regions.
Convexity is an important property because it ensures that time sharing (or
user grouping) cannot simultaneously increase the utility of all users when the
network operates on the weak Pareto boundary. These sufficient conditions also
have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate
maximization problems that are inherently convex without any variable
transformations, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably
optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide a rigorous justification
for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable
rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an
alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO
literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the
beamforming strategy.

Conclusion: 该系统利用现成的SDI组件，为专业广播设备之间的无线连接提供了一种可扩展且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time transmission of high-resolution video signals in an uncompressed
and unencrypted format requires an ultra-reliable and low-latency
communications (URLLC) medium with high bandwidth to maintain the quality of
experience (QoE) for users. We put forward the design and experimental
demonstration of a high-performance laser-based optical wireless communication
(OWC) system that enables high-definition (HD) video transmission with
submillisecond latencies. The serial digital interface (SDI) output of a camera
is used to transmit the live video stream over an optical wireless link by
directly modulating the SDI signal on the intensity of a 940 nm vertical cavity
surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The proposed SDI over light fidelity (LiFi)
system corroborates error-free transmission of full HD (FHD) and 4K
ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions at data rates of 2.97 Gb/s and 5.94
Gb/s, respectively, with a measured end-to-end latency of under 35 ns. Since
SDI standards support various video formats and VCSELs are high-bandwidth and
low-power devices, this presents a scalable and inexpensive solution for
wireless connectivity between professional broadcast equipment using
off-the-shelf SDI components.

Motivation: 语音信号的动态特性对ASR性能至关重要，但传统MFCC未能充分捕捉这些特性。

Method: 使用SSCF的极坐标参数表征语音动态特性，并结合MFCC，同时利用SSCF0作为伪特征描述基频。

Result: 提出的参数显著降低了词错误率，且比基线MFCC更具性别独立性。

Conclusion: 结合SSCF动态参数和MFCC的方法在越南语ASR中表现优越，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed
parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender
independence than the baseline MFCCs.

Conclusion: 开源设计使工具易于扩展，支持定制化评估，推动全双工语音系统的稳健发展。

Abstract: While full-duplex speech agents promise natural, low-latency human--machine
interaction by concurrently processing input and output speech, overlap
management remains under-evaluated. We introduce Full-Duplex-Bench v1.5, a
modular, fully automated benchmark that simulates four overlap scenarios: user
interruption, listener backchannel, side conversation, and ambient speech. Our
framework supports both open-sourced and commercial models, offering a
comprehensive, extensible metric suite -- categorical dialogue behaviors, stop
and response latency, prosodic adaptation, and perceived speech quality -- that
can be tailored to application-specific criteria. Benchmarking five
state-of-the-art agents reveals two principal strategies: repair-first rapid
yielding versus continuity-first sustained flow, and highlights
scenario-dependent performance trends. The open-sourced design enables seamless
extension with new audio assets, languages, and deployment contexts, empowering
practitioners to customize and accelerate the evaluation of robust full-duplex
speech systems.

Result: FiDo使MBI-Net+模型的RMSE降低了7.62%，并在2023年Clarity Prediction Challenge中表现优于最佳系统。

Conclusion: FiDo能有效提升助听器中神经语音评估的性能。

Abstract: Given the critical role of non-intrusive speech intelligibility assessment in
hearing aids (HA), this paper enhances its performance by introducing Feature
Importance across Domains (FiDo). We estimate feature importance on spectral

Importance weights are calculated per frame, and based on these weights,

important areas early. Next, feature concatenation is performed to combine the
features before the assessment module processes them. Experimental results show
that when FiDo is incorporated into the improved multi-branched speech
intelligibility model MBI-Net+, RMSE can be reduced by 7.62% (from 26.10 to
24.11). MBI-Net+ with FiDo also achieves a relative RMSE reduction of 3.98%
compared to the best system in the 2023 Clarity Prediction Challenge. These
results validate FiDo's effectiveness in enhancing neural speech assessment in
HA.

Abstract: This paper presents the Voice Timbre Attribute Detection (vTAD) systems
developed by the Digital Signal Processing & Speech Technology Laboratory
(DSP&STL) of the Department of Electronic Engineering (EE) at The Chinese
University of Hong Kong (CUHK) for the 20th National Conference on
Human-Computer Speech Communication (NCMMSC 2025) vTAD Challenge. The proposed
systems leverage WavLM-Large embeddings with attentive statistical pooling to
extract robust speaker representations, followed by two variants of Diff-Net,
i.e., Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation-enhanced
Residual FFN (SE-ResFFN), to compare timbre attribute intensities between
utterance pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that the WavLM-Large+FFN
system generalises better to unseen speakers, achieving 77.96% accuracy and
21.79% EER, while the WavLM-Large+SE-ResFFN model excels in the 'Seen' setting
with 94.42% accuracy and 5.49% EER. These findings highlight a trade-off
between model complexity and generalisation, and underscore the importance of
architectural choices in fine-grained speaker modelling. Our analysis also
reveals the impact of speaker identity, annotation subjectivity, and data
imbalance on system performance, pointing to future directions for improving
robustness and fairness in timbre attribute detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MECAT基准和DATE评估指标，用于提升音频理解的细粒度评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频-语言模型在细粒度理解上存在不足，现有基准和数据标注限制了评估的可靠性。

Method: 通过专家模型与Chain-of-Thought语言模型结合生成多视角细粒度标注，并设计DATE评估指标。

Result: MECAT提供了更细粒度的音频理解评估，DATE指标能区分通用与详细描述。

Conclusion: MECAT和DATE为音频理解模型提供了更可靠的评估工具，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio
understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This
gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations
and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly
detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert
Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via
a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with
Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides
multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs.
The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced
Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards
detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with
cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current
capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at

*Julia Wilkins,Sivan Ding,Magdalena Fuentes,Juan Pablo Bello*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合对比和重构目标的多视图自监督学习框架，用于解耦音乐音频表示，平衡信息保真度和结构化语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督学习中对比和重构目标的交互作用，以统一框架解耦音乐音频表示。

Method: 设计多视图自监督学习框架，结合对比和重构目标，评估对比策略的设计选择。

Result: 重构和对比策略存在权衡，但有效结合时能互补，实现音乐属性的解耦且不损失信息完整性。

Conclusion: 多视图自监督学习框架能有效解耦音乐音频表示，为自监督学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) methods offer a range of
strategies for capturing useful representations from music audio without the
need for labeled data. While some techniques focus on preserving comprehensive
details through reconstruction, others favor semantic structure via contrastive
objectives. Few works examine the interaction between these paradigms in a
unified SSL framework. In this work, we propose a multi-view SSL framework for
disentangling music audio representations that combines contrastive and
reconstructive objectives. The architecture is designed to promote both
information fidelity and structured semantics of factors in disentangled
subspaces. We perform an extensive evaluation on the design choices of
contrastive strategies using music audio representations in a controlled
setting. We find that while reconstruction and contrastive strategies exhibit
consistent trade-offs, when combined effectively, they complement each other;
this enables the disentanglement of music attributes without compromising
information integrity.

TL;DR: 作者通过两张基于AI音乐生成平台的专辑，探讨了AI音乐创作的作者身份、个人音乐身份的变化以及AI生成音乐的新空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI音乐生成平台对创作过程的影响，以及作者身份和音乐身份的重新定义。

Method: 使用AI音乐生成平台创作两张专辑，并通过大型语言模型（LLM）进行自我访谈，探讨相关问题。

Result: 揭示了AI音乐生成平台的局限性，同时提出了关于作者身份和音乐创作新空间的思考。

Conclusion: 通过LLM媒介的自我反思，作者进一步思考了AI在音乐创作中的角色及其对个人创作的影响。

Abstract: I reflect on my experience creating two music albums centered on
state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms. The first album
explicitly poses the question: What happens when I collide my junk mail with
these platforms? The second album is a direct response to the first, and toys
with the inability of state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation
platforms to generate music that is not ``practiced'', ``polished'', and
``produced''. I seed a large language model (LLM) with information about these
albums and have it interview me, which results in the exploration of several
deeper questions: To what extent am I the author? Where am I in the resulting
music? How is my musical identity changing as I am faced with machines that are
in some ways far more talented than I? What new musical spaces does my work
open, for me or anyone/thing else? I conclude by reflecting on my reflections,
as well as LLM-mediated self-reflection as method.

Abstract: Individuals regularly experience Hearing Difficulty Moments in everyday
conversation. Identifying these moments of hearing difficulty has particular
significance in the field of hearing assistive technology where timely
interventions are key for realtime hearing assistance. In this paper, we
propose and compare machine learning solutions for continuously detecting
utterances that identify these specific moments in conversational audio. We
show that audio language models, through their multimodal reasoning
capabilities, excel at this task, significantly outperforming a simple ASR
hotword heuristic and a more conventional fine-tuning approach with Wav2Vec, an
audio-only input architecture that is state-of-the-art for automatic speech
recognition (ASR).

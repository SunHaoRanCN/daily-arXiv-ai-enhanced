It is important for tasks such as\nspectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent\nyears, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC. However,\nmainstream methods still face two key problems. First, they often use\ntime-frequency images instead of raw signals. This causes loss of key\nmodulation features and reduces adaptability to different communication\nconditions. Second, most methods rely on supervised learning. This needs a\nlarge amount of labeled data, which is hard to get in real-world environments.\nTo solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called\nRIS-MAE. RIS-MAE uses masked autoencoders to learn signal features from\nunlabeled data. It takes raw IQ sequences as input. By applying random masking\nand reconstruction, it captures important time-domain features such as\namplitude, phase, etc. This helps the model learn useful and transferable\nrepresentations. RIS-MAE is tested on four datasets. The results show that it\nperforms better than existing methods in few-shot and cross-domain tasks.\nNotably, it achieves high classification accuracy on previously unseen datasets\nwith only a small number of fine-tuning samples, confirming its generalization\nability and potential for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6RIS-MAE\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u9891\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u539f\u59cbIQ\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\uff08AMC\uff09\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u9891\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u4e22\u5931\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRIS-MAE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u539f\u59cbIQ\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u5e45\u5ea6\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cRIS-MAE\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "RIS-MAE\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aAMC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In\nparticular, the dynamic working mode configuration for the RDARS-aided system\nbrings an extra selection gain compared to the existing reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (RIS)-aided system and distributed antenna system (DAS). In\nthis paper, we consider the RDARS-aided downlink multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) system and aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) by jointly\noptimizing the beamforming matrices at the based station (BS) and RDARS, as\nwell as mode switching matrix at RDARS.

To further escape the\nlocal optimum point in the PWM algorithm, a model-driven DL method is\nintegrated into this algorithm, where the key variables related to the\nconvergence of PWM algorithm are trained to accelerate the convergence speed\nand improve the system performance.

However, it can only handle limited types of noises, and\nthe performance degrades when the input noise exhibits non-uniform power\nspectral density. To address these limitations, this paper devises a novel\nselective fixed-filter scheme based on a delayless subband structure. In the\noff-line training stage, subband control filters are pre-trained for different\nfrequency ranges and stored in a dedicated sub-filter database. During the\non-line control stage, the incoming noise is decomposed using a polyphase FFT\nfilter bank, and a frequency-band-matching mechanism assigns each subband\nsignal the most appropriate control filter. Subsequently, a weight stacking\ntechnique is employed to combine all subband weights into a fullband filter,\nenabling real-time noise suppression. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed scheme provides fast convergence, effective noise reduction, and\nstrong robustness in handling more complicated noisy environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5b50\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u56fa\u5b9a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u975e\u5747\u5300\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u56fa\u5b9a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u7c7b\u578b\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b50\u5e26\u63a7\u5236\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5e76\u5b58\u50a8\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u63a7\u5236\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76f8FFT\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\u5206\u89e3\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u5e26\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u53e0\u52a0\u6280\u672f\u5408\u6210\u5168\u5e26\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3001\u6709\u6548\u964d\u566a\u548c\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

High throughput\nsatellite (HTS) systems, utilizing multipoint beam and frequency multiplexing\ntechniques, enable satellite communication capacity of up to Tbps to meet the\ngrowing traffic demand. Therefore, it is imperative to review\nthe-state-of-the-art of multibeam HTS systems and identify their associated\nchallenges and perspectives. Firstly, we summarize the multibeam HTS hardware\nfoundations, including ground station systems, on-board payloads, and user\nterminals. Subsequently, we review the flexible on-board radio resource\nallocation approaches of bandwidth, power, time slot, and joint allocation\nschemes of HTS systems to optimize resource utilization and cater to\nnon-uniform service demand. Additionally, we survey multibeam precoding methods\nfor the HTS system to achieve full-frequency reuse and interference\ncancellation, which are classified according to different deployments such as\nsingle gateway precoding, multiple gateway precoding, on-board precoding, and\nhybrid on-board/on-ground precoding. Finally, we disscuss the challenges\nrelated to Q/V band link outage, time and frequency synchronization of\ngateways, the accuracy of channel state information (CSI), payload light-weight\ndevelopment, and the application of deep learning (DL). Research on these\ntopics will contribute to enhancing the performance of HTS systems and finally\ndelivering high-speed data to areas underserved by terrestrial networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u591a\u6ce2\u675f\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u536b\u661f\uff08HTS\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u786c\u4ef6\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3001\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u662f6G\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u603b\u7ed3HTS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u53ca\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86HTS\u786c\u4ef6\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u591a\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86Q/V\u9891\u6bb5\u94fe\u8def\u4e2d\u65ad\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bfe\u9898\u5c06\u63d0\u5347HTS\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u5730\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u901f\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

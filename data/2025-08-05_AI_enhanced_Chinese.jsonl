However, mmWave signals suffer from their inherent characteristics\nsuch as severe path loss, poor scattering, and limited diffraction, which\nnecessitate the use of large antenna arrays and directional beamforming,\ntypically implemented through massive MIMO architectures. Accurate channel\nestimation is critical in such systems, but its computational complexity\nincreases proportionally with the number of antennas. This may become a\nsignificant burden in mmWave systems where channels exhibit rapid fluctuations\nand require frequent updates. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity\nchannel denoiser based on Bayesian binary hypothesis testing and beamspace\nsparsity. By modeling each sparse beamspace component as a mixture of signal\nand noise under a Bernoulli-complex Gaussian prior, we formulate a likelihood\nratio test to detect signal-relevant elements. Then, a hard-thresholding rule\nis applied to suppress noise-dominant components in the noisy channel vector.\nDespite its extremely low computational complexity, the proposed method\nachieves channel estimation accuracy that is comparable to that of complex\niterative or learning-based approaches. This effectiveness is supported by both\ntheoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, suggesting that the method can\nbe a viable option for mmWave systems with strict resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e8c\u5143\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fe1\u9053\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u5927\u3001\u6563\u5c04\u5dee\u548c\u884d\u5c04\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u4f46\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2f\u52aa\u5229-\u590d\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5efa\u6a21\u7a00\u758f\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u68c0\u9a8c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f8\u5173\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u786c\u9608\u503c\u89c4\u5219\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5206\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u8fed\u4ee3\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, most of the prior analysis tends to ignore\nthe interactive dispersion caused by the wideband property of ODDM signal,\nwhich possibly leads to performance degradation. To solve this problem, we\ninvestigate the input-output relation of ODDM systems considering the wideband\neffect, which is also known as the Doppler squint effect (DSE) in the\nliterature. The extra delay-Doppler (DD) dispersion caused by the DSE is first\nexplicitly explained by employing the time-variant frequency response of\nmultipath channels. Its characterization is then derived for both reduced\ncyclic prefix (RCP) and zero padded (ZP)-based wideband ODDM systems, where the\nextra DD spread and more complicated power leakage outside the peak region are\npresented theoretically.

The system exhibits robust performance under\npitch noise up to +/-50 cents, maintaining consistent accuracy across ragas\n(90.7-91.8%), thus preserving the cultural authenticity of Indian classical\nmusic expression.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShrutiSense\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u5370\u5ea6\u53e4\u5178\u97f3\u4e50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u97f3\u9ad8\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea0\u6b63\u897f\u65b9\u5316\u6216\u635f\u574f\u7684\u97f3\u9ad8\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u8865\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u97f3\u4e50\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u672a\u80fd\u8003\u8651\u5370\u5ea6\u53e4\u5178\u97f3\u4e50\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u97f3\u7a0b\uff0822 shrutis\uff09\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u7684raga\u8bed\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Shruti\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff08FST\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea6\u675f\u7684Shruti\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff08GC-SHMM\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cFST\u6a21\u578bshruti\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe91.3%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u97f3\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "ShrutiSense\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u5370\u5ea6\u53e4\u5178\u97f3\u4e50\u7684\u6587\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

From\nthe temporal perspective, HBMNet integrates multi-scale cues and bidirectional\nboundary-content relationships. Experiments show that encoding and fusion\nprimarily improve precision, while frame-level supervision boosts recall. Each\nmodule (audio-visual fusion, temporal scales, bi-directionality) contributes\ncomplementary benefits, collectively enhancing localization performance.

To further strengthen this alignment, recent\nworks have proposed Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple\naudio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby\npromoting fine-grained audio discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness\nin enabling difference-telling and detailed discrimination, ADC introduces a\nnotable semantic gap between the input audios-often rich in diverse sound\nevents-and the relatively brief, difference-focused output captions. This\ndeviation from AC-style descriptions leads to a mismatch with the pretraining\nobjective, resulting in catastrophic forgetting during finetuning. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably\nchallenging but gentler alternative that encourages the model to capture the\nshared semantics across audio clips rather than emphasizing their detailed\ndifferences. Experimental results demonstrate that ACC not only effectively\nenhances audio-text understanding on primary captioning benchmarks but also\nbetter preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music-related\ndownstream tasks, such as vocal sound classification (VSC), speech emotion\nrecognition (SER), musical instrument classification (MIC), and music genre\nclassification (MGC), compared to ADC.

In orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based\nframeworks, conventional pilot allocation schemes face a trade-off between\nspectral efficiency (SE) and sensing performance. Interleaved pilots improve\nuser equipment (UE) multiplexing through sparse allocation but reduce the\nmaximum unambiguous range. Conversely, orthogonal block-based pilots reduce\nrange ambiguity but degrade sensing resolution due to limited delay\ngranularity. To address this trade-off, the phase-shifted ISAC (PS-ISAC) scheme\nwas recently proposed for uplink multiple access in ISAC systems. However,\nPS-ISAC suffers from spectral inefficiency due to the fixed cyclic prefix (CP)\nconstraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose adaptive\nphase-shifted-ISAC (APS-ISAC), an enhanced pilot scheme that employs an\noverlapped block-pilot structure with UE-specific phase shifts determined by\nmaximum excess delay of each UE. This design enables UEs to share the same\ntime-frequency resources while preserving separable and contiguous channel\nimpulse responses (CIRs) at the base station (BS). Simulation results show that\nAPS-ISAC significantly outperforms conventional pilot allocation methods in\nterms of SE, approximately doubling the number of multiplexed UEs. It also\nachieves lower mean square error (MSE) under power constraints with reduced\ncomplexity. Furthermore, it yields maximum range resolution and unambiguous\nsensing performance.

Deeper models -- with more layers and more trainable\nparameters -- are generally perceived as being `better' by the SER community.\nThis raises the question -- \\emph{how much better} are modern-era deep neural\nnetworks compared to their earlier iterations? Beyond that, the more important\nquestion of how to move forward remains as poignant as ever.

In the present contribution, we attempt a\nquantification of progress in the 15 years of research beginning with the\nintroduction of the landmark 2009 INTERSPEECH Emotion Challenge. We conduct a\nlarge scale investigation of model architectures, spanning both audio-based\nmodels that rely on speech inputs and text-baed models that rely solely on\ntranscriptions.

The source and destination both have energy harvesting\n(EH) capability with limited battery capacity.

We propose the finite-horizon joint power allocation (FHJPA)\nalgorithm for the finite-horizon RL problem and compare it with a\nlow-complexity greedy algorithm (GA). An infinite-horizon joint power\nallocation (IHJPA) algorithm is also proposed for the corresponding\ninfinite-horizon problem. A comparative analysis of these algorithms is carried\nout in terms of SEE, expected total transmitted secure bits, and computational\ncomplexity. The results show that the FHJPA algorithm outperforms the GA and\nIHJPA algorithms due to its appropriate modelling in finite horizon\ntransmission. When the source node battery has sufficient energy, the GA can\nyield performance close to the FHJPA algorithm despite its low-complexity. When\nthe transmission time horizon increases, the accuracy of the infinite-horizon\nmodel improves, resulting in a reduced performance gap between FHJPA and IHJPA\nalgorithms.

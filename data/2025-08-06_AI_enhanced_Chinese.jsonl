However, this sequential design approach does not fully\naddress the trade-offs between high-frequency and LDO-induced low-frequency\nphase noise. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a co-design\nmethod for low phase-noise LC-tank VCOs powered by LDOs. It is difficult to\ncarry out the co-design using traditional manual design techniques. Hence, an\nefficient AI-driven EDA algorithm is used. To validate the proposed method, a\n5.6 GHz LC-tank VCO with an integrated LDO is designed using a 65 nm CMOS\nprocess.

To address insufficient training data for speech enhancement\nmodels in moving scenarios, this paper proposes Yang's motion spatio-temporal\nsampling reconstruction theory, enabling efficient simulation of motion-induced\ncontinuous time-varying reverberation. It breaks through the limitations of\ntraditional static Image-Source Method (ISM) in time-varying systems by\ndecomposing the moving image source's impulse response into linear\ntime-invariant modulation and discrete time-varying fractional delay,\nestablishing a physics-compliant moving sound field model. Based on the\nband-limited nature of motion displacement, a hierarchical sampling strategy is\nadopted: high sampling rates for low-order images to retain details, and low\nrates for high-order ones to reduce complexity, combined with a fast synthesis\narchitecture for real-time simulation. Experiments show that compared to\nopen-source model GSound, the theory more accurately restores amplitude and\nphase changes in moving scenarios, solving the industry challenge of motion\nsound source data simulation.

This assumption often does\nnot hold in real-world speech systems, where distribution shifts are common due\nto varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker diversity.\n  The method of Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU) augments the input of each\nneural network layer based on the input feature statistics.

Appendix: 4 pages, 6\n  Figures", "summary": "Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature\ndeaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable\nmonitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable\nalternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected\nby drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent\nInference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference\nto correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,\neliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a\ndisentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the\ntrue pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address\nthe lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air\nQuality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR).

Submitted to IEEE", "summary": "Orthogonal signaling limits the number of information symbols transmitted in\nbandwidth $B$ and time $T$ to be $BT$. This corresponds to the Nyquist\nsignaling and is achieved by mounting information symbols on $BT$-dimensional\nbasis spanning the $BT$-dimensional space spaced $\\frac{1}{B}$ and\n$\\frac{1}{T}$ apart. Faster-than-Nyquist signaling involves transmitting more\nthan $BT$ informational symbols in a $BT$-dimensional space. This leads to loss\nof orthogonality. This is achieved by time and/or bandwidth expansion resulting\nfrom packing more information symbols in the same $BT$-dimensional space\n(spacing less than $\\frac{1}{B}$ and/or $\\frac{1}{T}$). In this paper, we take\na different approach to faster-than-Nyquist signaling. We propose to\nsuperimpose the information symbols on one another maintaining the original\nspacing in the Nyquist signaling. We carry this out in the delay-Doppler (DD)\ndomain using Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS)\nmodulation. In Zak-OTFS, the channel varies slowly. Further Zak-OTFS also\nallows construction of mutually unbiased bases the interference between which\nappear like Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme leverages the slow variation in\nthe DD channel to construct a precoder that mitigates the effect of the\ndoubly-spread channel. Further, in the proposed scheme we mount information\nsymbols on two mutually unbiased bases which allows superposition of\ninformation symbols. This simplifies receiver processing to detection in\nGaussian noise since each basis appears to the other as Gaussian noise. This\nreduction makes it possible to use trellis coded modulation to enhance\nbit-error performance.

Without the location information\nsupervision, CSSLoc attempts to learn an insightful metric on the similarity\ndiscrimination of radio data, in such a scenario-agnostic manner that the\nsimilar samples are closely clustered together and different samples are\nseparated in the representation space. Furthermore, the trained feature encoder\ncan be directly transferred for downstream localization tasks, and the location\npredictor is trained to estimate accurate locations with the robustness of\nenvironmental dynamics.

DTDD enables the CF mMIMO system to\nconcurrently serve both uplink~(UL) and downlink~(DL) users with spatially\nseparated \\emph{half-duplex~(HD)} access points~(APs) using the same\ntime-frequency resources. Further, to facilitate ISAC, the UL APs are utilized\nfor both UL data and target echo reception, while the DL APs jointly transmit\nthe precoded DL data streams and target signal. In this context, we present\ncentralized and distributed generalized likelihood-ratio tests~(GLRTs) for\ntarget detection treating UL users' signals as sensing interference. We then\nquantify the optimality and complexity trade-off between distributed and\ncentralized GLRTs and benchmark the respective estimators with the Bayesian\nCram\\'er-Rao lower bound for target radar-cross section~(RCS). Then, we present\na unified framework for joint UL users' data detection and RCS estimation.\nNext, for communication, we derive the signal-to-noise-plus-interference~(SINR)\noptimal combiner accounting for the cross-link and radar interference for UL\ndata processing. In DL, we use regularized zero-forcing for the users and\npropose two types of precoders for the target: one ``user-centric\" that\nnullifies the interference caused by the target signal to the DL users and one\n``target-centric\" based on the dominant eigenvector of the composite channel\nbetween the target and the APs. Finally, numerical studies corroborate with our\ntheoretical findings and reveal that the \\emph{GLRT is robust to inter-AP\ninterference, and DTDD doubles the $90\\%$-likely sum UL-DL SE compared to\ntraditional TDD-based CF-mMIMO ISAC systems}; while using HD hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u5206\u53cc\u5de5\uff08DTDD\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\uff08CF\uff09\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\uff08mMIMO\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7DTDD\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u670d\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u884c\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u884cAP\u8fdb\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fGLRT\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86SINR\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u5206\u53cc\u5de5\uff08DTDD\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fGLRT\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u91cf\u5316\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b3. \u63a8\u5bfcSINR\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u5668\uff1b4. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u578b\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u5fc3\u578b\uff09\u3002", "result": "1.

Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which\ndefines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated\norganisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there\nexists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice\nusing communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the\ncommunication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding\nof the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome\ncommunication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome\ncommunication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a\nmulti-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is\nconceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological\nsignals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart\nagriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of\nagrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed.\nThese applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things\nenabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and\neco-friendly agricultural production.

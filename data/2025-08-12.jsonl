This fragmentation leads to redundant engineering\neffort, inconsistent performance, and limited extensibility. To address this\ngap, we introduce UniFlow, a unified framework that employs continuous\ngenerative modeling to tackle diverse speech front-end tasks in a shared latent\nspace. Specifically, UniFlow utilizes a waveform variational autoencoder (VAE)\nto learn a compact latent representation of raw audio, coupled with a Diffusion\nTransformer (DiT) that predicts latent updates. To differentiate the speech\nprocessing task during the training, learnable condition embeddings indexed by\na task ID are employed to enable maximal parameter sharing while preserving\ntask-specific adaptability. To balance model performance and computational\nefficiency, we investigate and compare three generative objectives: denoising\ndiffusion, flow matching, and mean flow within the latent domain. We validate\nUniFlow on multiple public benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains over\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

Within such systems, hydraulic cylinders are prime\ndevices that convert hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. Some of the\ngenuine and very common problems related to hydraulic cylinders are leakages.\nLeakage in hydraulic systems can cause a drop in pressure, general\ninefficiency, and even complete failure of such systems. The various ways\nleakage can occur define the major categorization of leakage: internal and\nexternal leakage. External leakage is easily noticeable, while internal\nleakage, which involves fluid movement between pressure chambers, can be harder\nto detect and may gradually impact system performance without obvious signs.\nWhen leakage surpasses acceptable limits, it is classified as a fault or\nfailure. In such cases, leakage is divided into three categories: no leakage,\nlow leakage, and high leakage. It suggests a fault detection algorithm with the\nbasic responsibility of detecting minimum leakage within the Hydraulic system,\nand minimizing detection time is the core idea of this paper. In order to fully\ndevelop this idea, experimental data collection of Hydraulic systems is\nrequired. The collected data uses pressure sensors and other signals that are\nsingle-related.

Yet, most\nexisting speech benchmarks focus on single-speaker or isolated tasks,\noverlooking the challenges posed by multi-speaker conversations that are common\nin real-world scenarios. We introduce MSU-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluating multi-speaker conversational understanding with a speaker-centric\ndesign. Our hierarchical framework covers four progressive tiers:\nsingle-speaker static attribute understanding, single-speaker dynamic attribute\nunderstanding, multi-speaker background understanding, and multi-speaker\ninteraction understanding. This structure ensures all tasks are grounded in\nspeaker-centric contexts, from basic perception to complex reasoning across\nmultiple speakers. By evaluating state-of-the-art models on MSU-Bench, we\ndemonstrate that as task complexity increases across the benchmark's tiers, all\nmodels exhibit a significant performance decline. We also observe a persistent\ncapability gap between open-source models and closed-source commercial ones,\nparticularly in multi-speaker interaction reasoning.

The remote\nidentification (Remote ID) is deemed an effective real-time UAV monitoring\nsystem by the federal aviation administration, which holds potentials for\nenabling inter-UAV communications. This paper deeply investigates the\napplication of Remote ID for UAV collision avoidance while minimizing\ncommunication delays. First, we propose a Remote ID based distributed multi-UAV\ncollision avoidance (DMUCA) framework to support the collision detection,\navoidance decision-making, and trajectory recovery. Next, the average\ntransmission delays for Remote ID messages are analyzed, incorporating the\npacket reception mechanisms and packet loss due to interference. The\noptimization problem is formulated to minimize the long-term average\ncommunication delay, where UAVs can flexibly select the Remote ID protocol to\nenhance the collision avoidance performance. To tackle the problem, we design a\nmulti-agent deep Q-network based adaptive communication configuration\nalgorithm, allowing UAVs to autonomously learn the optimal protocol\nconfigurations in dynamic environments. Finally, numerical results verify the\nfeasibility of the proposed DMUCA framework, and the proposed mechanism can\nreduce the average delay by 32% compared to the fixed protocol configuration."}

However, unlike text, speech conveys not only linguistic\ncontent but also rich paralinguistic features. Encoding these elements in an\nentangled fashion may be suboptimal, as it limits flexibility. For instance,\nvoice conversion (VC) aims to convert speaker characteristics while preserving\nthe original linguistic content, which requires a disentangled representation.\nInspired by VC methods utilizing $k$-means quantization with self-supervised\nfeatures to disentangle phonetic information, we develop a discrete NAC capable\nof structured disentanglement.

The factor\nmatrices of multi-linear transformations are parameterized by BDD domain grids\nand SnS factors, where beam domain grids are jointly determined by angles and\nslopes under spatial-chirp based NF representations. To enable tractable\ninference, we replace environment-dependent BDD domain grids with uniformly\nsampled ones, and introduce perturbation parameters in each domain to mitigate\ngrid mismatch. We further propose a hybrid beam domain strategy that integrates\nangle-only sampling with slope hyperparameterization to avoid the computational\nburden of explicit slope sampling.

This decoupling enables coordinated yet independently\nconfigurable designs in the AMAF and T-RIS domains, supporting flexible\nstrategies with diverse complexity-performance trade-offs. Several\nimplementations are analyzed, including diagonal and non-diagonal T-RIS\narchitectures, paired with precoding schemes based on focusing, minimum mean\nsquare error, and eigenmode decomposition. Simulation results demonstrate that\nwhile non-diagonal schemes maximize sum rate in scenarios with a limited number\nof User Equipments (UEs) and high angular separability, they exhibit fairness\nand scalability limitations as UE density increases. Conversely, diagonal T-RIS\nconfigurations, particularly the proposed focusing-based scheme with uniform\nfeeder-side power allocation, offer robust, fair, and scalable performance with\nminimal channel state information. The findings emphasize the critical impact\nof UEs' angular separability and reveal inherent trade-offs among spectral\nefficiency, complexity, and fairness, positioning diagonal AT-RIS architectures\nas practical solutions for scalable near-field MU multiple-input single-output\nsystems."}

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for\n  publication", "summary": "Understanding the performance of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output\n(MU-MIMO) systems under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter\n(CSIT) remains a critical challenge in next-generation wireless networks. In\nthis context, accurate statistical modeling of the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is essential for enabling\ntractable performance analysis of multi-user systems. This paper presents an\nimproved statistical approximation of the SINR for downlink (DL) MU-MIMO\nsystems with imperfect CSIT. The proposed model retains the analytical\nsimplicity of existing approaches (e.g., Gamma-based approximations) while\novercoming their limitations, particularly the underestimation of SINR\nvariance. We evaluate the proposed approximation in the context of\nRate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)-enabled MIMO DL systems with outdated\nCSIT. The results demonstrate excellent accuracy across a wide range of system\nconfigurations, including varying numbers of users, antennas, and degrees of\nCSIT staleness."}

To this\npoint, the term efficiency has been quantified through applications to Spectral\nEfficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE). In this paper we introduce a new\nsystem metric called Radio Resource Utilization Efficiency (RUE). This metric\nquantifies the efficiency of the available radio resources (Spectrum, Access\nMethod, Time Slots, Data Symbols, etc.) used to deliver future 6G demands. We\ncompare the system performance of Typical Cellular and Cell-Free Massive MIMO\ndeployments as a vehicle to demonstrate the need for this new metric. We begin\nby providing a concise treatment of items impacting SE by introducing three\ncategories: 5G Radio Resources, Practical Limitations (such as channel matrix\nrank deficiency) and Implementation Losses (SINR degradation). For the example\nRadio Access Technology configuration analyzed, we show 5G yields an RUE of 47%\n(revealing significant room for improvement when defining 6G). Practical\nlimitation assumptions are compared to 5G Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO)\nmeasurements conducted in a commercialized deployment. SE losses are\ncharacterized to offer guidance to advanced algorithms employing Machine\nLearning (ML) based techniques. We present the benefits of increasing the\ntransmission Bandwidth (BW) from 100MHz to 1.6GHz. We describe a Next\nGeneration RAN architecture that can support 6G and AI-RAN."}

However, unlike text, speech conveys not only linguistic\ncontent but also rich paralinguistic features. Encoding these elements in an\nentangled fashion may be suboptimal, as it limits flexibility. For instance,\nvoice conversion (VC) aims to convert speaker characteristics while preserving\nthe original linguistic content, which requires a disentangled representation.\nInspired by VC methods utilizing $k$-means quantization with self-supervised\nfeatures to disentangle phonetic information, we develop a discrete NAC capable\nof structured disentanglement. Experimental evaluations show that our approach\nachieves reconstruction performance on par with conventional NACs that do not\nexplicitly perform disentanglement, while also matching the effectiveness of\nconventional VC techniques."}

The proposed AVSE system employs convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) for spectral feature extraction and long short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetworks for temporal modeling, enabling robust speech enhancement through\nmultimodal fusion of audio and visual cues. Multiple deployment scenarios are\ninvestigated, including cloud-based, edge-assisted, and standalone device\nimplementations. Their performance is evaluated in terms of speech quality\nimprovement, latency, and computational overhead. Real-world experiments are\nconducted across various network conditions, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 4G, and\n5G, to analyze the trade-offs between processing delay, communication latency,\nand perceptual speech quality. The results show that while cloud deployment\nachieves the highest enhancement quality, edge-assisted architectures offer the\nbest balance between latency and intelligibility, meeting real-time\nrequirements under 5G and Wi-Fi 6 conditions.

However, these benefits are significantly degraded under\nmobility due to channel aging, and further exacerbated by the unique near-field\n(NF) and spatial non-stationarity (SnS) propagation in such systems. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel channel prediction approach that\nincorporates dedicated channel modeling, probabilistic representations, and\nBayesian inference algorithms for this emerging scenario. Specifically, we\ndevelop tensor-structured channel models in both the spatial-frequency-temporal\n(SFT) and beam-delay-Doppler (BDD) domains, which leverage temporal\ncorrelations among multiple pilot symbols for channel prediction. The factor\nmatrices of multi-linear transformations are parameterized by BDD domain grids\nand SnS factors, where beam domain grids are jointly determined by angles and\nslopes under spatial-chirp based NF representations. To enable tractable\ninference, we replace environment-dependent BDD domain grids with uniformly\nsampled ones, and introduce perturbation parameters in each domain to mitigate\ngrid mismatch. We further propose a hybrid beam domain strategy that integrates\nangle-only sampling with slope hyperparameterization to avoid the computational\nburden of explicit slope sampling. Based on the probabilistic models, we\ndevelop tensor-structured bi-layer inference (TS-BLI) algorithm under the\nexpectation-maximization (EM) framework, which reduces computational complexity\nvia tensor operations by leveraging the bi-layer factor graph for approximate\nE-step inference and an alternating strategy with closed-form updates in the\nM-step.

Additionally, we propose an Acoustic\nContext (ACX) representation that refines CLAP embeddings to better handle\nvarious distortion factors and their intensity in speech signals. Unlike\ncontent-based approaches that rely on linguistic and speaker attributes, ACX\nprovides contextual information that enables the restoration model to\ndistinguish and mitigate distortions better.

In\nthis paper, we look at four generative-AI music making systems available to the\npublic as of mid-2025 (AIVA, Stable Audio, Suno, and Udio) and track how they\nare rhetoricized by their developers, and received by users. Our aim is to\ninvestigate ideologies that are driving the early-stage development and\nadoption of generative-AI in music making, with a particular focus on\ndemocratization. A combination of autoethnography and digital ethnography is\nused to examine patterns and incongruities in rhetoric when positioned against\nproduct functionality. The results are then collated to develop a nuanced,\ncontextual discussion.

However, building a unified\nspeech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges:\n(1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens,\nextending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data\nfor fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information\nat different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features,\nwhile understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to\ndifficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these\nchallenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization\nand speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an\nUnderstanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level\nsemantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text\nLLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which\nreduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech\nLLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that\nconcurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a\nunified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and\ngeneration capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision\nloss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and\nenhance speech generation performance.

This\nwork introduces a patient-adaptive focused transmit scheme that has the ability\nto drastically reduce the number of transmits needed to produce a high-quality\nultrasound image.

Besides\nit addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for\nexample, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by\njointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown\nprecoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet\nfollowed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive\n(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet\nchannel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded\nPRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel\nspatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet\nsignificantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a\nwide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB\ngain at high SNRs.

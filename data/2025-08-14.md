*Honggang Jia,Nan Cheng,Xiucheng Wang,Conghao Zhou,Ruijin Sun,Xuemin,Shen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: RadioMamba是一种混合Mamba-UNet架构，用于解决无线电地图构建中的精度与效率权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的无线电地图构建方法存在精度与效率的权衡问题，而准确的构建需要建模长距离空间依赖关系。

Method: RadioMamba采用Mamba-卷积块，Mamba分支以线性复杂度捕获全局依赖，卷积分支提取局部特征。

Result: 实验表明，RadioMamba比现有方法（包括扩散模型）精度更高，速度快近20倍，且仅使用2.9%的模型参数。

Conclusion: RadioMamba通过同时提升精度和效率，为下一代无线系统的实时智能优化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Radio map (RM) has recently attracted much attention since it can provide
real-time and accurate spatial channel information for 6G services and
applications. However, current deep learning-based methods for RM construction
exhibit well known accuracy-efficiency trade-off. In this paper, we introduce
RadioMamba, a hybrid Mamba-UNet architecture for RM construction to address the
trade-off. Generally, accurate RM construction requires modeling long-range
spatial dependencies, reflecting the global nature of wave propagation physics.
RadioMamba utilizes a Mamba-Convolutional block where the Mamba branch captures
these global dependencies with linear complexity, while a parallel
convolutional branch extracts local features. This hybrid design generates
feature representations that capture both global context and local detail.
Experiments show that RadioMamba achieves higher accuracy than existing
methods, including diffusion models, while operating nearly 20 times faster and
using only 2.9\% of the model parameters. By improving both accuracy and
efficiency, RadioMamba presents a viable approach for real-time intelligent
optimization in next generation wireless systems.

*Wenlihan Lu,Shijian Gao,Miaowen Wen,Yuxuan Liang,Chan-Byoung Chae,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的无线电地图重建框架（URAM），通过图推理和深度学习方法优化无人机导航，提高覆盖效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空经济中，无线电地图对无人机无线连接至关重要，但传统导航方式受限于电池容量，覆盖和效率不足。

Method: 结合贝叶斯神经网络实时估计空间不确定性，以及基于注意力的强化学习策略，在概率地图上进行全局推理，规划高效轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，URAM比现有基线重建精度提高34%。

Conclusion: URAM框架通过智能轨迹规划显著提升了无人机导航的效率和准确性。

Abstract: With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become
essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms.
Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using
waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity
significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose
an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly
leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach
integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that
estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based
reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a
probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and
energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent,
non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative
regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that
URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.

### [3] [Generative AI-Enabled Robust 6G Uplink: Principles, Challenges, and Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09348)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: GenCom是一种利用生成式AI解决6G上行链路瓶颈的新系统范式，通过简化发射端设计并利用接收端的强大AI模型重构高语义保真度内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络上行链路面临设备资源限制和信道条件挑战，需要创新解决方案。

Method: GenCom采用生成式AI，简化发射端的源和信道编码设计，接收端利用离线训练的AI模型重构信号。

Result: GenCom在低和不确定的SNR/SINR条件下表现优于传统系统。

Conclusion: GenCom为未来以人为中心、智能和可持续的无线网络提供了潜在解决方案，但仍需解决实际挑战。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks (6G) face a critical uplink bottleneck due
to stringent device-side resource constraints and challenging channel
conditions. This article introduces GenCom, a novel system-level paradigm for
robust 6G uplink that leverages Generative AI and exploits the inherent
resource imbalance between transmitters and receivers. In GenCom, resource-rich
receivers deploy powerful offline-trained GenAI models to reconstruct high
semantic-fidelity content from degraded signals, while resource-constrained
transmitters are simplified in both source and channel coding design. We
present the core mechanisms and key design principles behind GenCom, which
shifts from conventional approaches toward simple semantic-preserving
compression, weak error-distribution codes, and semantic-aware retransmissions.
Through a case study, GenCom is shown to deliver robust performance across a
wide range of low and uncertain SNR/SINR conditions where conventional systems
fail. Finally, we outline critical challenges and research directions toward
making GenCom a practical enabler of future human-centric, intelligent, and
sustainable wireless networks.

### [4] [Satellites are closer than you think: A near field MIMO approach for Ground stations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09374)
*Rohith Reddy Vennam,Luke Wilson,Ish Kumar Jain,Dinesh Bharadia*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: ArrayLink是一种分布式相控阵架构，通过结合多个小型商用面板实现高增益波束成形，提升LEO卫星与地面站之间的回传容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地面站基础设施扩展不足导致的LEO卫星回传容量瓶颈问题。

Method: 采用分布式相控阵架构，结合16个（32x32）面板，实现高增益波束成形和多卫星支持。

Result: ArrayLink在增益、多流支持和范围方面表现优异，接近传统抛物面天线性能。

Conclusion: ArrayLink为提升LEO回传容量提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has
revolutionized broadband access, earth observation, and direct-to-device
connectivity. However, the expansion of ground station infrastructure has not
kept pace, creating a critical bottleneck in satellite-to-ground backhaul
capacity. Traditional parabolic dish antennas, though effective for
geostationary (GEO) satellites, are ill-suited for dense, fastmoving LEO
networks due to mechanical steering delays and their inability to track
multiple satellites simultaneously. Phased array antennas offer electronically
steerable beams and multisatellite support, but their integration into ground
stations is limited by the high cost, hardware issues, and complexity of
achieving sufficient antenna gain. We introduce ArrayLink, a distributed phased
array architecture that coherently combines multiple small commercially
available panels to achieve high-gain beamforming and unlock line-of-sight MIMO
spatial multiplexing with minimal additional capital expenditure. By spacing 16
(32x32) panels across a kilometer-scale aperture, ArrayLink enters the
radiative near-field, focusing energy in both angle and range while supporting
up to four simultaneous spatial streams on a single feeder link. Through
rigorous theoretical analysis, detailed 2D beam pattern simulations and
real-world hardware experiments, we show that ArrayLink (i) achieves dish-class
gain with in range 1-2 dB of 1.47 m reflector, (ii) maintains four parallel
streams at ranges of hundreds of kilometers (falling to two beyond 2000 km),
and (iii) exhibits tight agreement across theory, simulation, and experiment
with minimal variance. These findings open a practical and scalable path to
boosting LEO backhaul capacity.

### [5] [Sub-THz Power Amplifiers: Measurements, Behavioral Modeling and Predistortion Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09545)
*Lutfi Samara,Simon Haussmann,Erind Tufa,Antonio Alberto D'Amico,Tommaso Zugno,Ingmar Kallfass,Thomas Kürner*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了太赫兹（THz）频谱中功率放大器（PA）的非线性问题，提出了表征和预失真算法以改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球IMT流量预计在2020至2030年间增长10-100倍，太赫兹频谱成为满足需求的有前景方案，但其宽带射频组件的非线性问题（如功率放大器的失真）影响了系统性能。

Method: 通过小信号和大信号连续波测量，表征了300 GHz功率放大器的非线性行为，并开发了AM-AM和AM-PM模型。基于模型设计了预失真算法。

Result: 模型验证了压缩行为，但在低输入功率时存在不准确性。预失真算法在多载波和单载波波形切换时性能下降，但通过参数优化可显著改善。

Conclusion: 适当的预失真参数选择能显著提升系统性能，为太赫兹通信中的非线性问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: With global IMT traffic expected to grow 10-100 times from 2020 to 20301, the
Terahertz (THz) spectrum offers a promising solution to satisfy such forecasts.
However, occupying the THz spectrum comes with its own challenges, an important
one being impairments caused by broadband RF components in THz transceivers.
Nonlinearities in power amplifiers (PAs) complicate meeting link budget
requirements, with amplitude and phase distortions degrading the system's
performance, especially when adopting waveforms with high peak-to-average power
ratios (PAPRs), such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). In
this paper, we present characterization results of a 300 GHz PA using
small-signal and large-signal continuous-wave measurements. Models capturing
Amplitude-to- Amplitude Modulation (AM-AM) and Amplitude-to-Phase Modulation
(AMPM) behavior across 270-330 GHz are developed and verified with wideband
measurements, confirming the compression behavior, while nonetheless showing
inaccuracies for low input powers due to unaccounted frequency dependencies.
Based on the derived models, a predistortion algorithm is designed and
analyzed, revealing significant error performance degradation when switching
between single- and multi-carrier waveforms. We finally show that an
appropriate selection of pre-distorter parameters can significantly improve the
performance.

Method: 设计了一种基于消息传递的定位方法，联合检测动态场景中的多径测量，实现低延迟定位，并提出了基于FPGA操作的精确系统延迟模型。

Result: 该方法在分布式阵列元素足够宽的情况下，能够实现与多径定位方法相似的定位性能，同时具有更低的延迟和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法为分布式MIMO系统提供了一种高效、低延迟的定位解决方案，并揭示了硬件利用率和系统级权衡的重要见解。

Abstract: Distributed MIMO and integrated sensing and communication are expected to be
key technologies in future wireless systems, enabling reliable, low-latency
communication and accurate localization. Dedicated localization solutions must
support distributed architecture, provide scalability across different system
configurations and meet strict latency requirements. We present a scalable
message-passing localization method and architecture co-designed for a
panel-based distributed MIMO system and network topology, in which
interconnected units operate without centralized processing. This method
jointly detects line-of-sight paths to distributed units from multipath
measurements in dynamic scenarios, localizes the agent, and achieves very low
latency. Additionally, we introduce a cycle-accurate system latency model based
on implemented FPGA operations, and show important insights into processing
latency and hardware utilization and system-level trade-offs. We compare our
method to a multipath-based localization method and show that it can achieve
similar localization performance, with wide enough distribution of array
elements, while offering lower latency and computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在不干扰系统的情况下准确测量操作符的性能，尤其是在不同架构上的非线性扩展行为。

Method: 采用饱和吞吐量增量方法，结合Operator Performance Quadrant (OPQ)框架，分类操作符的基本成本和扩展成本。

Result: 发现计算密集型操作符（如CRC）呈现超线性行为，而大多数其他操作符为次线性。同时揭示了Arm和x86架构之间的Quadrant Shift现象。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了准确的、架构感知的性能瓶颈诊断，为性能建模和优化提供了现实依据。

Abstract: This paper proposes a saturation throughput delta-based methodology to
precisely measure operator costs in high-speed data planes without intrusive
instrumentation. The approach captures non-linear scaling, revealing that
compute-intensive operators like CRC exhibit super-linear behavior, while most
others are sub-linear. We introduce the Operator Performance Quadrant (OPQ)
framework to classify operators by base and scaling costs, exposing a
cross-architecture Quadrant Shift between Arm and x86. This method provides
accurate, architecture-aware bottleneck diagnosis and a realistic basis for
performance modeling and optimization.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文探讨了V2X通信中的车队调度（Mode 2d）方案，通过分布式资源分配提升车队通信的可靠性和低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车队调度是V2X通信中的关键应用，能提升道路安全和交通效率，但面临高可靠性和低延迟的挑战。

Method: 采用分布式和调度的资源分配方案（Mode 2d），车队从配置的资源池中选择资源，无需网络辅助。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方案能满足车队通信的可靠性、低延迟和数据率需求。

Conclusion: Mode 2d方案是一种有效的车队调度方法，适用于V2X通信中的高要求场景。

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a key technology for enabling
intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that can improve road safety, traffic
efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Among the various V2X
applications, platooning is one of the most promising ones, as it allows a
group of vehicles to travel closely together at high speeds, reducing fuel
consumption and emissions. However, it poses significant challenges for
wireless communication, such as high reliability and low latency. In this
paper, we evaluate the benefits of group scheduling, also referred to as Mode
2d, which is based on a distributed and scheduled resource allocation scheme
that allows the group of cars to select resources from a configured pool
without network assistance. We evaluated the scheme through simulations, and
the results show that this approach can meet the reliability, low latency, and
data rate requirements for platooning.

### [9] [CKFNet: Neural Network Aided Cubature Kalman filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09727)
*Jinhui Hu,Haiquan Zhao,Yi Peng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: CKFNet结合了CKF和RNN，通过动态适应未建模的不确定性，提高了非线性估计的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CKF因模型与环境不匹配导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 在CKF的预测阶段嵌入RNN模块，动态适应不确定性，同时保持CKF的可解释性。

Result: 实验表明CKFNet在准确性和鲁棒性上优于传统方法和现有KalmanNet算法。

Conclusion: CKFNet是一种有效的混合架构，兼具CKF的理论严谨性和RNN的动态适应性。

Abstract: The cubature Kalman filter (CKF), while theoretically rigorous for nonlinear
estimation, often suffers performance degradation due to model-environment
mismatches in practice. To address this limitation, we propose CKFNet-a hybrid
architecture that synergistically integrates recurrent neural networks (RNN)
with the CKF framework while preserving its cubature principles. Unlike
conventional model-driven approaches, CKFNet embeds RNN modules in the
prediction phase to dynamically adapt to unmodeled uncertainties, effectively
reducing cumulative error propagation through temporal noise correlation
learning. Crucially, the architecture maintains CKF's analytical
interpretability via constrained optimization of cubature point distributions.
Numerical simulation experiments have confirmed that our proposed CKFNet
exhibits superior accuracy and robustness compared to conventional model-based
methods and existing KalmanNet algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统去噪技术需要先验知识或高训练开销的问题，适应动态信道条件。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法能有效适应动态信道条件，显著减少信道估计误差。

Conclusion: 提出的策略和方法在MIMO-OFDM系统中具有实际应用价值，提升了信道去噪的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Channel denoising is a practical and effective technique for mitigating
channel estimation errors in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. However, adapting
denoising techniques to varying channel conditions typically requires prior
knowledge or incurs significant training overhead. To address these challenges,
we propose a standard-compatible strategy for generating online training data
that enables online adaptive channel denoising. The key idea is to leverage
high-quality channel estimates obtained via data-aided channel estimation as
practical substitutes for unavailable ground-truth channels. Our data-aided
method exploits adjacent detected data symbols within a specific time-frequency
neighborhood as virtual reference signals, and we analytically derive the
optimal size of this neighborhood to minimize the mean squared error of the
resulting estimates. By leveraging the proposed strategy, we devise two channel
denoising approaches, one based on transfer learning, which fine-tunes a
pre-trained denoising neural network, and the other based on meta learning,
which rapidly adapts to new channel environments with minimal updates.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively adapt to
dynamic channel conditions and significantly reduce channel estimation errors
compared to conventional techniques.

### [11] [Location Privacy-Enabled Beamforming in ISAC Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09882)
*Umair Ali Khan,Lester Ho,Holger Claussen,Chinmoy Kundu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向到达混淆比（DAOR）的波束成形框架，用于在ISAC场景中保护发射机位置隐私，同时优化通信速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC技术虽然能同时实现环境感知和数据传输，但会暴露用户位置，因此需要一种保护隐私的方法。

Method: 通过广义特征值分析推导DAOR的闭式边界，并设计非凸优化问题，利用半定松弛、特征模式选择和最优功率分配求解。

Result: 提出的DAOR波束成形在保护隐私和通信速率之间取得平衡，且次优设计在10 dB SNR下计算时间减少85%。

Conclusion: DAOR框架有效保护位置隐私且不影响LOS路径，次优设计在性能和复杂度间取得良好折衷。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology enables simultaneous
environmental perception and data transmission in wireless networks; however,
it also exposes user location to receivers. In this paper, we introduce a novel
beamforming framework guided by the proposed privacy metric direction of
arrival obfuscation ratio (DAOR) to protect transmitter location privacy in
ISAC scenarios. Unlike previous approaches, we do not suppress the
line-of-sight (LOS) component while reshaping the angular power distribution so
that a false direction appears dominant at the receiver. We derive closed-form
bounds on the feasible DAOR via generalized eigenvalue analysis and formulate
an achievable rate-maximization problem under the DAOR constraint. The
resulting problem is non-convex, which is efficiently solved using semidefinite
relaxation, eigenmode selection, and optimal power allocation. A suboptimal
design strategy is also proposed with reduced complexity. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed DAOR-based beamformer achieves a trade-off
between location privacy and communication rate without nullifying the LOS
path. Results also show that a suboptimal design achieves a near-optimal
communication rate with nearly an 85% reduction in computation time at a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的二次电子成像技术模型，通过混合分布描述电子计数，显著提高了边缘定位的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积模型仅描述二次电子计数的均值，忽略了其分布的复杂性，限制了分辨率。

Method: 提出混合分布模型，推导了Fisher信息和最大似然估计（MLE），并通过蒙特卡洛模拟和实际HIM数据集验证。

Result: MLE在时间分辨测量中实现了5倍RMSE降低，实际数据中平均降低5.4倍。

Conclusion: 混合分布模型优于传统方法，显著提升了边缘定位精度，可用于优化光束直径和扫描间距。

Abstract: Secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques, such as scanning electron
microscopy and helium ion microscopy (HIM), use electrons emitted by a sample
in response to a focused beam of charged particles incident at a grid of raster
scan positions. Spot size -- the diameter of the incident beam's spatial
profile -- is one of the limiting factors for resolution, along with various
sources of noise in the SE signal. The effect of the beam spatial profile is
commonly understood as convolutional. We show that under a simple and plausible
physical abstraction for the beam, though convolution describes the mean of the
SE counts, the full distribution of SE counts is a mixture. We demonstrate that
this more detailed modeling can enable resolution improvements over
conventional estimators through a stylized application in semiconductor
inspection of localizing the edge in a two-valued sample. We derive Fisher
information about edge location in conventional and time-resolved measurements
(TRM) and also derive the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the latter.
Empirically, the MLE computed from TRM is approximately efficient except at
very low beam diameter, so Fisher information comparisons are predictive of
performance and can be used to optimize the beam diameter relative to the
raster scan spacing. Monte Carlo simulations show that the MLE gives a 5-fold
reduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) of edge localization as compared to
conventional interpolation-based estimation. Applied to three real HIM
datasets, the average RMSE reduction factor is 5.4.

Result: 实验表明，分层优化（分离识别与翻译任务）在性能上优于标准优化方法。

Conclusion: 分层多目标优化是构建高效、可扩展多任务语音处理模型的更优方法。

Abstract: Training a single model for multilingual, multi-task speech processing (MSP)
is severely hampered by conflicting objectives between tasks like speech
recognition and translation. While multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to
align gradient updates, its effectiveness diminishes as the number of tasks
grows, making it difficult to find a common descent direction. This raises a
fundamental question: should highly conflicting objectives be optimized jointly
or separated into a hierarchical structure? To address this question, this
paper investigates three multi-objective MSP formulations, which we refer to as
\textbf{objective soup recipes}. These formulations apply multi-objective
optimization at different optimization levels to mitigate potential conflicts
among all objectives. To ensure efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
layer-selection mechanism that computes the conflict-avoiding gradient using
only the most problematic layers, minimizing computational and memory overhead.
Extensive experiments on CoVoST v2, LibriSpeech, and AISHELL-1 reveal that a
bi-level recipe separating recognition and translation tasks consistently
outperforms standard flat optimization. Our work demonstrates that hierarchical
MOO is a more effective and scalable approach for building state-of-the-art MSP
models. Our code has been released at

bidirectional Mamba to capture both local and global artifacts. Our core
innovation introduces three efficient encoders: TransBiMamba, ConBiMamba, and

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种独立模型ProMode，用于从文本生成韵律特征（如F0和能量），并在TTS等下游任务中应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 韵律传达了丰富的情感和语义信息，以及个体特征，但现有方法在韵律建模上仍有改进空间。

Method: ProMode编码器输入部分掩码的声学特征和时间对齐的文本内容，生成固定长度的潜在韵律嵌入；解码器利用嵌入和未掩码文本预测掩码区域的声学特征。

Result: 在GigaSpeech数据集上训练，模型在F0和能量预测上优于现有风格编码器，且在TTS系统中表现出更高的韵律偏好。

Conclusion: ProMode在韵律建模任务中具有潜力，尤其在需要精细韵律控制的场景。

Abstract: Prosody conveys rich emotional and semantic information of the speech signal
as well as individual idiosyncrasies. We propose a stand-alone model that maps
text-to-prosodic features such as F0 and energy and can be used in downstream
tasks such as TTS. The ProMode encoder takes as input acoustic features and
time-aligned textual content, both are partially masked, and obtains a
fixed-length latent prosodic embedding. The decoder predicts acoustics in the
masked region using both the encoded prosody input and unmasked textual
content. Trained on the GigaSpeech dataset, we compare our method with
state-of-the-art style encoders. For F0 and energy predictions, we show
consistent improvements for our model at different levels of granularity. We
also integrate these predicted prosodic features into a TTS system and conduct
perceptual tests, which show higher prosody preference compared to the
baselines, demonstrating the model's potential in tasks where prosody modeling
is important.

Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot speech generation have enabled models to
synthesize speech that mimics speaker identity and speaking style from speech
prompts. However, these models' effectiveness is significantly limited in
real-world scenarios where high-quality speech prompts are absent, incomplete,
or out of domain. This issue arises primarily from a significant quality
mismatch between the speech data utilized for model training and the input
prompt speech during inference. To address this, we introduce
$\text{M}^3\text{PDB}$, the first large-scale, multi-modal, multi-label, and
multilingual prompt database designed for robust prompt selection in speech
generation. Our dataset construction leverages a novel multi-modal, multi-agent
annotation framework, enabling precise and hierarchical labeling across diverse
modalities. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight yet effective prompt
selection strategy tailored for real-time, resource-constrained inference
settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed database and
selection strategy effectively support various challenging speech generation
scenarios. We hope our work can inspire the community to shift focus from
improving performance on standard benchmarks to addressing more realistic and
diverse application scenarios in speech generation. Code and dataset are

*Carlos Franzreb,Arnab Das,Tim Polzehl,Sebastian Möller*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的隐私评估方法，通过添加目标分类器来更准确地评估说话人匿名化中的隐私保护效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前说话人匿名化的隐私评估方法在使用同性别目标选择算法（TSA）时高估了隐私保护效果，忽略了匿名化语音中同时包含源说话人和目标说话人信息的问题。

Method: 提出添加目标分类器来测量目标说话人信息的影响，并通过对抗学习移除这些信息。

Result: 实验证明该方法对多种匿名化器有效，尤其是在使用同性别TSA时，评估更可靠。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地评估说话人匿名化的隐私保护效果，特别是在同性别TSA的情况下。

Abstract: The current privacy evaluation for speaker anonymization often overestimates
privacy when a same-gender target selection algorithm (TSA) is used, although
this TSA leaks the speaker's gender and should hence be more vulnerable. We
hypothesize that this occurs because the evaluation does not account for the
fact that anonymized speech contains information from both the source and
target speakers. To address this, we propose to add a target classifier that
measures the influence of target speaker information in the evaluation, which
can also be removed with adversarial learning. Experiments demonstrate that
this approach is effective for multiple anonymizers, particularly when using a
same-gender TSA, leading to a more reliable assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有语音对话系统在共情交互中依赖大规模数据集、缺乏副语言线索提取以及共情专用数据集和评估框架的问题。

Method: 提出三阶段训练策略和语言-副语言双思维机制，结合EChat-200K数据集和EChat-eval评估框架。

Result: 实验表明OSUM-EChat在共情响应能力上优于现有端到端模型。

Conclusion: OSUM-EChat有效提升了语音对话系统的共情能力，为资源有限场景提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Empathy is crucial in enabling natural interactions within spoken dialogue
systems, allowing machines to recognize and respond appropriately to
paralinguistic cues such as age, gender, and emotion. Recent advancements in
end-to-end speech language models, which unify speech understanding and
generation, provide promising solutions. However, several challenges persist,
including an over-reliance on large-scale dialogue datasets, insufficient
extraction of paralinguistic cues vital for conveying empathy, and the lack of
empathy-specific datasets and evaluation frameworks. To address these issues,
we introduce OSUM-EChat, an open-source, end-to-end spoken dialogue system
designed to enhance empathetic interactions, particularly in resource-limited
settings. OSUM-EChat introduces two key innovations: (1) a three-stage
understanding-driven spoken dialogue training strategy that extends the
capabilities of a large speech understanding model to spoken dialogue tasks,
and (2) a linguistic-paralinguistic dual thinking mechanism that integrates
paralinguistic understanding through a chain of thought with dialogue
generation, enabling the system to produce more empathetic responses. This
approach reduces reliance on large-scale dialogue datasets while maintaining
high-quality empathetic interactions. Additionally, we introduce the EChat-200K
dataset, a rich corpus of empathetic speech-to-speech dialogues, and the
EChat-eval benchmark, a comprehensive framework for evaluating the empathetic
capabilities of dialogue systems. Experimental results demonstrate that
OSUM-EChat outperforms end-to-end spoken dialogue models regarding empathetic
responsiveness, validating its effectiveness.

Result: 在基准数据集上，HingeNet在节拍和强拍跟踪任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HingeNet是一种通用且高效的微调方法，适用于节拍跟踪任务，并能与多种预训练模型有效集成。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained foundation models has made significant progress in
music information retrieval. However, applying these models to beat tracking
tasks remains unexplored as the limited annotated data renders conventional
fine-tuning methods ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose
HingeNet, a novel and general parameter-efficient fine-tuning method
specifically designed for beat tracking tasks. HingeNet is a lightweight and
separable network, visually resembling a hinge, designed to tightly interface
with pre-trained foundation models by using their intermediate feature
representations as input. This unique architecture grants HingeNet broad
generalizability, enabling effective integration with various pre-trained
foundation models. Furthermore, considering the significance of harmonics in
beat tracking, we introduce harmonic-aware mechanism during the fine-tuning
process to better capture and emphasize the harmonic structures in musical
signals. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HingeNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance in beat and downbeat tracking

Result: 实验表明，BeatFM在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的节拍和重拍跟踪性能。

Conclusion: BeatFM通过预训练模型和语义聚合模块，有效解决了节拍跟踪中的数据稀缺和泛化问题。

Abstract: Beat tracking is a widely researched topic in music information retrieval.
However, current beat tracking methods face challenges due to the scarcity of
labeled data, which limits their ability to generalize across diverse musical
styles and accurately capture complex rhythmic structures. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel beat tracking paradigm BeatFM, which introduces
a pre-trained music foundation model and leverages its rich semantic knowledge
to improve beat tracking performance. Pre-training on diverse music datasets
endows music foundation models with a robust understanding of music, thereby
effectively addressing these challenges. To further adapt it for beat tracking,
we design a plug-and-play multi-dimensional semantic aggregation module, which
is composed of three parallel sub-modules, each focusing on semantic
aggregation in the temporal, frequency, and channel domains, respectively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in beat and downbeat tracking across multiple benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同ASR架构在领域不匹配下的表现，以了解其泛化能力。

Method: 通过合成目标领域音频，结合目标领域语言模型进行领域适应，比较不同建模选择（如标签单元、上下文长度和拓扑结构）。

Result: 在领域偏移下，具体建模选择（而非架构选择）对性能影响更大。

Conclusion: ASR性能受具体建模选择影响，而非架构类型，为领域适应提供了新见解。

Abstract: We analyze automatic speech recognition (ASR) modeling choices under domain
mismatch, comparing classic modular and novel sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)
architectures. Across the different ASR architectures, we examine a spectrum of
modeling choices, including label units, context length, and topology. To
isolate language domain effects from acoustic variation, we synthesize target
domain audio using a text-to-speech system trained on LibriSpeech. We
incorporate target domain n-gram and neural language models for domain
adaptation without retraining the acoustic model. To our knowledge, this is the
first controlled comparison of optimized ASR systems across state-of-the-art
architectures under domain shift, offering insights into their generalization.
The results show that, under domain shift, rather than the decoder architecture
choice or the distinction between classic modular and novel seq2seq models, it
is specific modeling choices that influence performance.

Result: 在Librispeech 960h任务上进行了实验验证。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法确保了系统组合结果的一致性，提升了性能。

Abstract: Combination approaches for speech recognition (ASR) systems cover structured
sentence-level or word-based merging techniques as well as combination of model
scores during beam search. In this work, we compare model combination across
popular ASR architectures. Our method leverages the complementary strengths of
different models in exploring diverse portions of the search space. We rescore
a joint hypothesis list of two model candidates. We then identify the best
hypothesis through log-linear combination of these sequence-level scores. While
model combination during first-pass recognition may yield improved performance,
it introduces variability due to differing decoding methods, making direct
comparison more challenging. Our two-pass method ensures consistent comparisons
across all system combination results presented in this study. We evaluate
model pair candidates with varying architectures and label topologies and
units. Experimental results are provided for the Librispeech 960h task.

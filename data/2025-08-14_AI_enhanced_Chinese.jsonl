While multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to\nalign gradient updates, its effectiveness diminishes as the number of tasks\ngrows, making it difficult to find a common descent direction. This raises a\nfundamental question: should highly conflicting objectives be optimized jointly\nor separated into a hierarchical structure? To address this question, this\npaper investigates three multi-objective MSP formulations, which we refer to as\n\\textbf{objective soup recipes}. These formulations apply multi-objective\noptimization at different optimization levels to mitigate potential conflicts\namong all objectives. To ensure efficiency, we introduce a lightweight\nlayer-selection mechanism that computes the conflict-avoiding gradient using\nonly the most problematic layers, minimizing computational and memory overhead.\nExtensive experiments on CoVoST v2, LibriSpeech, and AISHELL-1 reveal that a\nbi-level recipe separating recognition and translation tasks consistently\noutperforms standard flat optimization. Our work demonstrates that hierarchical\nMOO is a more effective and scalable approach for building state-of-the-art MSP\nmodels.

However, several challenges persist,\nincluding an over-reliance on large-scale dialogue datasets, insufficient\nextraction of paralinguistic cues vital for conveying empathy, and the lack of\nempathy-specific datasets and evaluation frameworks.

In\nthis paper, we present characterization results of a 300 GHz PA using\nsmall-signal and large-signal continuous-wave measurements. Models capturing\nAmplitude-to- Amplitude Modulation (AM-AM) and Amplitude-to-Phase Modulation\n(AMPM) behavior across 270-330 GHz are developed and verified with wideband\nmeasurements, confirming the compression behavior, while nonetheless showing\ninaccuracies for low input powers due to unaccounted frequency dependencies.\nBased on the derived models, a predistortion algorithm is designed and\nanalyzed, revealing significant error performance degradation when switching\nbetween single- and multi-carrier waveforms. We finally show that an\nappropriate selection of pre-distorter parameters can significantly improve the\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\uff08THz\uff09\u9891\u8c31\u4e2d\u529f\u7387\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff08PA\uff09\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u9884\u5931\u771f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5168\u7403IMT\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u8ba1\u57282020\u81f32030\u5e74\u95f4\u589e\u957f10-100\u500d\uff0c\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u9891\u8c31\u6210\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bbd\u5e26\u5c04\u9891\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u529f\u7387\u653e\u5927\u5668\u7684\u5931\u771f\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5927\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8868\u5f81\u4e86300 GHz\u529f\u7387\u653e\u5927\u5668\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86AM-AM\u548cAM-PM\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9884\u5931\u771f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f4e\u8f93\u5165\u529f\u7387\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u9884\u5931\u771f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8f7d\u6ce2\u548c\u5355\u8f7d\u6ce2\u6ce2\u5f62\u5207\u6362\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u9884\u5931\u771f\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose CKFNet-a hybrid\narchitecture that synergistically integrates recurrent neural networks (RNN)\nwith the CKF framework while preserving its cubature principles. Unlike\nconventional model-driven approaches, CKFNet embeds RNN modules in the\nprediction phase to dynamically adapt to unmodeled uncertainties, effectively\nreducing cumulative error propagation through temporal noise correlation\nlearning. Crucially, the architecture maintains CKF's analytical\ninterpretability via constrained optimization of cubature point distributions.\nNumerical simulation experiments have confirmed that our proposed CKFNet\nexhibits superior accuracy and robustness compared to conventional model-based\nmethods and existing KalmanNet algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "CKFNet\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86CKF\u548cRNN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CKF\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728CKF\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u9636\u6bb5\u5d4c\u5165RNN\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301CKF\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCKFNet\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709KalmanNet\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CKFNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u517c\u5177CKF\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548cRNN\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

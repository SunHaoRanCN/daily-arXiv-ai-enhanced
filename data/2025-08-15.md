### [1] [Comparative Analysis of Attention Mechanisms for Automatic Modulation Classification in Radio Frequency Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09996)
*Ferhat Ozgur Catak,Murat Kuzlu,Umit Cali*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种注意力机制（多头注意力、因果注意力和稀疏注意力）与CNN结合在RF信号分类中的表现，提出了一种新的CNN-Transformer混合架构，实验结果显示基线注意力准确率最高，但因果和稀疏注意力在计算效率上优势显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索不同注意力机制在无线电信号自动调制分类中的效果，以优化实时信号处理的效率和性能。

Method: 采用CNN-Transformer混合架构，结合三种注意力机制（多头、因果、稀疏），在RML2016.10a数据集上评估其对I/Q样本的时序依赖性捕捉能力。

Result: 基线注意力准确率最高（85.05%），因果和稀疏注意力分别减少83%和75%的推理时间，同时保持84%以上的分类性能。

Conclusion: 不同调制方案对注意力模式有偏好，研究结果为实时无线电信号处理中高效注意力机制的设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a critical component in
cognitive radio systems and spectrum management applications. This study
presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of three attention mechanisms
(i.e., baseline multi-head attention, causal attention, and sparse attention)
integrated with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for radio frequency (RF)
signal classification. It proposes a novel CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture
that leverages different attention patterns to capture temporal dependencies in
I/Q samples from the RML2016.10a dataset. The experimental results demonstrate
that while baseline attention achieves the highest accuracy of 85.05\%, causal
and sparse attention mechanisms offer significant computational advantages with
inference times reduced by 83\% and 75\% respectively, while maintaining
competitive classification performance above 84\%. The analysis reveals
distinct attention pattern preferences across different modulation schemes,
providing insights for designing efficient attention mechanisms for real-time
radio signal processing applications.

### [2] [Information Retention in Iterative Random Projection of Convex Bodies to Lower Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10218)
*Nazanin Mirhosseini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了有界凸体通过两次随机正交投影后的信息保留问题，推导了条件互信息的上界，并扩展到多次迭代，探讨了凸体对称性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高维空间中有界凸体在连续降维过程中信息保留的量化问题。

Method: 通过随机正交投影将凸体从R^n降维到R^{n-1}和R^{n-2}，推导条件互信息的上界，并推广到m次迭代。

Result: 建立了条件互信息的上界，并分析了凸体对称性对上界可达性的影响。

Conclusion: 对称性对信息保留的上界可达性有显著影响，为高维数据降维提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a bounded convex body $K_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$
subjected to two successive random orthogonal projections onto
$\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$, respectively. First, we project
$K_0$ orthogonally onto $U_{1}^{\perp}$, the orthogonal complement of
$\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$, where $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$ is uniformly
distributed on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$. This yields a random convex body $K_1
= \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_1}^{\perp}}(K_0) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. We then repeat
the process, projecting $K_1$ orthogonally onto ${U}_{2}^{\perp}$, the
orthogonal complement of $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_2$ chosen uniformly from the
unit sphere in $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_{1}^{\perp}$ or $S^{n-2}$, resulting in a
second random convex body $K_2 = \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_2}^{\perp}}(K_1) \subset
\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$. To quantify information retention through these sequential
dimension reductions, we derive an upper bound for the conditional mutual
information $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$. Furthermore, we extend this process to $m$
iterations and generalize the upper bound on $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$ to establish
an analogous upper bound for $I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$. Finally, we examine the
influence of $K_0$'s symmetry on the achievability of this upper bound for
$I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$.

### [3] [A Deep Learning based Signal Dimension Estimator with Single Snapshot Signal in Phased Array Radar Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10263)
*Yugang Ma,Yonghong Zeng,Sumei Sun,Gary Lee,Ernest Kurniawan,Francois Chin Po Shin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的信号维度估计器（DLSDE），适用于单次观测的相控阵雷达，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号维度是许多高分辨率延迟估计和方向查找算法的前提，正确估计信号维度至关重要。

Method: 使用二维卷积神经网络（2D-CNN）自动提取信号维度特征，无需依赖特征分解和信息准则。

Result: 在32天线相控阵雷达中，DLSDE将检测信噪比提高>15dB，分辨率提高>1度。

Conclusion: DLSDE适用于空间相关或角度分离小的信号，且仅需单次观测信号，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Signal dimension, defined here as the number of copies with different delays
or angular shifts, is a prerequisite for many high-resolution delay estimation
and direction-finding algorithms in sensing and communication systems. Thus,
correctly estimating signal dimension itself becomes crucial. In this paper, we
present a deep learning-based signal dimension estimator (DLSDE) with
single-snapshot observation in the example application of phased array radar.
Unlike traditional model-based and existing deep learning-based signal
dimension estimators relying on eigen-decomposition and information criterion,
to which multiple data snapshots would be needed, the proposed DLSDE uses
two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) to automatically develop
features corresponding to the dimension of the received signal. Our study shows
that DLSDE significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of the
successful detection rate and resolution. In a phased array radar with 32
antenna elements, DLSDE improves detection Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) by >15dB
and resolution by >1{\deg}. This makes the proposed method suitable for
distinguishing multiple signals that are spatially correlated or have small
angular separation. More importantly, our solution operates with a single
snapshot signal, which is incompatible with other existing deep learning-based
methods.

### [4] [Environment Reconstruction in Terahertz Monostatic Sensing: Joint Millimeter-level Geometry Mapping and Material Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10372)
*Zitong Fang,Yejian Lyu,Ziming Yu,Chong Han*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效计算框架，结合CCA辅助的MPC估计和滑动窗口细化策略，用于THz ISAC系统的环境重建，实现毫米级几何映射和可靠材料分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升THz ISAC系统的环境感知能力，实现高精度环境重建和材料识别。

Method: 结合CCA加速参数提取和SAGE估计，采用滑动窗口细化策略优化几何映射；通过反射损失分析分类信道成分，利用THz-TDS数据库进行材料识别。

Result: 几何映射平均距离误差4.9毫米，比文献提升一个数量级；材料分类可靠，验证了毫米级精度。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了THz ISAC系统的环境感知能力，为高精度环境重建和材料识别提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers high-speed
communication alongside precise environmental sensing. This paper presents a
computationally efficient framework for THz-based environment reconstruction by
integrating connected component analysis (CCA)-assisted multipath component
(MPC) estimation with a sliding-window refinement strategy. To start with, a
monostatic sensing experiment is conducted in an indoor scenario using a vector
network analyzer (VNA)-based sounder operating from 290 to 310 GHz. On one
hand, as for geometry mapping, a CCA-based region search is employed to
accelerate parameter extraction, significantly reducing the search space for
space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE)-based estimation
and achieving an 8.4 times acceleration, while preserving resolution. Further
analysis of the connected component structure enables the identification of
indoor features such as flat walls and corners. A sliding-window refinement
applied to the identified regions improves geometric mapping, achieving the
mean distance error of 4.9 mm, which is one order of magnitude better than the
literature. On the other hand, the deterministic and stochastic components of
the monostatic channel are classified through reflection loss analysis. Then,
material identification is performed by looking up the reflection loss in a THz
time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) database, which comprises over 200 materials
across a 0-6 THz range. Experimental results validate millimeter-level accuracy
in geometry mapping and reliable material classification, enhancing the
environmental awareness capabilities of THz ISAC systems.

### [5] [Interleaved Transceiver Design for a Continuous- Transmission MIMO-OFDM ISAC System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10430)
*Yating Chen,Cai Wen,Yan Huang,Jinye Peng,Wei Hong,Timothy N. Davidson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于OFDM波形的MIMO ISAC系统的交织收发器设计方法，优化了通信和雷达性能，并解决了硬件实现中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一种高效的MIMO ISAC系统，同时优化通信和雷达性能，解决交织传输架构中的干扰和硬件限制问题。

Method: 采用交替优化（AO）框架，结合连续凸近似（SCA）和交替方向惩罚法（ADPM），优化传输信号和接收滤波器设计。

Result: 数值模拟验证了设计在雷达感知和通信中的优越性能，且快速算法显著提升了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了通信和雷达性能，解决了硬件实现中的关键问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes an interleaved transceiver design method for a
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) system utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms. We consider a continuous transmission system and focus on the design
of the transmission signal and a receiving filter in the time domain for an
interleaved transmission architecture. For communication performance,
constructive interference (CI) is integrated into the optimization problem. For
radar sensing performance, the integrated mainlobe-to-sidelobe ratio (IMSR) of
the beampattern is considered to ensure desirable directivity. Additionally, we
tackle the challenges of inter-block interference and eliminate the spurious
peaks, which are crucial for accurate target detection. Regarding the hardware
implementation aspect, the power of each time sample is constrained to manage
the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The design problem is addressed using
an alternating optimization (AO) framework, with the subproblem for transmitted
waveform design being solved via the successive convex approximation (SCA)
method. To further enhance computational efficiency, the alternate direction
penalty method (ADPM) is employed to solve the subproblems within the SCA
iterations. The convergence of ADPM is established, with convergence of the
case of more than two auxiliary variables being established for the first time.
Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our transceiver design in
achieving desirable performance in both radar sensing and communication, with
the fast algorithm achieving comparable performance with greater computational
efficiency.

### [6] [Second Order Channel Statistics: An Analysis for Optimal Single-user RIS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10476)
*Amy S. Inwood,Peter J. Smith,Philippa A. Martin,Graeme K. Woodward*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了可重构智能表面（RIS）中信道状态信息获取的挑战，重点分析了时空行为，推导了电平交叉率（LCR）和平均衰落持续时间（AFD），并验证了RIS对信道变化的实际影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 被动RIS无法生成导频信号或处理数据，导致信道快速变化问题未充分研究，因此需要分析RIS系统的时空行为。

Method: 利用二阶统计量分析单用户RIS系统的时空行为，推导LoS条件下的LCR和AFD，并提出了数值稳定的近似方法。

Result: 仿真验证了分析结果，表明RIS并未显著放大信道变化。

Conclusion: RIS对信道变化的放大作用有限，为系统设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: A key challenge facing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is channel
state information acquisition. Passive RISs cannot generate pilot signals or
process data, making rapid temporal changes in the channel problematic.
Additionally, the impact of spatial changes in RIS channels has not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, in this work, we use second order
statistics to investigate the spatio-temporal behaviour of a single-user (SU)
RIS system. Assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) RIS to base station (BS) link, we
derive an exact expression for the level crossing rate (LCR) of the RIS link
(user equipment (UE)-RIS-BS path) and propose a numerically stable
approximation for the LCR of the global UE-BS channel. Each LCR expression
attained is then utilised to find the corresponding average fade duration
(AFD). The temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) correlation is also derived
assuming an LoS RIS-BS link. Assuming a Ricean RIS-BS link, expressions for the
spatial correlation matrix of the global channel and the mean SNR loss due to
channel ageing are derived. All of the analyses are verified by simulation, and
the impact of key system parameters is investigated. We show that the use of an
RIS does not significantly amplify changes in the channel.

Result: 首次给出了非中心卡方随机场的欧拉特性密度的闭式表达式，并验证了信道变化对HSP的关键作用。

Conclusion: Ricean信道中的CFAS性能受信道变化显著影响，尤其是在高信噪比区域。

Abstract: We consider a single-user (SU) continuous fluid antenna system (CFAS)
employing matched filtering (MF) operating over a Ricean fading channel.
Focusing on the upper tail of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
distribution (the high SNR probability (HSP)), we derive accurate
approximations for the HSP in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions using the expected Euler
characteristic (EEC), presenting the first analytical results for a CFAS in a
Ricean environment. In the process, we provide the first closed-form expression
for the Euler characteristic density of a non-central chi-squared random field.
We then examine the impact of the Ricean K-factor on the CFAS performance,
emphasizing the critical role of channel variations in achieving a strong HSP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何更有效地分析雷达截面测量数据，提取目标部件的雷达截面。

Method: 比较反投影和迭代平滑重加权ℓ1最小化两种方法。

Result: 反投影稳健且准确，但分辨率有限；迭代方法适用于密集散射体，但精度较低。

Conclusion: 反投影适合一般场景，而迭代方法更适合密集散射体分析。

Abstract: Radar Cross Section measurement data is often analyzed using Inverse
Synthetic Aperture Radar images. This paper compares backprojection and
iterative smooth reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization as methods to analyze radar
cross section measurements and extract radar cross section for parts of the
measured object. The main conclusion is that using backprojection images to
extract RCS is robust and accurate but is more limited by the resolution than
iterative smooth reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization. The latter method can be
used for closely spaced scatterers but is limited in accuracy.

### [9] [Unsupervised Deep Equilibrium Model Learning for Large-Scale Channel Estimation with Performance Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10546)
*Haotian Tian,Lixiang Lian*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无监督学习的深度均衡模型（DEQ）框架，用于大规模信道估计（LCE），无需真实信道标签，通过GSURE损失函数实现性能保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督深度学习方法依赖真实信道标签，限制了实际应用，因此探索无监督学习方法。

Method: 结合GSURE损失函数和DEQ模型，直接学习参数化迭代过程的固定点，理论证明可实现监督性能。

Result: 理论证明和仿真表明，该方法在无真实标签时显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督DEQ框架在LCE中具有实际应用潜力，性能接近监督方法。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning methods have shown promise for large-scale channel
estimation (LCE), but their reliance on ground-truth channel labels greatly
limits their practicality in real-world systems. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised learning framework for LCE that does not require ground-truth
channels. The proposed approach leverages Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk
Estimate (GSURE) as a principled unsupervised loss function, which provides an
unbiased estimate of the projected mean-squared error (PMSE) from compressed
noisy measurements. To ensure a guaranteed performance, we integrate a deep
equilibrium (DEQ) model, which implicitly represents an infinite-depth network
by directly learning the fixed point of a parameterized iterative process. We
theoretically prove that, under mild conditions, the proposed GSURE-based
unsupervised DEQ learning can achieve oracle-level supervised performance. In
particular, we show that the DEQ architecture inherently enforces a
compressible solution. We then demonstrate that DEQ-induced compressibility
ensures that optimizing the projected error via GSURE suffices to guarantee a
good MSE performance, enabling a rigorous performance guarantee. Extensive
simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly outperforms various baselines when ground-truth channel
is unavailable.

*Clément Thomas,Laurent Jacques,Marc Georges*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了用经典折射透镜替代衍射透镜进行压缩光谱成像的可行性，以降低成本并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测仪器通常复杂昂贵且数据量大，压缩光谱成像是一种更经济高效的技术。

Method: 通过利用透镜的色差特性，替代昂贵的衍射透镜，并进行模拟测试。信号恢复采用Douglas-Rashford算法解决基追踪问题。

Result: 研究表明，使用折射透镜替代衍射透镜在压缩光谱成像中是可行的。

Conclusion: 该方法为地球观测提供了一种更经济、高效的解决方案，减少了复杂性和成本。

Abstract: Earth observation from space is an important scientific and industrial
activity that has applications in many sectors. The instruments employed are
often large, complex, and expensive. In addition, they generate large amounts
of data, which is challenging for storage and transfer purposes. Compressive
spectral imaging would be a cheaper, more efficient, and well-adapted technique
to perform Earth observation. An interesting architecture is compressive
spectral imaging with diffractive lenses, which is extremely compact. This work
investigates the possibility of replacing the diffractive lens in this system
with a classical refractive lens. Taking advantage of the chromatic aberration
of a lens makes the use of expensive diffractive lenses unnecessary.
Simulations are performed to test the feasibility of the method. Signal
recovery is a basis pursuit solved using the Douglas-Rashford algorithm.

Result: 混合导航显著提高了精度，尤其在静态用户存在时，结合参考站可实现亚米级精度，仅需两颗可见卫星。

Conclusion: 混合PNT系统通过改进误差模型和集成卡尔曼滤波，为月球任务提供了更可靠的导航性能。

Abstract: Accurate positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) are crucial for upcoming
lunar surface missions. Lunar satellite navigation systems are being developed,
but lack coverage during early deployment phases. Hybrid lunar PNT combining
cooperative navigation, satellite systems, and an optional reference station
offers improved accuracy and availability. This study develops realistic error
models that incorporate temporal correlations often ignored in existing works.
We derive a cooperative navigation error model considering fading and
pseudorange bias from multipath propagation, and compare three error models for
lunar satellite pseudorange and pseudorange rate signal-in-space error. These
temporal error correlation models integrate easily into Kalman filters and
provide realistic performance predictions essential for robust navigation
engines. We perform case studies to demonstrate that hybrid navigation
significantly improves accuracy, particularly with static users present. Most
notably, hybrid navigation enables optimal performance when using a lunar
reference station, achieving sub-meter accuracy with only two visible
satellites.

### [12] [Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing with Subcarrier Power-Level Index Modulation for Integrated Sensing and Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10783)
*Murat Temiz,Christos Masouros*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于子载波功率级索引调制（AFDM-PLIM）的AFDM信号技术，用于提升ISAC系统的通信和感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在提高AFDM信号的频谱效率，同时保持所有子载波始终激活，以优化通信和感知性能。

Result: AFDM-PLIM的频谱效率更高，感知性能优于其他AFDM-IM技术，且延迟和多普勒模糊函数表现良好。

Conclusion: AFDM-PLIM在ISAC系统中表现出更高的频谱效率和感知性能，适用于未来通信和感知集成应用。

Abstract: This study proposes an index modulation (IM) technique for affine frequency
division multiplexing (AFDM) signals and examines its communication and sensing
performance toward integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The
power levels of subcarriers are utilized as modulation indices while also
transmitting data symbols within each subcarrier. Thus, the proposed AFDM with
subcarrier power-level index modulation (AFDM-PLIM) maintains all subcarriers
active at all times to achieve a higher spectral efficiency compared to other
AFDM-IM techniques, where some of the subcarriers are turned off for IM. A low
complexity estimator and subcarrier grouping are also proposed to reduce the
computational complexity of the maximum likelihood estimator. Furthermore, this
study also examines the delay and Doppler ambiguity functions of the proposed
AFDM-PLIM and evaluates its range estimation performance. The results show that
its sensing performance is better than AFDM-IM waveforms due to keeping all
subcarriers active at all times.

Method: 利用算法展开将PPG结构先验知识融入深度神经网络，通过卷积稀疏编码模型学习稀疏表示。

Result: 在合成数据集上SNR从-7.07 dB提升至11.23 dB，心率MAE降低55%；在真实数据上MAE降低23%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升PPG信号质量，为心血管疾病监测提供创新工具。

Abstract: Objective. Wearable devices with embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) enable
continuous non-invasive monitoring of cardiac activity, offering a promising
strategy to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. However,
monitoring during daily life introduces motion artifacts that can compromise
the signals. Traditional signal decomposition techniques often fail with severe
artifacts. Deep learning denoisers are more effective but have poorer
interpretability, which is critical for clinical acceptance. This study
proposes a framework that combines the advantages of both signal decomposition
and deep learning approaches. Approach. We leverage algorithm unfolding to
integrate prior knowledge about the PPG structure into a deep neural network,
improving its interpretability. A learned convolutional sparse coding model
encodes the signal into a sparse representation using a learned dictionary of
kernels that capture recurrent morphological patterns. The network is trained
for denoising using the PulseDB dataset and a synthetic motion artifact model
from the literature. Performance is benchmarked with PPG during daily
activities using the PPG-DaLiA dataset and compared with two reference deep
learning methods. Main results. On the synthetic dataset, the proposed method,
on average, improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from -7.07 dB to 11.23 dB
and reduced the heart rate mean absolute error (MAE) by 55%. On the PPG-DaLiA
dataset, the MAE decreased by 23%. The proposed method obtained higher SNR and
comparable MAE to the reference methods. Significance. Our method effectively
enhances the quality of PPG signals from wearable devices and enables the
extraction of meaningful waveform features, which may inspire innovative tools
for monitoring cardiovascular diseases.

Conclusion: 流体天线结合新算法能高效解决DOA估计问题，为无线通信提供灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Fluid antenna (FA) technology has emerged as a promising approach in wireless
communications due to its capability of providing increased degrees of freedom
(DoFs) and exceptional design flexibility. This paper addresses the challenge
of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for aligned received signals (ARS) and
non-aligned received signals (NARS) by designing two specialized uniform FA
structures under time-constrained mobility. For ARS scenarios, we propose a
fully movable antenna configuration that maximizes the virtual array aperture,
whereas for NARS scenarios, we design a structure incorporating a fixed
reference antenna to reliably extract phase information from the signal
covariance. To overcome the limitations of large virtual arrays and limited
sample data inherent in time-varying channels (TVC), we introduce two novel DOA
estimation methods: TMRLS-MUSIC for ARS, combining Toeplitz matrix
reconstruction (TMR) with linear shrinkage (LS) estimation, and TMR-MUSIC for
NARS, utilizing sub-covariance matrices to construct virtual array responses.
Both methods employ Nystrom approximation to significantly reduce computational
complexity while maintaining estimation accuracy. Theoretical analyses and
extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
underdetermined DOA estimation using minimal FA elements, outperform
conventional methods in estimation accuracy, and substantially reduce
computational complexity.

Abstract: This paper investigates a design framework for sparse fluid antenna systems
(FAS) enabling high-performance direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation,
particularly in challenging millimeter-wave (mmWave) environments. By
ingeniously harnessing the mobility of fluid antenna (FA) elements, the

more sources than the number of physical antenna elements. We introduce two
bespoke FA array structures and mobility strategies tailored to scenarios with
aligned and misaligned received signals, respectively, demonstrating a
hardware-driven approach to overcoming complexities typically addressed by
intricate algorithms. A key contribution is a light-of-sight (LoS)-centric,
closed-form DOA estimator, which first employs an eigenvalue-ratio test for
precise LoS path number detection, followed by a polynomial root-finding
procedure. This method distinctly showcases the unique advantages of FAS by
simplifying the estimation process while enhancing accuracy. Numerical results
compellingly verify that the proposed FA array designs and estimation
techniques yield an extended DoF range, deliver superior DOA accuracy, and
maintain robustness across diverse signal conditions.

Abstract: Most existing antenna array-based source localization methods rely on
fixed-position arrays (FPAs) and strict assumptions about source field
conditions (near-field or far-field), which limits their effectiveness in
complex, dynamic real-world scenarios where high-precision localization is
required. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel scalable fluid antenna
system (SFAS) that can dynamically adjust its aperture configuration to
optimize performance for different localization tasks. Within this framework,
we develop a two-stage source localization strategy based on the exact spatial
geometry (ESG) model: the first stage uses a compact aperture configuration for
initial direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, while the second stage employs
an expanded aperture for enhanced DOA and range estimation. The proposed
approach eliminates the traditional need for signal separation or isolation to
classify source types and enables a single SFAS array to achieve high
localization accuracy without field-specific assumptions, model
simplifications, or approximations, representing a new paradigm in array-based
source localization. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method in terms of localization accuracy, computational efficiency,
and robustness to different source types.

Abstract: Air-based molecular communication (MC) has the potential to be one of the
first MC systems to be deployed in real-world applications, enabled by existing
sensor technologies such as metal-oxide semi-conductor (MOS) sensors. However,
commercially available sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive
behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumptions about linear and perfectly
molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this
gap, we propose a detector for molecule mixture communication with a general
non-linear, cross-reactive receiver (RX) array that performs approximate
maximum likelihood detection on the sensor outputs. Additionally, we introduce
an algorithm for the design of mixture alphabets that accounts for the RX
characteristics. We evaluate our detector and alphabet design algorithm through
simulations that are based on measurements reported for two commercial MOS
sensors. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves
similar symbol error rates as data-driven methods without requiring large
numbers of training samples and that the alphabet design algorithm outperforms
methods that do not account for the RX characteristics. Since the proposed
detector and alphabet design algorithm are also applicable to other chemical
sensors, they pave the way for reliable air-based MC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督学习模型在儿童语音任务中的表现，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 使用四种Wav2Vec2变体，结合PFSTAR和CMU Kids数据集进行分层分析，并应用PCA。

Result: Wav2Vec2-large-lv60在CMU Kids上达到97.14%（年龄）和98.20%（性别）准确率，浅层网络表现更优。

Conclusion: 浅层网络更适合捕捉儿童语音特征，为儿童语音接口设计提供优化方向。

Abstract: Children's speech presents challenges for age and gender classification due
to high variability in pitch, articulation, and developmental traits. While
self-supervised learning (SSL) models perform well on adult speech tasks, their
ability to encode speaker traits in children remains underexplored. This paper
presents a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the
PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets. Results show that early layers (1-7) capture
speaker-specific cues more effectively than deeper layers, which increasingly
focus on linguistic information. Applying PCA further improves classification,
reducing redundancy and highlighting the most informative components. The
Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU
Kids; base-100h and large-lv60 models reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR. These
results reveal how speaker traits are structured across SSL model depth and
support more targeted, adaptive strategies for child-aware speech interfaces.

Conclusion: 帧级自动语音质量评估是可行的，且性能优于人工标注，为语音合成系统的评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: While automatic subjective speech quality assessment has witnessed much
progress, an open question is whether an automatic quality assessment at frame
resolution is possible. This would be highly desirable, as it adds
explainability to the assessment of speech synthesis systems. Here, we take
first steps towards this goal by identifying issues of existing quality
predictors that prevent sensible frame-level prediction. Further, we define
criteria that a frame-level predictor should fulfill. We also suggest a
chunk-based processing that avoids the impact of a localized distortion on the
score of neighboring frames. Finally, we measure in experiments with localized
artificial distortions the localization performance of a set of frame-level
quality predictors and show that they can outperform detection performance of
human annotations obtained from a crowd-sourced perception experiment.

Motivation: 探索跨话语语音上下文建模方法，以提升ASR系统的性能，并与当前语音基础模型（如Wav2vec2.0-Conformer）竞争。

Method: 研究了四种方法：输入音频特征拼接、跨话语编码器嵌入拼接、跨话语编码器嵌入池化投影，以及首次应用于C-T模型的基于分块的新方法。提出了一种高效的批量训练方案。

Result: 最佳上下文C-T系统在四个任务中显著降低了WER/CER，相对降幅达6.0%、5.4%、2.0%和3.4%。

Conclusion: 跨话语语音上下文建模对提升ASR系统性能具有潜力，尤其在预训练和微调阶段表现突出。

Abstract: This paper investigates four types of cross-utterance speech contexts
modeling approaches for streaming and non-streaming Conformer-Transformer (C-T)
ASR systems: i) input audio feature concatenation; ii) cross-utterance Encoder
embedding concatenation; iii) cross-utterance Encoder embedding pooling
projection; or iv) a novel chunk-based approach applied to C-T models for the
first time. An efficient batch-training scheme is proposed for contextual C-Ts
that uses spliced speech utterances within each minibatch to minimize the
synchronization overhead while preserving the sequential order of
cross-utterance speech contexts. Experiments are conducted on four benchmark
speech datasets across three languages: the English GigaSpeech and Mandarin
Wenetspeech corpora used in contextual C-T models pre-training; and the English
DementiaBank Pitt and Cantonese JCCOCC MoCA elderly speech datasets used in
domain fine-tuning. The best performing contextual C-T systems consistently
outperform their respective baselines using no cross-utterance speech contexts
in pre-training and fine-tuning stages with statistically significant average
word error rate (WER) or character error rate (CER) reductions up to 0.9%,
1.1%, 0.51%, and 0.98% absolute (6.0%, 5.4%, 2.0%, and 3.4% relative) on the
four tasks respectively. Their performance competitiveness against
Wav2vec2.0-Conformer, XLSR-128, and Whisper models highlights the potential
benefit of incorporating cross-utterance speech contexts into current speech
foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR模型广泛应用于各种场景，但其易受对抗攻击影响，可能导致输出被抑制或干扰。研究旨在验证攻击的鲁棒性并探索提高隐蔽性的方法。

Method: 通过放松优化目标（从完全抑制到部分抑制）来降低攻击的感知性，并测试低通滤波器作为防御手段的效果。

Result: 研究发现部分抑制攻击能显著降低感知性，同时低通滤波器可作为有效防御手段。

Conclusion: 通过优化攻击目标和采用低通滤波器，可以提升ASR模型对抗攻击的隐蔽性和防御能力。

Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an
extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the
possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially
suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of
these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility.
We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete
suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the
imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these
attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an
effective defence.

Motivation: 1/f波动广泛存在于多种系统中，但其普遍性缺乏统一的解释机制。

Result: 数值模拟显示两种机制单独或组合均能产生1/f频谱，且在音乐、地震和天体物理数据中验证了其普适性。

Conclusion: 解调是1/f波动的通用路径，为自然和工程系统中的普遍性提供了简单且可扩展的解释。

Abstract: We propose a universal physical mechanism for the emergence of 1/f
fluctuations, observed across a wide range of systems. In particular, we verify
this on acoustic cases. The mechanism is based on amplitude modulation (AM) and
demodulation (DM), where the 1/f spectral law arises not in the raw waveform
but in its demodulated amplitude envelope. Two distinct yet complementary
processes generate the required AM: (i) stochastic synchronization among
oscillators, modeled via an extended Kuramoto framework that captures perpetual
synchronization-desynchronization cycles, and (ii) frequency-selective
resonance, modeled by spectral accumulation of eigenmodes in acoustic or
structural environments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both
mechanisms, acting separately or in combination, robustly produce 1/f spectra
over several decades when DM is applied, and that the classical Kuramoto
critical point is not necessary for their emergence. We demonstrate the
cross-domain relevance of this AM/DM framework through analyses of musical
performances, seismic records, and astrophysical time series, revealing a
common underlying structure. This work establishes demodulation as a general
route to 1/f fluctuations, providing a simple and scalable explanation for its
ubiquity in both natural and engineered systems.
  Keywords: 1/f fluctuation, amplitude modulation, synchronization, resonance,

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of animal sounds, offers a non-invasive method to
monitor ecosystems. Extracting embeddings from audio-pretrained deep learning
(DL) models without fine-tuning has become popular for obtaining bioacoustic
features for tasks. However, a recent benchmark study reveals that while
fine-tuned audio-pretrained VGG and transformer models achieve state-of-the-art
performance in some tasks, they fail in others. This study benchmarks 11 DL
models on the same tasks by reducing their learned embeddings' dimensionality
and evaluating them through clustering. We found that audio-pretrained DL
models 1) without fine-tuning even underperform fine-tuned AlexNet, 2) both
with and without fine-tuning fail to separate the background from labeled
sounds, but ResNet does, and 3) outperform other models when fewer background
sounds are included during fine-tuning. This study underscores the necessity of
fine-tuning audio-pretrained models and checking the embeddings after
fine-tuning. Our codes are available:

Abstract: Scene recognition of audiologically relevant environments is important for
hearing aids; however, it is challenging, in part because of the limitations of
existing datasets. Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or
audiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine
learning models. Deploying these models on resource-constrained edge devices
presents another challenge. Our solution is two-fold: we leverage several open
source datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for scene recognition of
audiologically relevant environments, and introduce YAMNet+, a sound
recognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available
dataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model
comparison. YAMNet+ is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones
connected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with
hearing aid functionality; serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene
recognition. YAMNet+ achieved a mean average precision of 0.83 and accuracy of
0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories of
audiologically relevant environments. We found that applying transfer learning
from the pretrained YAMNet model was essential. We demonstrated real-time
sound-based scene recognition capabilities on edge devices by deploying YAMNet+
to an Android smartphone. Even with a Google Pixel 3 (a phone with modest
specifications, released in 2018), the model processes audio with approximately
50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms
per 1 second of audio. Our website and code

Result: 实验表明，零样本多说话者TTS模型能显著减少发音错误，保持高说话者保真度和韵律自然性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了构音障碍患者语音合成的挑战，提升了合成语音的质量。

Abstract: Dysarthric speakers experience substantial communication challenges due to
impaired motor control of the speech apparatus, which leads to reduced speech
intelligibility. This creates significant obstacles in dataset curation since
actual recording of long, articulate sentences for the objective of training
personalized TTS models becomes infeasible. Thus, the limited availability of
audio data, in addition to the articulation errors that are present within the
audio, complicates personalized speech synthesis for target dysarthric speaker
adaptation. To address this, we frame the issue as a domain transfer task and
introduce a knowledge anchoring framework that leverages a teacher-student
model, enhanced by curriculum learning through audio augmentation. Experimental
results show that the proposed zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model effectively
generates synthetic speech with markedly reduced articulation errors and high
speaker fidelity, while maintaining prosodic naturalness.

Conclusion: 交替使用语音增强模型和PuttNet能有效减少伪影，提升语音质量，优于单独重复使用任一模型。

Abstract: Speech enhancement using artificial neural networks aims to remove noise from
noisy speech signals while preserving the speech content. However, speech
enhancement networks often introduce distortions to the speech signal, referred
to as artifacts, which can degrade audio quality. In this work, we propose a
post-processing neural network designed to mitigate artifacts introduced by
speech enhancement models. Inspired by the analogy of making a `Putt' after an
`Approach' in golf, we name our model PuttNet. We demonstrate that alternating
between a speech enhancement model and the proposed Putt model leads to
improved speech quality, as measured by perceptual quality scores (PESQ),
objective intelligibility (STOI), and background noise intrusiveness (CBAK)
scores. Furthermore, we illustrate with graphical analysis why this alternating
Approach outperforms repeated application of either model alone.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technology has led to the
widespread proliferation of deepfake speech across social media platforms.
While deepfake audio countermeasures (CMs) achieve promising results on public

To advance CMs for real-world deepfake detection, we first propose the Fake
Speech Wild (FSW) dataset, which includes 254 hours of real and deepfake audio
from four different media platforms, focusing on social media. As CMs, we
establish a benchmark using public datasets and advanced selfsupervised
learning (SSL)-based CMs to evaluate current CMs in real-world scenarios. We
also assess the effectiveness of data augmentation strategies in enhancing CM
robustness for detecting deepfake speech on social media. Finally, by
augmenting public datasets and incorporating the FSW training set, we
significantly advanced real-world deepfake audio detection performance,
achieving an average equal error rate (EER) of 3.54% across all evaluation

Abstract: The field of speech separation, addressing the "cocktail party problem", has
seen revolutionary advances with DNNs. Speech separation enhances clarity in
complex acoustic environments and serves as crucial pre-processing for speech
recognition and speaker recognition. However, current literature focuses
narrowly on specific architectures or isolated approaches, creating fragmented
understanding. This survey addresses this gap by providing systematic
examination of DNN-based speech separation techniques. Our work differentiates
itself through: (I) Comprehensive perspective: We systematically investigate
learning paradigms, separation scenarios with known/unknown speakers,
comparative analysis of supervised/self-supervised/unsupervised frameworks, and
architectural components from encoders to estimation strategies. (II)
Timeliness: Coverage of cutting-edge developments ensures access to current
innovations and benchmarks. (III) Unique insights: Beyond summarization, we
evaluate technological trajectories, identify emerging patterns, and highlight
promising directions including domain-robust frameworks, efficient
architectures, multimodal integration, and novel self-supervised paradigms.
(IV) Fair evaluation: We provide quantitative evaluations on standard datasets,
revealing true capabilities and limitations of different methods. This
comprehensive survey serves as an accessible reference for experienced
researchers and newcomers navigating speech separation's complex landscape.

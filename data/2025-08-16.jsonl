While\nself-supervised learning (SSL) models perform well on adult speech tasks, their\nability to encode speaker traits in children remains underexplored. This paper\npresents a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the\nPFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets. Results show that early layers (1-7) capture\nspeaker-specific cues more effectively than deeper layers, which increasingly\nfocus on linguistic information. Applying PCA further improves classification,\nreducing redundancy and highlighting the most informative components. The\nWav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU\nKids; base-100h and large-lv60 models reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR.

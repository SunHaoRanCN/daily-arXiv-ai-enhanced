Many\ntasks in this field, such as species, individual, and behavior classification\nand detection, are well-suited to machine learning. However, they often suffer\nfrom limited annotated data, highlighting the need for a general-purpose\nbioacoustic encoder capable of extracting useful representations for diverse\ndownstream tasks. Such encoders have been proposed before, but are often\nlimited in scope due to a focus on a narrow range of species (typically birds),\nand a reliance on a single model architecture or training paradigm. Moreover,\nthey are usually evaluated on a small set of tasks and datasets. In this work,\nwe present a large-scale empirical study that covers aspects of bioacoustics\nthat are relevant to research but have previously been scarcely considered:\ntraining data diversity and scale, model architectures and training recipes,\nand the breadth of evaluation tasks and datasets.

To solve the above problems,\nwe propose an optimization method based on domain adversarial transfer learning\nto fine-grained alignment of affective features, named Maximum classifier\ndiscrepancy with Pairwise Learning (McdPL) framework. In McdPL, we design a\ndual adversarial classifier (Ada classifier and RMS classifier), and apply a\nthree-stage adversarial training to maximize classification discrepancy and\nminimize feature distribution to align controversy samples near the decision\nboundary. In the process of domain adversarial training, the two classifiers\nalso maintain an adversarial relationship, ultimately enabling precise\ncross-corpus feature alignment.

As a core component of\nthese networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have witnessed rapid growth in\nrecent years. However, due to the lag in traditional industry regulatory norms,\nunauthorized flight incidents occur frequently, posing a severe security threat\nto LA-ISAC networks. To surveil the non-cooperative UAVs, in this paper, we\npropose a multi-domain supervised contrastive learning (MD-SupContrast)\nframework for UAV radio frequency (RF) open-set recognition. Specifically,\nfirst, the texture features and the time-frequency position features from the\nResNet and the TransformerEncoder are fused, and then the supervised\ncontrastive learning is applied to optimize the feature representation of the\nclosed-set samples. Next, to surveil the invasive UAVs that appear in real\nlife, we propose an improved generative OpenMax (IG-OpenMax) algorithm and\nconstruct an open-set recognition model, namely Open-RFNet. According to the\nunknown samples, we first freeze the feature extraction layers and then only\nretrain the classification layer, which achieves excellent recognition\nperformance both in closed-set and open-set recognitions. We analyze the\ncomputational complexity of the proposed model. Experiments are conducted with\na large-scale UAV open dataset. The results show that the proposed Open-RFNet\noutperforms the existing benchmark methods in terms of recognition accuracy\nbetween the known and the unknown UAVs, as it achieves 95.12% in closed-set and\n96.08% in open-set under 25 UAV types, respectively."}

A major problem for UAV RC links is that\ninterference sources within the coverage may degrade the link quality.

As a result, lost hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)\nindicators (ACK/NACK) feedback in the uplink (UL, RC to UAV) may degrade the\ndownlink (DL, UAV to RC) throughput.

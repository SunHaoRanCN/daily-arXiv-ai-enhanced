In this region, unlike in the far\nfield, the wavefront is nonplanar, which provides additional degrees of freedom\nto shape and steer the transmitted beam in a desired manner. In this paper, we\nfocus on Airy beams, which may exhibit several highly desirable properties in\nthe near-field region. Ideally, these beams follow self-accelerating (curved)\ntrajectories, demonstrate resilience to perturbations through self-healing, and\nmaintain a consistent intensity profile across all planes perpendicular to the\npropagation direction, making them effectively diffraction-free. Specifically,\nwe first present the underlying principles of self-accelerating beams radiated\nby continuous aperture field distributions. We then address several challenges\nregarding the generation of Airy beams, including their exponential decay due\nto finite energy constraints and spatial truncation of the aperture. Moreover,\nwe examine their free-space propagation characteristics. The second part of the\npaper focuses on the propagation behavior of Airy beams in non-line-of-sight\n(NLoS) scenarios. A comparison is also presented between Airy beams and\nGaussian beams. Our theoretical and numerical results show that Airy beams may\noffer a performance advantage over Gaussian beams in certain NLoS channels,\nprovided that their key properties are largely preserved, specifically,\nself-acceleration along a parabolic trajectory and diffraction-free\npropagation. In the presence of an obstacle, this requires that the portion of\nthe transmit aperture with a clear line-of-sight to the receiver is\nsufficiently large."}

This paper\ninvestigates a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output system that\nsimultaneously supports both transmission types, with multicast serving\nmultiple groups. Exact closed-form expressions for the achievable downlink\nspectral efficiency (SE) of both unicast and multicast users are derived for\nzero-forcing and maximum ratio precoding designs.

However, to fully\ncapitalize on the potential of CF-ISAC, accurate time synchronization (TS)\nbetween access points (APs) is critical. Due to the limitations of current\nsynchronization technologies, TS errors have become a significant challenge in\nthe development of the CF-ISAC system. In this paper, we propose a novel\nCF-ISAC architecture based on movable antennas (MAs), which exploits spatial\ndiversity to enhance communication rates, maintain sensing accuracy, and reduce\nthe impact of TS errors. We formulate a worst-case sensing accuracy\noptimization problem for TS errors to address this challenge, deriving the\nworst-case Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Subsequently, we develop a joint\noptimization framework for AP beamforming and MA positions to satisfy\ncommunication rate constraints while improving sensing accuracy. A robust\noptimization framework is designed for the highly complex and non-convex\nproblem.

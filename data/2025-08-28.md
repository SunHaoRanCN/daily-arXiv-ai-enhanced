Abstract: Background: Depression is a major public health concern, affecting an
estimated five percent of the global population. Early and accurate diagnosis
is essential to initiate effective treatment, yet recognition remains
challenging in many clinical contexts. Speech, language, and behavioral cues
collected during patient interviews may provide objective markers that support
clinical assessment.
  Methods: We developed a diagnostic approach that integrates features derived
from patient interviews, including speech patterns, linguistic characteristics,
and structured clinical information. Separate models were trained for each
modality and subsequently combined through multimodal fusion to reflect the
complexity of real-world psychiatric assessment. Model validity was assessed
with established performance metrics, and further evaluated using calibration
and decision-analytic approaches to estimate potential clinical utility.
  Results: The multimodal model achieved superior diagnostic accuracy compared
to single-modality models, with an AUROC of 0.88 and an F1-score of 0.75.
Importantly, the fused model demonstrated good calibration and offered higher
net clinical benefit compared to baseline strategies, highlighting its
potential to assist clinicians in identifying patients with depression more
reliably.
  Conclusion: Multimodal analysis of patient interviews using machine learning
may serve as a valuable adjunct to psychiatric evaluation. By combining speech,
language, and clinical features, this approach provides a robust framework that
could enhance early detection of depressive disorders and support
evidence-based decision-making in mental healthcare.

### [2] [1-Bit Unlimited Sampling Beyond Fourier Domain: Low-Resolution Sampling of Quantization Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19408)

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法相比现有时域技术具有更低的过采样要求和更强的鲁棒性，为1位采样系统的广泛推广奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究成功扩展了1位采样技术的应用范围，通过变换域方法有效解决了传统ADC的性能限制问题，为低功耗高精度信号采集提供了新途径。

Abstract: Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) play a critical role in digital signal
acquisition across various applications, but their performance is inherently
constrained by sampling rates and bit budgets. This bit budget imposes a
trade-off between dynamic range (DR) and digital resolution, with ADC energy
consumption scaling linearly with sampling rate and exponentially with bit
depth. To bypass this, numerous approaches, including oversampling with
low-resolution ADCs, have been explored. A prominent example is 1-Bit ADCs with
Sigma-Delta Quantization (SDQ), a widely used consumer-grade solution. However,
SDQs suffer from overloading or saturation issues, limiting their ability to
handle inputs with arbitrary DR. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF)
addresses this challenge by injecting modulo non-linearity in hardware,
resulting in a new digital sensing technology. In this paper, we introduce a
novel 1-Bit sampling architecture that extends both conventional 1-Bit SDQ and
USF. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We generalize the concept of noise
shaping beyond the Fourier domain, allowing the inclusion of non-bandlimited
signals in the Fourier domain but bandlimited in alternative transform domains.
(2) Building on this generalization, we develop a new transform-domain recovery
method for 1-Bit USF. When applied to the Fourier domain, our method
demonstrates superior performance compared to existing time-domain techniques,
offering reduced oversampling requirements and improved robustness. Extensive
numerical experiments validate our findings, laying the groundwork for a
broader generalization of 1-Bit sampling systems.

Abstract: Carrier Aggregation (CA) is a technique used in 5G and previous cellular
generations to temporarily increase the data rate of a specific user during
peak demand periods or to reduce carrier congestion. CA is achieved by
combining two or more carriers and providing a virtual, wider overall bandwidth
to high-demand users of the system. CA was introduced in the 4G/LTE wireless
era and has been proven effective in 5G as well, where it is said to play a
significant role in efficient network capacity management. Given this success,
the satellite communication (SatCom) community has put its attention into CA
and the potential benefits it can bring in terms of better spectrum utilization
and better meeting the user traffic demand. While the theoretical evaluation of
CA for SatCom has already been presented in several works, this article
presents the design and results obtained with an experimentation testbed based
on Software Defined Radio (SDR) and a satellite channel emulator. We first
present the detailed implementation design, which includes a Gateway (GW)
module responsible for PDU-scheduling across the aggregated carriers, and a
User Terminal (UT) module responsible for aggregating the multiple received
streams. The second part of the article presents the experimental evaluation,
including CA over a single Geostationary (GEO) satellite, CA over a single
Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite, and CA combining carriers sent over GEO and
MEO satellites. A key contribution of this work is the explicit consideration
of multi-orbit scenarios in the testbed design and validation. The testing
results show promising benefits of CA over SatCom systems, motivating potential
upcoming testing on over-the-air systems.

### [4] [Fourth-Order Hierarchical Array: A Novel Scheme for Sparse Array Design Based on Fourth-Order Difference Co-Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19522)
*Si Wang,Guoqiang Xiao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于不同四阶差联合阵列形式的新型四阶分层阵列设计方法，在考虑互耦效应的同时增加自由度并降低冗余度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于单一四阶差联合阵列形式的阵列设计限制了可获得的自由度，且忽略了物理传感器间互耦的影响

Method: 使用任意生成器集构建基于不同四阶差联合阵列形式的四阶分层阵列，推导生成器耦合泄漏与最终阵列的解析关系，提供闭式传感器布放方案

Conclusion: 数值仿真验证了四阶分层阵列在DOA估计性能上优于其他稀疏线性阵列，提供了增强的自由度和抗互耦鲁棒性

Abstract: Conventional array designs based on circular fourth-order cumulant typically
adopt a single expression form of the fourth-order difference co-array (FODCA),
which limits the achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs) and neglects the impact
of mutual coupling among physical sensors. To address above issues, this paper
proposes a novel scheme to design arrays with increased DOFs by combining
different forms of FODCA while accounting for mutual coupling. A novel
fourth-order hierarchical array (FOHA) based on different forms of FODCA is
constructed using an arbitrary generator set. The analytical expression between
the coupling leakage of the generator and the resulting FOHA is derived. Two
specific FOHA configurations are presented with closed-form sensor placements.
The arrays not only offer increased DOFs for resolving more sources in
direction of-arrival (DOA) estimation but also effectively suppress mutual
coupling. Moreover, the redundancy of FODCA is examined, and it is shown that
arrays based on the proposed scheme achieve lower redundancy compared to
existing arrays based on FODCA. Meanwhile, the necessary and sufficient
conditions for signal reconstruction by FOHA are derived. Compared with
existing arrays based on FODCA, the proposed arrays provide enhanced DOFs and
improved robustness against mutual coupling. Numerical simulations verify that
FOHAs achieve superior DOA estimation performance compared with other sparse
linear arrays.

### [5] [Pinching Antenna System for Integrated Sensing and Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19540)
*Haochen Li,Ruikang Zhong,Jiayi Lei,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多波导夹持天线系统的集成感知与通信系统，通过交替优化方法联合优化数字波束成形和夹持波束成形，在满足通信质量约束下最小化目标感知的克拉美罗界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夹持天线系统具有灵活部署和减少信号传播损耗的优势，可以提升集成感知与通信系统的性能。传统MIMO-ISAC系统在严格通信约束下性能受限，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 采用交替优化方法，将问题分解为数字波束成形子问题和夹持波束成形子问题。数字波束成形使用半定松弛技术优化感知协方差矩阵和通信波束成形矩阵，夹持波束成形使用逐次凸近似、惩罚方法和逐元素优化来更新天线部署。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的PASS辅助ISAC框架相比基准方案具有优越性能，受严格通信约束的影响小于传统MIMO-ISAC，且随着波导数量和每个波导上夹持天线数量的增加而获得进一步性能提升。

Conclusion: 多波导夹持天线系统为集成感知与通信提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过联合优化数字和夹持波束成形，能够在保证通信质量的同时显著提升感知性能。

Abstract: Recently, the pinching antenna system (PASS) has attracted considerable
attention due to their advantages in flexible deployment and reduction of
signal propagation loss. In this work, a multiple waveguide PASS assisted
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is proposed, where the base
station (BS) is equipped with transmitting pinching antennas (PAs) and
receiving uniform linear array (ULA) antennas. The full-duplex (FD) BS
transmits the communication and sensing signals through the PAs on waveguides
and collects the echo sensing signals with the mounted ULA. Based on this
configuration, a target sensing Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) minimization problem is
formulated under communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, power
budget constraint, and PA deployment constraints. The alternating optimization
(AO) method is employed to address the formulated non-convex optimization
problem. In each iteration, the overall optimization problem is decomposed into
a digital beamforming sub-problem and a pinching beamforming sub-problem. The
sensing covariance matrix and communication beamforming matrix at the BS are
optimized by solving the digital beamforming sub-problem with semidefinite
relaxation (SDR). The PA deployment is updated by solving the pinching
beamforming sub-problem with the successive convex approximation (SCA) method,
penalty method, and element-wise optimization. Simulation results show that the
proposed PASS assisted ISAC framework achieves superior performance over
benchmark schemes, is less affected by stringent communication constraints
compared to conventional MIMO-ISAC, and benefits further from increasing the
number of waveguides and PAs per waveguide.

Abstract: The development of Large AI Models (LAMs) for wireless communications,
particularly for complex tasks like spectrum sensing, is critically dependent
on the availability of vast, diverse, and realistic datasets. Addressing this
need, this paper introduces the ChangShuoRadioData (CSRD) framework, an
open-source, modular simulation platform designed for generating large-scale
synthetic radio frequency (RF) data. CSRD simulates the end-to-end transmission
and reception process, incorporating an extensive range of modulation schemes
(100 types, including analog, digital, OFDM, and OTFS), configurable channel
models featuring both statistical fading and site-specific ray tracing using
OpenStreetMap data, and detailed modeling of realistic RF front-end impairments
for various antenna configurations (SISO/MISO/MIMO). Using this framework, we
characterize CSRD2025, a substantial dataset benchmark comprising over
25,000,000 frames (approx. 200TB), which is approximately 10,000 times larger
than the widely used RML2018 dataset. CSRD2025 offers unprecedented signal
diversity and complexity, specifically engineered to bridge the Sim2Real gap.
Furthermore, we provide processing pipelines to convert IQ data into
spectrograms annotated in COCO format, facilitating object detection approaches
for time-frequency signal analysis. The dataset specification includes
standardized 8:1:1 training, validation, and test splits (via frame indices) to
ensure reproducible research. The CSRD framework is released at
https://github.com/Singingkettle/ChangShuoRadioData to accelerate the
advancement of AI-driven spectrum sensing and management.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度强化学习和脉冲神经网络的能源效率高的数据流调度方案，用于V2X网络中的感通一体化集成感知与通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决V2X网络中动态环境的不确定性和高能耗问题，减少常规方案对频繁导频传输和频渡通信道状态信息获取的依赖。

Result: 模拟结果证实该方案能够实现显著的能源节省和优秀的通信性能，同时保证感知准确性。

Conclusion: 该方案具有支持未来V2X系统实现绿色和可持续连接的潜力。

Abstract: This work proposes an energy-efficient, learning-based beamforming scheme for
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled V2X networks. Specifically,
we first model the dynamic and uncertain nature of V2X environments as a Markov
Decision Process. This formulation allows the roadside unit to generate
beamforming decisions based solely on current sensing information, thereby
eliminating the need for frequent pilot transmissions and extensive channel
state information acquisition. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithm to jointly optimize beamforming and power allocation, ensuring
both communication throughput and sensing accuracy in highly dynamic scenario.
To address the high energy demands of conventional learning-based schemes, we
embed spiking neural networks (SNNs) into the DRL framework. Leveraging their
event-driven and sparsely activated architecture, SNNs significantly enhance
energy efficiency while maintaining robust performance. Simulation results
confirm that the proposed method achieves substantial energy savings and
superior communication performance, demonstrating its potential to support
green and sustainable connectivity in future V2X systems.

Conclusion: 该方法在解码可靠性咄复杂度之间提供了优异的平表，是下一代URLLC系统的有前景解决方案

Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand high-performance
error-correcting codes and decoders in the finite blocklength regime. This
letter introduces a novel two-stage near-maximum likelihood (near-ML) decoding
framework applicable to any linear block code. Our approach first employs a
low-complexity initial decoder. If this initial stage fails a cyclic redundancy
check, it triggers a second stage: the proposed code-weight sphere decoding
(WSD). WSD iteratively refines the codeword estimate by exploring a localized
sphere of candidates constructed from pre-computed low-weight codewords. This
strategy adaptively minimizes computational overhead at high signal-to-noise
ratios while achieving near-ML performance, especially for low-rate codes.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that our two-stage decoder provides an
excellent trade-off between decoding reliability and complexity, establishing
it as a promising solution for next-generation URLLC systems.

Abstract: Flexible Electronics (FE) offer a promising alternative to rigid
silicon-based hardware for wearable healthcare devices, enabling lightweight,
conformable, and low-cost systems. However, their limited integration density
and large feature sizes impose strict area and power constraints, making
ML-based healthcare systems-integrating analog frontend, feature extraction and
classifier-particularly challenging. Existing FE solutions often neglect
potential system-wide solutions and focus on the classifier, overlooking the
substantial hardware cost of feature extraction and Analog-to-Digital
Converters (ADCs)-both major contributors to area and power consumption. In
this work, we present a holistic mixed-signal feature-to-classifier co-design
framework for flexible smart wearable systems. To the best of our knowledge, we
design the first analog feature extractors in FE, significantly reducing
feature extraction cost. We further propose an hardware-aware NAS-inspired
feature selection strategy within ML training, enabling efficient,
application-specific designs. Our evaluation on healthcare benchmarks shows our
approach delivers highly accurate, ultra-area-efficient flexible systems-ideal
for disposable, low-power wearable monitoring.

Abstract: The use of communication satellites in medium Earth orbit (MEO) is foreseen
to provide quasi-global broadband Internet connectivity in the coming
networking ecosystems. Multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO)
digital signal processing techniques, such as precoding, emerge as appealing
technological enablers in the forward link of multi-beam satellite systems
operating in full frequency reuse (FFR). However, the orbit dynamics of MEO
satellites pose additional challenges that must be carefully evaluated and
addressed. This work presents the design of an in-lab testbed based on
software-defined radio (SDR) platforms and the corresponding adaptations
required for efficient precoding in a MEO scenario. The setup incorporates a
precise orbit model and the radiation pattern of a custom-designed direct
radiating array (DRA). We analyze the main impairments affecting precoding
performance, including Doppler shifts and payload phase noise, and propose a
synchronization loop to mitigate these effects. Preliminary experimental
results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Abstract: Printed electronics offer a promising alternative for applications beyond
silicon-based systems, requiring properties like flexibility, stretchability,

Abstract: Recently, bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), a biological material produced by
non-pathogenic bacteria that possesses excellent material properties for
various medical applications, has received increased interest as a carrier
system for drug delivery. However, the vast majority of existing studies on
drug release from BNC are feasibility studies with modeling and design aspects
remaining largely unexplored. To narrow this research gap, this paper proposes
a novel model for the drug release from BNC. Specifically, the drug delivery
system considered in this paper consists of a BNC fleece coated with a polymer.
The polymer coating is used as an additional diffusion barrier, enabling the
controlled release of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The proposed
physics-based model reflects the geometry of the BNC and incorporates the
impact of the polymer coating on the drug release. Hence, it can be useful for
designing BNC-based drug delivery systems in the future. The accuracy of the
model is validated with experimental data obtained in wet lab experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the generalized problem that minimizes or maximizes a
multi-order complex quadratic form with constant-modulus constraints on all
elements of its optimization variable. Such a mathematical problem is commonly
encountered in various applications of signal processing. We term it as the
constant-modulus multi-order complex quadratic programming (CMCQP) in this
paper. In general, the CMCQP is non-convex and difficult to solve. Its
objective function typically relates to metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio,
Cram\'er-Rao bound, integrated sidelobe level, etc., and constraints normally
correspond to requirements on similarity to desired aspects,
peak-to-average-power ratio, or constant-modulus property in practical
scenarios. In order to find efficient solutions to the CMCQP, we first
reformulate it into an unconstrained optimization problem with respect to phase
values of the studied variable only. Then, we devise a steepest descent/ascent
method with fast determinations on its optimal step sizes. Specifically, we
convert the step-size searching problem into a polynomial form that leads to
closed-form solutions of high accuracy, wherein the third-order Taylor
expansion of the search function is conducted. Our major contributions also lie
in investigating the effect of the order and specific form of matrices embedded
in the CMCQP, for which two representative cases are identified. Examples of
related applications associated with the two cases are also provided for
completeness. The proposed methods are summarized into algorithms, whose
convergence speeds are verified to be fast by comprehensive simulations and
comparisons to existing methods. The accuracy of our proposed fast step-size

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的端到端优化方案在所有研究的符号速率和传输距离下都能提供更好的性能，同时使用更低的调制射频功率、更少的滤波器抽头和更小的信号带宽。

Conclusion: 基于数据驱动代理模型的端到端优化方法能够有效解决DML系统的非线性优化问题，在性能和资源效率方面均优于传统的线性/非线性接收端均衡方案。

Abstract: Directly modulated lasers (DMLs) are an attractive technology for short-reach
intensity modulation and direct detection communication systems. However, their
complex nonlinear dynamics make the modeling and optimization of DML-based
systems challenging. In this paper, we study the end-to-end optimization of
DML-based systems based on a data-driven surrogate model trained on
experimental data. The end-to-end optimization includes the pulse shaping and
equalizer filters, the bias current and the modulation radio-frequency (RF)
power applied to the laser. The performance of the end-to-end optimization
scheme is tested on the experimental setup and compared to 4 different
benchmark schemes based on linear and nonlinear receiver-side equalization. The
results show that the proposed end-to-end scheme is able to deliver better
performance throughout the studied symbol rates and transmission distances
while employing lower modulation RF power, fewer filter taps and utilizing a
smaller signal bandwidth.

Result: 数值结果表明该方法具有高检测概率，且随着用户数量增加仍能保持良好性能

Conclusion: 所提出的无蜂窝大规模MIMO物理层认证框架能够有效实现多用户同时认证，对主动冒充攻击具有强鲁棒性

Abstract: In this paper, we exploit the cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) architecture to design a physical-layer
authentication (PLA) framework that can simultaneously authenticate multiple
distributed users across the coverage area. Our proposed scheme remains
effective even in the presence of active adversaries attempting impersonation
attacks to disrupt the authentication process. Specifically, we introduce a
tag-based PLA CFmMIMO system, wherein the access points (APs) first estimate
their channels with the legitimate users during an uplink training phase.
Subsequently, a unique secret key is generated and securely shared between each
user and the APs. We then formulate a hypothesis testing problem and derive a
closed-form expression for the probability of detection for each user in the
network. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
demonstrating that it maintains a high detection probability even as the number
of users in the system increases.

Motivation: 在强噪声背景下，传统助听器的语音增强效果有限，需要利用音频和视觉模态的互补信息来提升语音可懂度和用户体验

Method: 采用轻量级跨注意力模型学习鲁棒的音频-视觉表征，通过特征对齐模块实现多模态特征同步，集成到AVSE框架中动态强调关键特征

Conclusion: 该轻量级跨注意力模型有效实现了音频-视觉特征同步，在保持实时处理能力的同时显著提升了助听器的噪声抑制性能和语音可懂度

Abstract: Audio-visual feature synchronization for real-time speech enhancement in
hearing aids represents a progressive approach to improving speech
intelligibility and user experience, particularly in strong noisy backgrounds.
This approach integrates auditory signals with visual cues, utilizing the
complementary description of these modalities to improve speech
intelligibility. Audio-visual feature synchronization for real-time SE in
hearing aids can be further optimized using an efficient feature alignment
module. In this study, a lightweight cross-attentional model learns robust
audio-visual representations by exploiting large-scale data and simple
architecture. By incorporating the lightweight cross-attentional model in an
AVSE framework, the neural system dynamically emphasizes critical features
across audio and visual modalities, enabling defined synchronization and
improved speech intelligibility. The proposed AVSE model not only ensures high
performance in noise suppression and feature alignment but also achieves
real-time processing with minimal latency (36ms) and energy consumption.
Evaluations on the AVSEC3 dataset show the efficiency of the model, achieving
significant gains over baselines in perceptual quality (PESQ:0.52),
intelligibility (STOI:19\%), and fidelity (SI-SDR:10.10dB).

Conclusion: FLASepformer通过线性注意力机制有效解决了语音分离中的长序列处理问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Speech separation always faces the challenge of handling prolonged time
sequences. Past methods try to reduce sequence lengths and use the Transformer
to capture global information. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of
the attention module, memory usage and inference time still increase
significantly with longer segments. To tackle this, we introduce Focused Linear
Attention and build FLASepformer with linear complexity for efficient speech
separation. Inspired by SepReformer and TF-Locoformer, we have two variants:
FLA-SepReformer and FLA-TFLocoformer. We also add a new Gated module to improve
performance further. Experimental results on various datasets show that
FLASepformer matches state-of-the-art performance with less memory consumption
and faster inference. FLA-SepReformer-T/B/L increases speed by 2.29x, 1.91x,
and 1.49x, with 15.8%, 20.9%, and 31.9% GPU memory usage, proving our model's

Motivation: 目标语音提取在噪声多讲者场景中性能不佳，需要更好地处理噪声干扰和语音失真问题。

Method: 基于SEF-PNet框架，提出LGTSE和D-LGTSE方法：LGTSE通过去噪后再与注册语音交互减少噪声干扰；D-LGTSE利用去噪语音作为训练输入提高模型强健性。采用两阶段训练策略：GTCRN增强导向预训练+聚合精调。

Result: 在Libri2Mix数据集上实验显示显著改善：SISDR提升0.89dB，PESQ提升0.16，STOI提升1.97%，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过语音增强模型导向的方法有效提升了噪声多讲者场景下的目标语音提取性能，为复杂环境中的语音分离提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Target speech extraction (TSE) has achieved strong performance in relatively
simple conditions such as one-speaker-plus-noise and two-speaker mixtures, but
its performance remains unsatisfactory in noisy multi-speaker scenarios. To
address this issue, we introduce a lightweight speech enhancement model, GTCRN,
to better guide TSE in noisy environments. Building on our competitive previous
speaker embedding/encoder-free framework SEF-PNet, we propose two extensions:
LGTSE and D-LGTSE. LGTSE incorporates noise-agnostic enrollment guidance by
denoising the input noisy speech before context interaction with enrollment
speech, thereby reducing noise interference. D-LGTSE further improves system
robustness against speech distortion by leveraging denoised speech as an
additional noisy input during training, expanding the dynamic range of noisy
conditions and enabling the model to directly learn from distorted signals.
Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training strategy, first with GTCRN
enhancement-guided pre-training and then joint fine-tuning, to fully exploit
model potential.Experiments on the Libri2Mix dataset demonstrate significant
improvements of 0.89 dB in SISDR, 0.16 in PESQ, and 1.97% in STOI, validating
the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 解决Transformer编码器-解码器模型在推理时因自回归特性和大模型尺寸导致的瓶颈问题，以及重复错误对识别准确率的负面影响

Method: 在预训练编码器基础上附加轻量级快速解码器，推理时快速解码器先生成输出，再由Transformer解码器验证和选择性修正

Result: 在LibriSpeech和GigaSpeech测试集上，仅微调新增解码器即可达到与基线相当或更好的词错误率，同时推理速度提升两倍以上

Conclusion: 混合解码方法有效解决了推理速度瓶颈和重复错误问题，在保持性能的同时显著加速推理过程

Abstract: Recently, Transformer-based encoder-decoder models have demonstrated strong
performance in multilingual speech recognition. However, the decoder's
autoregressive nature and large size introduce significant bottlenecks during
inference. Additionally, although rare, repetition can occur and negatively
affect recognition accuracy. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Hybrid Decoding approach that both accelerates inference and alleviates the
issue of repetition. Our method extends the transformer encoder-decoder
architecture by attaching a lightweight, fast decoder to the pretrained
encoder. During inference, the fast decoder rapidly generates an output, which
is then verified and, if necessary, selectively corrected by the Transformer
decoder. This results in faster decoding and improved robustness against
repetitive errors. Experiments on the LibriSpeech and GigaSpeech test sets
indicate that, with fine-tuning limited to the added decoder, our method
achieves word error rates comparable to or better than the baseline, while more
than doubling the inference speed.

Abstract: Symbolic music generation has seen rapid progress with artificial neural
networks, yet remains underexplored in the biologically plausible domain of
spiking neural networks (SNNs), where both standardized benchmarks and
comprehensive evaluation methods are lacking. To address this gap, we introduce
MuSpike, a unified benchmark and evaluation framework that systematically
assesses five representative SNN architectures (SNN-CNN, SNN-RNN, SNN-LSTM,
SNN-GAN and SNN-Transformer) across five typical datasets, covering tonal,
structural, emotional, and stylistic variations. MuSpike emphasizes
comprehensive evaluation, combining established objective metrics with a
large-scale listening study. We propose new subjective metrics, targeting
musical impression, autobiographical association, and personal preference, that
capture perceptual dimensions often overlooked in prior work. Results reveal
that (1) different SNN models exhibit distinct strengths across evaluation
dimensions; (2) participants with different musical backgrounds exhibit diverse
perceptual patterns, with experts showing greater tolerance toward AI-composed
music; and (3) a noticeable misalignment exists between objective and
subjective evaluations, highlighting the limitations of purely statistical
metrics and underscoring the value of human perceptual judgment in assessing
musical quality. MuSpike provides the first systematic benchmark and systemic
evaluation framework for SNN models in symbolic music generation, establishing
a solid foundation for future research into biologically plausible and
cognitively grounded music generation.

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) is a natural approach for humans to understand a
piece of music audio. However, for machines, accessing a large-scale dataset
covering diverse aspects of music is crucial, yet challenging, due to the
scarcity of publicly available music data of this type. This paper introduces
MQAD, a music QA dataset built on the Million Song Dataset (MSD), encompassing
a rich array of musical features, including beat, chord, key, structure,
instrument, and genre -- across 270,000 tracks, featuring nearly 3 million
diverse questions and captions. MQAD distinguishes itself by offering detailed
time-varying musical information such as chords and sections, enabling
exploration into the inherent structure of music within a song. To compile
MQAD, our methodology leverages specialized Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
models to extract higher-level musical features and Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate natural language QA pairs. Then, we leverage a multimodal
LLM that integrates the LLaMA2 and Whisper architectures, along with novel
subjective metrics to assess the performance of MQAD. In experiments, our model
trained on MQAD demonstrates advancements over conventional music audio

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence in music has made significant strides, yet
it still falls short of the substantial achievements seen in natural language
processing, primarily due to the limited availability of music data.
Knowledge-informed approaches have been shown to enhance the performance of
music generation models, even when only a few pieces of musical knowledge are
integrated. This paper seeks to leverage comprehensive music theory in
AI-driven music generation tasks, such as algorithmic composition and style
transfer, which traditionally require significant manual effort with existing
techniques. We introduce a novel automatic music lexicon construction model
that generates a lexicon, named CompLex, comprising 37,432 items derived from
just 9 manually input category keywords and 5 sentence prompt templates. A new
multi-agent algorithm is proposed to automatically detect and mitigate
hallucinations. CompLex demonstrates impressive performance improvements across
three state-of-the-art text-to-music generation models, encompassing both
symbolic and audio-based methods. Furthermore, we evaluate CompLex in terms of
completeness, accuracy, non-redundancy, and executability, confirming that it
possesses the key characteristics of an effective lexicon.

However, challenges such as limited data and\nthe lack of fine-grained, adaptive feature selection often hinder performance.\nTo address these issues, we propose MoTAS, a robust framework designed to\nenhance AD screening efficiency. MoTAS leverages Text-to-Speech (TTS)\naugmentation to increase data volume and employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE)\nmechanism to improve multimodal feature selection, jointly enhancing model\ngeneralization. The process begins with automatic speech recognition (ASR) to\nobtain accurate transcriptions. TTS is then used to synthesize speech that\nenriches the dataset. After extracting acoustic and text embeddings, the MoE\nmechanism dynamically selects the most informative features, optimizing feature\nfusion for improved classification. Evaluated on the ADReSSo dataset, MoTAS\nachieves a leading accuracy of 85.71\\%, outperforming existing baselines.\nAblation studies further validate the individual contributions of TTS\naugmentation and MoE in boosting classification performance. These findings\nhighlight the practical value of MoTAS in real-world AD screening scenarios,\nparticularly in data-limited settings."}

Despite\nimpressive performance, the implications of curved probability paths are\nunknown. Methods such as Schrodinger bridges focus on curved paths, where\ntime-dependent gradients and variance do not promote straight paths. Findings\nin machine learning research suggest that straight paths, such as conditional\nflow matching, are easier to train and offer better generalisation. In this\npaper we quantify the effect of path straightness on speech enhancement\nquality. We report experiments with the Schrodinger bridge, where we show that\ncertain configurations lead to straighter paths. Conversely, we propose\nindependent conditional flow-matching for speech enhancement, which models\nstraight paths between noisy and clean speech. We demonstrate empirically that\na time-independent variance has a greater effect on sample quality than the\ngradient. Although conditional flow matching improves several speech quality\nmetrics, it requires multiple inference steps.

We focus\non overcoming the limitations of traditional sensing methods by enhancing\nsignal processing techniques to capture subtle physiological changes\neffectively. Our study introduces novel adaptations of the Prony and MUSIC\nalgorithms tailored for real-time heart and respiration rate monitoring,\nsignificantly advancing the accuracy and reliability of non-contact vital sign\nmonitoring using radar technologies. Notably, these algorithms demonstrate a\nrobust ability to suppress noise and harmonic interference. For instance, the\nmean absolute errors (MAE) for MUSIC and Prony in heart rate detection are 1.8\nand 0.81, respectively, while for respiration rate, the MAEs are 1.01 and 0.8,\nrespectively. These results underscore the potential of FMCW radar as a\nreliable, non-invasive solution for continuous vital sign monitoring in\nhealthcare settings, particularly in clinical and emergency scenarios where\ntraditional contact-based monitoring is impractical."}

However, their performance in very low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios remains under-explored and limited, as\nthese conditions pose significant challenges to both discriminative and\ngenerative state-of-the-art methods. To address this, we propose a method that\nleverages latent features extracted from discriminative speech enhancement\nmodels as generic conditioning features to improve GAN-based speech\nenhancement. The proposed method, referred to as DisCoGAN, demonstrates\nperformance improvements over baseline models, particularly in low-SNR\nscenarios, while also maintaining competitive or superior performance in\nhigh-SNR conditions and on real-world recordings. We also conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of conventional GAN-based architectures, including\nGANs trained end-to-end, GANs as a first processing stage, and post-filtering\nGANs, as well as discriminative models under low-SNR conditions. We show that\nDisCoGAN consistently outperforms existing methods.

To\naddress this gap, we introduce the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) to\nevaluate low-level auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal\nvocalizations.

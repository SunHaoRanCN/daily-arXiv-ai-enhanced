Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through\nalgorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which\ndirectly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is\na dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the\nemerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing\n(VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a\ndistinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we\nestablish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing\n(AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each\narithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model\nexploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization\nproblem to strike balance between computing performance and computational\ncomplexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to\nsolve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a\ncase study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary\nbetween computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60%\nsum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared\nto the traditional fixed-length methods."}

Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which\nadjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM\ncharacteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing\nstudies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores\nits application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station\nserves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability\nparadigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired\nbeampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state\nselection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set\nof patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM\nprecoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case\nwe derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM\nprecoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and\npropose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern\nselection.

We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol\ndetection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios\nfor the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED)\nscheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \\emph{virtual} pilots to further\nimprove the CE and data detection accuracy.\n  Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE\nand data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in\nuncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier\nequalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while\nOFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS\nperform similarly, and they outperform OFDM. With coded communications,\ninterestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver\nis employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is\nconstrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel\nconditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these\ndifferences disappear."}

This study introduces WaveLLDM\n(Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an\nefficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and\ndenoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral\ndomain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing\ncomputational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality.

However, their effectiveness deteriorates for\nlow signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge\ndevices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within\nthe limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram\n(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by\nartefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a\nparadigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence\nof filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter\ndesign as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design\nsignal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing\nkey patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong\npotential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as\ndemonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state\nclassification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The\nproposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that\nrequire accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals."}

However,\ndegradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a\nmajor challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio\nrestoration, they typically require significant computational resources and\nstruggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM\n(Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an\nefficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and\ndenoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral\ndomain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing\ncomputational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical\nevaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves\naccurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores\n(0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still\nunderperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual\nquality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and\nSTOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to\nsuboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient\ntraining duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a\nneural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for\nfuture development."}

While recent advancements in self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech,\naccurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This\nstudy investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from\nstate-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT,\nData2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech\nin zero-shot scenarios.

The analysis identified the most effective layers for\nenhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where\nWSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for\ntesting. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model\nachieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64%\nrelative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of\n10.65%).

*Kaixuan Bao,Wei Xu,Xiaohu You,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了算术级可变精度计算(AL-VPC)框架，通过为每个算术运算优化计算精度，在无线通信中平衡计算性能和复杂度，相比传统固定精度方法可提升60%和速率或降低30%复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算复杂度是无线通信中的主要挑战，现有方法多采用算法特定方式降低复杂度，但计算精度这一直接影响计算性能和复杂度的基本维度却很少被探索

Method: 建立算术级可变精度计算统一框架，开发基于随机分析的算术传播误差模型，提出离线VPC和在线VPC两种算法，以零迫预编码为案例进行研究

Result: 揭示了计算性能与复杂度之间的帕累托边界，相比传统固定长度方法可实现高达60%的和速率提升或等效30%的复杂度降低

Conclusion: 可变精度计算为无线通信系统提供了在计算性能和复杂度之间进行权衡的有效方法，内存计算架构的兴起使得这种算术级精度优化成为可能

Abstract: Computational complexity poses a significant challenge in wireless
communication. Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through
algorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which
directly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is
a dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the
emerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing
(VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a
distinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we
establish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing
(AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each
arithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model
exploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization
problem to strike balance between computing performance and computational
complexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to
solve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a
case study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary
between computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60%
sum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared
to the traditional fixed-length methods.

*Alireza Fadakar,Yuchen Zhang,Hui Chen,Musa Furkan Keskin,Henk Wymeersch,Andreas F. Molisch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究电磁可重构流体天线系统(ER-FAS)在下行链路定位中的应用，提出了两种可重构性范式的混合预编码设计，显著提高了用户设备的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要利用ER-FAS提升频谱效率，本文探索其在定位领域的应用潜力，通过动态控制天线单元的电磁特性来实现按需波束成形，从而增强无线链路的功率效率。

Method: 考虑MISO系统，基站配备多天线ER-FAS服务单天线UE。提出两种可重构性范式：合成模型（从有限电磁基函数生成期望波束模式）和有限状态选择模型（从预定义模式集中选择）。针对两种范式分别设计了联合基带和电磁预编码器来最小化UE位置误差界限。

Result: 在合成模型中推导出低维闭式表达的基带和电磁预编码器；在有限状态模型中获得了闭式基带结构并提出了低复杂度块坐标下降算法进行电磁模式选择。分析和仿真表明所提方法显著优于传统不可重构阵列。

Conclusion: 提出的ER-FAS混合设计能够通过动态控制天线电磁特性，有效提升下行链路定位精度，为无线定位系统提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (ER-FAS) introduce
additional degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain by dynamically
steering per-antenna radiation patterns, thereby enhancing power efficiency in
wireless links. Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which
adjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM
characteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing
studies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores
its application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station
serves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability
paradigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired
beampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state
selection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set
of patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM
precoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case
we derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM
precoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and
propose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern
selection. Analytical bounds and extensive simulations show that the proposed
hybrid designs for ER-FAS substantially improve UE positioning accuracy over
traditional non-reconfigurable arrays.

### [3] [Channel Estimation and Data Detection in DS-Spread Channels: A Unified Framework, Novel Algorithms, and Waveform Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21373)
*Niladri Halder,Chandra R. Murthy*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的接收机处理框架，用于水下声学通信中的延迟-缩放通道，包含通用的输入-输出关系、新题迭代变分负网格额估算算法以及低复杂度软符号检测算法，并对OFDM、OTFS、OCDM和ODSS四种调制波形进行了公平综合性能比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下声学通信中存在延迟-缩放扩散通道，需要一个统一的接收机处理框架来处理不同调制波形的频道估计和数据检测，并进行公平的性能比较。

Method: 提出统一的输入-输出关系框架；发展了新题迭代变分负网格额估算算法（FVB和SVB）；设计了低复杂度变分软符号检测算法（VSSD）；建立了数据辅助迭代额估和检测方案（ICED）。

Result: 数值结果显示提出算法在频道估计和数据检测方面有效。在无编码通信中，ODSS性能最佳，OCDM和OTFS次之，OFDM最差；使用VSSD算法时，OTFS、OCDM和ODSS性能相似且都超过OFDM。在编码通信中，所有波形都提供几乎相同的BER。

Conclusion: 当接收机复杂度受限时，波形选择很重要，特别是在严峻的通道条件下；而使用更复杂的接收机算法时，不同波形之间的性能差异会消失。

Abstract: We present a unified receiver processing framework for communication over
delay-scale (DS)-spread channels that arise in underwater acoustic (UWA)
communications that addresses both channel estimation (CE) and data detection
for different modulation waveforms, namely OFDM, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS, through
a common input--output relation. Using this framework, we conduct a fair and
comprehensive comparative study of these waveforms under DS-spread UWA channels
and similar receiver complexities.
  We also develop a novel iterative variational Bayesian (VB) off-grid CE
algorithm to estimate the delay and scale parameters of the channel paths, via
two approaches: a first-order approximation scheme (FVB) and a second-order
approximation scheme (SVB). We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol
detection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios
for the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED)
scheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \emph{virtual} pilots to further
improve the CE and data detection accuracy.
  Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE
and data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in
uncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier
equalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while
OFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS
perform similarly, and they outperform OFDM. With coded communications,
interestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver
is employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is
constrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel
conditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these
differences disappear.

### [4] [Sampling Theory of Jointly Bandlimited Time-vertex Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21412)
*Hang Sheng,Hui Feng,Junhao Yu,Feng Ji,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了时-顶点图信号(TVGS)的临界采样问题，提出了针对连续时间信号、无限长序列和有限长序列三种TVGS类型的采样密度下界，并给出了可实现完美重建的采样与重构方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时-顶点图信号模型用于描述具有不规则结构的时变数据，其联合时-顶点傅里叶谱域的带限特性反映了时间和图拓扑上的平滑性。需要研究如何对这些信号进行临界采样以实现完美重建。

Method: 通过分析联合时-顶点傅里叶谱域的频谱支撑测度，推导了TVGS采样密度或采样率的下界，并针对三种不同类型的TVGS提出了相应的采样和重构程序。

Result: 证明了联合带限TVGS的采样密度下界，该下界依赖于联合谱域的频谱支撑测度，并提供了每个顶点采样集上可实现完美重建的采样密度下界。

Conclusion: 所提出的采样方案能够实现临界采样，并在数值和真实数据集上验证了其有效性，为时-顶点图信号的采样理论提供了理论基础和实用方法。

Abstract: Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with
irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In
this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including
continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences
in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited
TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which
depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or
sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To
demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and
reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how
the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real
datasets.

### [5] [Subset Random Sampling and Reconstruction of Finite Time-Vertex Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21415)
*Hang Sheng,Qinji Shu,Hui Feng,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对有限时间-顶点图信号的子集随机采样方案，通过在选定的行和列子矩阵内进行随机采样，解决了实际应用中采样受限的问题，并提供了高概率重构的理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机采样方法允许在任何顶点和任何时间提取样本，但实际应用中采样通常仅限于顶点的子集和特定时刻，需要更实用的采样策略。

Method: 首先随机选择行和列的子集形成子矩阵，然后在子矩阵内进行随机采样；提出了结合低秩、稀疏性和平滑性先验（LSSP）的重构框架。

Result: 理论分析提供了高概率重构原始信号的充分条件，实验验证了重构的可行性和所提框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的子集随机采样方案能够有效处理实际采样约束下的有限时间-顶点图信号重构问题，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Finite time-vertex graph signals (FTVGS) provide an efficient representation
for capturing spatio-temporal correlations across multiple data sources on
irregular structures. Although sampling and reconstruction of FTVGS with known
spectral support have been extensively studied, the case of unknown spectral
support requires further investigation. Existing random sampling methods may
extract samples from any vertex at any time, but such strategies are not
friendly in practice, where sampling is typically limited to a subset of
vertices and moments. To address this requirement, we propose a subset random
sampling scheme for FTVGS. Specifically, we first randomly select a subset of
rows and columns to form a submatrix, followed by random sampling within that
submatrix. In theory, we provide sufficient conditions for reconstructing the
original FTVGS with high probability. Additionally, we introduce a
reconstruction framework incorporating low-rank, sparsity, and smoothness
priors (LSSP), and verify the feasibility of the reconstruction and the
effectiveness of the framework through experiments.

*Pierluigi Poggiolini,Yanchao Jiang,Yifeng Gao,Fabrizio Forghieri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种叫PCFM的闭式GN/EGN模型，通过多项式描述通道功率分布，实现了高速、高精度的光传输系统模拟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要快速而准确的物理层模型来设计、优化和管理超宽带光传输系统

Method: 将每个通道在光纤段中的空间功率分布表达为多项式，通过分析积分计算实现闭式模型求解

Result: 在包括拉曼增益和通道间拉曼散射的多带(C+L+S)场景中，与数值积分GN模型对比显示出很好的准确性

Conclusion: PCFM模型具有较高的准确度和广泛的适用性，并提供了开源软件实现

Abstract: Ultrafast and accurate physical layer models are essential for designing,
optimizing and managing ultra-wideband optical transmission systems. We present
a closed-form GN/EGN model, named Polynomial Closed-Form Model (PCFM),
improving reliability, accuracy, and generality. The key to deriving PCFM is
expressing the spatial power profile of each channel along a span as a
polynomial. Then, under reasonable approximations, the integral calculation can
be carried out analytically, for any chosen degree of the polynomial. We
present a full detailed derivation of the model. We then validate it vs. the
numerically integrated GN-model in a challenging multiband (C+L+S) scenario,
including Raman amplification and inter-channel Raman scattering. We then show
that the approach works well also in the special case of the presence of
multiple lumped loss along the fiber. Overall, the approach shows very good
accuracy and broad applicability. A software implementing the model, fully
reconfigurable to any type of system layout, is available for download under

### [7] [Energy Detection over Composite $κ-μ$ Shadowed Fading Channels with Inverse Gaussian Distribution in Ultra mMTC Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21614)
*He Huang,Zeping Sui,Zilong Liu,Wei Huang,Md. Noor-A-Rahim,Haishi Wang,Zhiheng Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了6G mMTC网络中κ-μ阴影复合衰落信道下能量检测的特性，首次推导了基于截断方法的平均检测概率闭式表达式，发现传播路径数比平均SNR对检测概率影响更大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究6G超大规模机器类型通信(mMTC)网络中能量检测在复合κ-μ阴影衰落信道下的性能特征，为网络设计提供理论指导

Method: 基于逆高斯分布推导SNR的概率密度函数闭式表达式，采用新颖的积分和数学变换技术，首次推导出截断型平均检测概率闭式表达式

Result: 仿真显示传播路径数比平均SNR对平均检测概率的影响更显著，这与之前针对设备到设备网络的研究结论相反

Conclusion: 6G mMTC网络设计应重点考虑增强发射机-接收机布局和天线对准策略，而非单纯提高设备间平均SNR

Abstract: This paper investigates the characteristics of energy detection (ED) over
composite $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading channels in ultra machine-type
communication (mMTC) networks. We have derived the closed-form expressions of
the probability density function (PDF) of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on
the Inverse Gaussian (\emph{IG}) distribution. By adopting novel integration
and mathematical transformation techniques, we derive a truncation-based
closed-form expression for the average detection probability for the first
time. It can be observed from our simulations that the number of propagation
paths has a more pronounced effect on average detection probability compared to
average SNR, which is in contrast to earlier studies that focus on
device-to-device networks. It suggests that for 6G mMTC network design, we
should consider enhancing transmitter-receiver placement and antenna alignment
strategies, rather than relying solely on increasing the device-to-device
average SNR.

### [8] [On the Deployment of Multiple Radio Stripes for Large-Scale Near-Field RF Wireless Power Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21640)
*Amirhossein Azarbahram,Onel L. A. López,Petar Popovski,Matti Latva-aho*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在室内近场无线电能量传输场景下的无线电系统部署，通过聚类算法和天线元件优化提高热点区域的最小收到功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内无线电能量传输中能源需求集中的热点区域的效率问题，最大化所有热点的最小收到功率。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先根据空间位置和近场传播特性进行聚类分配无线电系统，然后进行天线元件布置优化。提出四种部署算法（SCA、SGP、直线形、正多边形）。

Result: 聚类方法有效收敛，Chebyshev初始化显著优于随机初始化。优化部署方案在广泛频率和系统长度范围内都超过基准方案，多边形布置表现最佳，直线形在高单元收益设置下体现优势。

Conclusion: 该研究为室内无线电能量传输提供了高效的系统部署方案，特别是多边形布置在大多数情况下表现最佳，而直线形布置在特定条件下也有其优势。

Abstract: This paper investigates the deployment of radio stripe systems for indoor
radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) in line-of-sight near-field
scenarios. The focus is on environments where energy demand is concentrated in
specific areas, referred to as 'hotspots', spatial zones with higher user
density or consistent energy requirements. We formulate a joint clustering and
radio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received
power across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem
into two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on
their spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii)
antenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio
stripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex
approximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are
shape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either
straight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical
results show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with
Chebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The
optimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide
range of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped
deployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches. Meanwhile,
the line-shaped deployment demonstrates an advantage under high boresight gain
settings, benefiting from increased spatial diversity and broader angular
coverage.

### [9] [Machine Intelligence on the Edge: Interpretable Cardiac Pattern Localisation Using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21652)
*Haozhe Tian,Qiyu Rao,Nina Moutonnet,Pietro Ferraro,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出序列匹配滤波器(SMF)，用强化学习设计的滤波器序列替代传统单匹配滤波器，解决低信噪比信号中的模式定位问题，在ECG检测中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统匹配滤波器在低信噪比信号(如边缘设备记录的信号)中效果不佳，噪声模式容易与目标信号混淆，特别是在耳部心电图等信号衰减严重的应用中。

Method: 将滤波器设计建模为序列决策过程，使用强化学习代理设计信号特定的滤波器序列，保持完全可解释性。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的真实ECG数据集上实现了最先进的R峰检测和生理状态分类性能。

Conclusion: SMF框架具有可靠和可解释的临床决策支持潜力，可扩展到各种需要从噪声污染信号中准确定位模式的应用场景。

Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high
efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge
devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within
the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram
(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by
artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a
paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence
of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter
design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design
signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing
key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong
potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as
demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state
classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The
proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that
require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动想象脑机接口系统在帮助个体恢复自由方面具有潜力，但脑电图数据的解释仍然是一个复杂且未解决的问题，特别是在左右手运动想象分类方面需要更准确的方法。

Method: 研究开发了一个完整的机器学习管道，为每个受试者训练个体化模型，使用脑电图数据来分类左右手运动想象和休息状态，并与当前最先进的研究进行了离线比较。

Conclusion: 该研究证明所提出的机器学习管道具有高准确性和可靠性，可以有效地应用于运动想象脑机接口系统，为实际应用提供了有力的技术支撑。

Abstract: Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are systems that
detect and interpret brain activity patterns linked to the mental visualization
of movement, and then translate these into instructions for controlling
external robotic or domotic devices. Such devices have the potential to be
useful in a broad variety of applications. While implementing a system that
would help individuals restore some freedom levels, the interpretation of
(Electroencephalography) EEG data remains a complex and unsolved problem. In
the literature, the classification of left and right imagined movements has
been extensively studied. This study introduces a novel pipeline that makes use
of machine learning techniques for classifying MI EEG data. The entire
framework is capable of accurately categorizing left and imagined motions, as
well as rest phases, for a set of 52 subjects who performed a MI task. We
trained a within subject model on each individual subject. The methodology has
been offline evaluated and compared to four studies that are currently the
state-of-the-art regarding the specified dataset. The results show that our
proposed framework could be used with MI-BCI systems in light of its failsafe
classification performances, i.e. 99.5% in accuracy

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言语音识别模型在标准基准测试（如FLEURS、CommonVoice）上的表现不能准确反映其在真实区域方言（如魁北克法语）上的实际性能，需要建立更贴近现实应用的评估方法。

Method: 基于魁北克公共调查对话语料库CommissionsQc构建基准测试和评估流程，从速度、词错误率和语义准确性三个维度评估大型预训练多语言语音识别模型。

Result: 在魁北克法语方言上，大型多语言语音识别模型的性能与在标准基准测试上的表现存在显著差异，现有基准测试结果不能很好地预测在区域方言上的实际表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建面向真实条件和区域语言变体的语音应用提供了重要参考，强调了需要针对特定方言和真实场景进行专门评估的必要性。

Abstract: We evaluate the performance of large pretrained multilingual speech
recognition models on a regional variety of French spoken in Qu\'ebec, Canada,
in terms of speed, word error rate and semantic accuracy. To this end we build
a benchmark and evaluation pipeline based on the CommissionsQc datasets, a
corpus of spontaneous conversations recorded during public inquiries recently
held in Qu\'ebec. Published results for these models on well-known benchmarks
such as FLEURS or CommonVoice are not good predictors of the performance we
observe on CommissionsQC. Our results should be of interest for practitioners
interested in building speech applications for realistic conditions or regional
language varieties.

TL;DR: 研究分析了多种自监督学习模型在儿童语音识别中的层级特征效果，Wav2Vec2模型第22层获得最佳性能，WER相对改善51.64%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 存在语音识别系统在儿童语音处理上的性能缺口，并需要研究自监督学习模型的层级特征在零样本场景下的效果

Method: 提取Wav2Vec2、HuBERT、Data2Vec和WavLM等SSL预训练模型的层级特征，并集成到Kaldi工具集的简化DNN-ASR系统中，在零样本场景下进行测试

Result: Wav2Vec2模型第22层获得最低WER 5.15%，相比直接零样本解码改善51.64%，并在不同年龄段都表现一致性改善，在CMU Kids数据集上也验证了通用性

Conclusion: 通过选择合适的SSL模型层级特征，可以显著提升儿童语音识别的零样本性能，Wav2Vec2模型的深层特征表现特别优异

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately
process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and
linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech,
accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This
study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from
state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT,
Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech
in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these
models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system
using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for
enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where
WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for
testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model
achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64%
relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of
10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent
performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains
observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments
on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the
generalizability of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于自监督学习模型的零样本关键词检测方法，专门处理儿童语音的特殊挑战，在儿童语音数据集上达到了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语音具有独特的音响和语言特征，对传统关键词检测系统构成挑战，需要专门的零样本方法来处理。

Method: 利用Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和Data2Vec等先进自监督学习模型进行层级特征提取，训练Kaldi基于DNN的KWS系统，在成人语音数据上训练后直接测试儿童语音。

Result: 在PFSTAR儿童语音数据集上获得最佳性能：Wav2Vec2模型第22层达到ATWV 0.691、MTWV 0.7003，错误告警率和漏检率分别为0.0164和0.0547。在噪声环境中也显著优于传统MFCC基线。

Conclusion: 自监督学习特征能够有效提升儿童语音的零样本关键词检测性能，解决了儿童语音特殊特征带来的挑战。

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in
adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems
due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper
introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art
self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec.
Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a
Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for
training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing,
demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved
state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech.
Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best,
delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of
false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a
set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed
the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess
the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted
using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The
results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based
baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions.
To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an
additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant
contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for
children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the
distinct characteristics of child speakers.

Abstract: Speaker Identification refers to the process of identifying a person using
one's voice from a collection of known speakers. Environmental noise,
reverberation and distortion make the task of automatic speaker identification
challenging as extracted features get degraded thus affecting the performance
of the speaker identification (SID) system. This paper proposes a robust noise
adapted SID system under noisy, mismatched, reverberated and distorted
environments. This method utilizes an auditory features called cochleagram to
extract speaker characteristics and thus identify the speaker. A $128$ channel
gammatone filterbank with a frequency range from $50$ to $8000$ Hz was used to
generate 2-D cochleagrams. Wideband as well as narrowband noises were used
along with clean speech to obtain noisy cochleagrams at various levels of
signal to noise ratio (SNR). Both clean and noisy cochleagrams of only $-5$ dB
SNR were then fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to build a speaker
model in order to perform SID which is referred as noise adapted speaker model
(NASM). The NASM was trained using a certain noise and then was evaluated using
clean and various types of noises. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed
system was tested using reverberated as well as distorted test data.
Performance of the proposed system showed a measurable accuracy improvement
over existing neurogram based SID system.

Abstract: In recent decades, the field of signal processing has rapidly evolved due to
diverse application demands, leading to a rich array of scientific questions
and research areas. The forms of signals, their formation mechanisms, and the
information extraction methods vary by application, resulting in diverse signal
processing techniques. Common techniques can be categorized into three types:
transformation, detection, and filtering. Signal transformation converts
signals from their original domain to a more suitable target domain for
analysis; signal detection aims to identify the existence of relevant
information within a signal and its specific time and location; and signal
filtering focuses on extracting or separating source signals of interest from
observed signals. In acoustic signal processing, techniques include sound
source localization, sound event detection, voiceprint extraction and
recognition, noise reduction, and source separation, with applications in
speech communication, voice interaction, smart healthcare, and industrial
diagnostics. Recently, the advancement of deep learning technologies has
shifted methodologies in acoustic signal processing from knowledge-driven to
data-driven approaches, leading to significant research outcomes. This paper
aims to systematically summarize the principles and methods of data-driven
acoustic signal processing, providing a comprehensive understanding framework
for academic exploration and practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音识别模型训练需要识别过的音频数据，但实际音频往往因保密性问题无法获取

Method: 使用先进的文本到语音模型生成合成音频，通过微调、筛选和评估优化数据生成，用于训练编码器-解码器ASR模型

Result: 在加拿大法语自发对话数据集上进行实验，改善数据生成起到了显著提升最终ASR系统性能的作用

Conclusion: 通过优化合成数据生成，可以实现仅使用文本数据训练出性能可与实际音频训练相比的语音识别模型

Abstract: Supervised training of speech recognition models requires access to
transcribed audio data, which often is not possible due to confidentiality
issues. Our approach to this problem is to generate synthetic audio from a
text-only corpus using a state-of-the-art text-to-speech model with voice
cloning capabilities. Our goal is to achieve automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance comparable to models trained on real data. We explore ways to
optimize synthetic data generation through finetuning, filtering and
evaluation, and its use for training an end-to-end encoder-decoder ASR model.
Experiments were conducted using two datasets of spontaneous, conversational
speech in Qu\'ebec French. We show that improving data generation leads to
large improvements in the final ASR system trained on synthetic data.

*Kevin Putra Santoso,Rizka Wakhidatus Sholikah,Raden Venantius Hari Ginardi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: WaveLLDM是一种轻量级潜在扩散模型，通过神经音频编解码器和潜在扩散相结合，在压缩潜在空间中处理音频，降低计算复杂度但保持重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量音频在多种应用中至关重要，但噪声、压缩和传输伪影造成的退化仍是主要挑战。传统扩散模型需要大量计算资源且难以处理较长缺失片段。

Method: 提出WaveLLDM架构，集成高效的神经音频编解码器与潜在扩散模型，在压缩潜在空间中进行音频修复和去噪，而非传统的时间或频谱域处理。

Result: 在Voicebank+DEMAND测试集上，WaveLLDM实现了准确的频谱重建（LSD分数0.48-0.60），但对未见数据的感知质量和语音清晰度仍低于最先进方法（WB-PESQ 1.62-1.71，STOI 0.76-0.78）。

Conclusion: 虽然存在架构调优不足、缺乏微调和训练时间不足等限制，但结合神经音频编解码器和潜在扩散模型的灵活架构为未来发展提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: High-quality audio is essential in a wide range of applications, including
online communication, virtual assistants, and the multimedia industry. However,
degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a
major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio
restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and
struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM
(Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an
efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and
denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral
domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing
computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical
evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves
accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores
(0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still
underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual
quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and
STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to
suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient
training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a
neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for
future development.

Abstract: One in four people dementia live alone, leading family members to take on
caregiving roles from a distance. Many researchers have developed remote
monitoring solutions to lessen caregiving needs; however, limitations remain
including privacy preserving solutions, activity recognition, and model
generalizability to new users and environments. Structural vibration sensor
systems are unobtrusive solutions that have been proven to accurately monitor
human information, such as identification and activity recognition, in
controlled settings by sensing surface vibrations generated by activities.
However, when deploying in an end user's home, current solutions require a
substantial amount of labeled data for accurate activity recognition. Our
scalable solution adapts synthesized data from near-surface acoustic audio to
pretrain a model and allows fine tuning with very limited data in order to
create a robust framework for daily routine tracking.

TL;DR: 提出了FFTP全频时域分块策略和SpecMask数据增强方法，显著提升音频分类性能并大幅降低计算量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频分类模型采用计算机视觉中的方形分块方法，破坏了频谱图的连续频率模式，产生过多分块导致训练缓慢和计算量增加

Method: FFTP分块策略：跨全频带但局部时域上下文的分块方式，匹配频谱图的时频不对称性；SpecMask增强：在固定掩码预算下结合全频和局部时频掩码

Result: 在AST和AuM模型上应用，AudioSet-18k mAP提升最高+6.76，SpeechCommandsV2准确率提升最高+8.46，计算量减少最高83.26%

Conclusion: FFTP和SpecMask方法在保持频谱连续性的同时显著提升了音频分类性能并大幅降低了计算成本

Abstract: Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) have advanced audio classification
by modeling spectrograms as sequences of patches. However, existing models such
as the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and Audio Mamba (AuM) adopt square
patching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and
produces an excessive number of patches, slowing training, and increasing
computation. We propose Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP), a patching
strategy that better matches the time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms by
spanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, preserving
harmonic structure, and significantly reducing patch count and computation. We
also introduce SpecMask, a patch-aligned spectrogram augmentation that combines
full-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under a fixed masking budget,
enhancing temporal robustness while preserving spectral continuity. When
applied on both AST and AuM, our patching method with SpecMask improves mAP by
up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2,
while reducing computation by up to 83.26%, demonstrating both performance and
efficiency gains.

TL;DR: 提出了双分辨率注意力统计池化框架DRASP，通过结合粗粒度全局统计和细粒度注意力分析，在MOS预测中显著优于传统池化方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有池化方法通常只在单一粒度上操作，要么关注全局视角，要么关注帧级分析，可能忽略了互补的感知信息

Method: DRASP框架整合了粗粒度的全局统计摘要和细粒度的感知显著片段注意力分析，采用双视图架构同时捕获整体结构上下文和显著局部细节

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上一致优于基线方法，系统级Spearman相关系数相对平均池化方法提升10.39%

Conclusion: 双分辨率池化框架能够生成更全面鲁棒的音频表示，在MOS预测任务中表现出优异的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: A pooling mechanism is essential for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction,
facilitating the transformation of variable-length audio features into a
concise fixed-size representation that effectively encodes speech quality.
Existing pooling methods typically operate at a singular granularity,
concentrating either on a comprehensive global perspective or a detailed
frame-level analysis, which may overlook complementary perceptual insights. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics
Pooling (DRASP) framework. DRASP integrates both coarse-grained, global
statistical summaries and fine-grained, attentive analyses of perceptually
significant segments. This dual-view architecture empowers our model to
formulate a more thorough and robust representation, capturing both the
overarching structural context and salient local details concurrently.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and strong generalization
ability of the proposed framework. It consistently outperforms various baseline
methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval and AES-Natural), MOS prediction
backbones (including a CLAP-based model and AudioBox-Aesthetics), and different
audio generation systems, achieving a relative improvement of 10.39% in
system-level Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) over the
widely-used average pooling approach.

This challenge is compounded\nby two persistent and intertwined factors: the language's vast dialectal\ndiversity and the prevalence of acoustic noise in real-world environments.\nWhile state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models have advanced ASR\nfor low-resource languages, they often lack explicit mechanisms to handle\nenvironmental noise during pre-training or specialized adaptation strategies\nfor the complex phonetic and lexical variations across Bengali dialects. This\npaper introduces a novel, unified framework designed to address these dual\nchallenges simultaneously. Our approach is founded on the WavLM model, which is\nuniquely pre-trained with a masked speech denoising objective, making it\ninherently robust to acoustic distortions. We propose a specialized multi-stage\nfine-tuning strategy that first adapts the model to general-domain standard\nBengali to establish a strong linguistic foundation and subsequently\nspecializes it for noise-robust dialectal recognition through targeted data\naugmentation.

This tendency has led to a focus on audio tokenization for Large\nModels (LMs). Unlike semantic-only text tokens, audio tokens must both capture\nglobal semantic content and preserve fine-grained acoustic details. Moreover,\nthey provide a discrete method for speech and music that can be effectively\nintegrated into MLLMs. However, existing research is unsuitable in the\ndefinitions of semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. In addition, the evaluation\nof different codecs typically concentrates on specific domains or tasks, such\nas reconstruction or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, which prevents\nfair and comprehensive comparisons. To address these problems, this paper\nprovides suitable definitions for semantic and acoustic tokens and introduces a\nsystematic evaluation framework. This framework allows for a comprehensive\nassessment of codecs' capabilities which evaluate across four dimensions: audio\nreconstruction metric, codebook index (ID) stability, decoder-only transformer\nperplexity, and performance on downstream probe tasks. Our results show the\ncorrectness of the provided suitable definitions and the correlation among\nreconstruction metrics, codebook ID stability, downstream probe tasks and\nperplexity."}

This challenge is compounded\nby two persistent and intertwined factors: the language's vast dialectal\ndiversity and the prevalence of acoustic noise in real-world environments.\nWhile state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models have advanced ASR\nfor low-resource languages, they often lack explicit mechanisms to handle\nenvironmental noise during pre-training or specialized adaptation strategies\nfor the complex phonetic and lexical variations across Bengali dialects. This\npaper introduces a novel, unified framework designed to address these dual\nchallenges simultaneously. Our approach is founded on the WavLM model, which is\nuniquely pre-trained with a masked speech denoising objective, making it\ninherently robust to acoustic distortions. We propose a specialized multi-stage\nfine-tuning strategy that first adapts the model to general-domain standard\nBengali to establish a strong linguistic foundation and subsequently\nspecializes it for noise-robust dialectal recognition through targeted data\naugmentation. The framework is rigorously evaluated on a comprehensive\nbenchmark comprising multiple Bengali dialects under a wide range of simulated\nnoisy conditions, from clean audio to low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly\noutperforms strong baselines, including standard fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 and the\nlarge-scale multilingual Whisper model.

Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has\ndemonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel\nconditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works\nhave explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the\ndiscrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the\nlimited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP\ntasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this\npaper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system\nfor image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural\nproperties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel\nproperties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables\nefficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results\nhave shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves\naverage mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while\nmaintaining identical communication overhead."}

Realistic and interpretable channel\nmodeling is essential to fully realize the potential of such systems. This work\npresents a comprehensive investigation of monostatic sensing channels at\n300~GHz, based on an extensive measurement campaign conducted at 57 co-located\ntransceiver (TRx) positions across three representative indoor scenarios.\nMultipath component (MPC) parameters, including amplitude, delay, and angle,\nare extracted using a high-resolution space-alternating generalized\nexpectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. To cluster the extracted MPCs, an\nimage-processing-based clustering method, i.e., connected component labeling\n(CCL), is applied to group MPCs based on delay-angle consistency. Based on the\nmeasurement data, an environment-aware channel modeling framework is proposed\nto establish mappings between physical scenario attributes (e.g., reflector\ngeometry, surface materials, and roughness) and their corresponding\nchannel-domain manifestations. The framework incorporates both specular and\ndiffuse reflections and leverages several channel parameters, e.g., reflection\nloss, Lambertian scattering, and intra-cluster dispersion models, to\ncharacterize reflection behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed approach can reliably extract physical characteristics, e.g.,\nstructural and material information, from the observed channel characteristics,\noffering a promising foundation for advanced THz ISAC channel modeling."}

This\npaper introduces a new orthogonal multicarrier waveform, namely Affine-Doppler\nDivision Multiplexing (ADDM), which can provide a generic framework and subsume\nthe existing OTFS and AFDM as a particular case. ADDM modulating information\nsymbols in the Affine-Doppler (A-D) domain based on a two-dimensional (2D)\ntransform can enjoy both excellent unambiguous Doppler and Doppler resolution,\nwhich is the same as AFDM but outperforms OTFS. Moreover, benefiting from the\n2D transform, the symbols block of ADDM in the A-D domain undergoes a 2D cyclic\nshift produced by the delay and the Doppler of the channel, similar to the 2D\ncyclic shift in the delay-Doppler domain of cyclic prefix (CP)-OTFS.

We formulate a worst-case achievable rate maximization\nproblem for aerial user subject to constraints including quality-of-service for\nterrestrial users, imperfect jamming directions, minimum antenna separation,\netc. To address the non-convex problem, we propose a fractional\nprogramming-block coordinate descent algorithm that alternately optimizes the\ntransmit precoders, receive combiner, and antenna positions at both transceiver\nsides.

However, the tight integration of these\nfunctionalities inevitably gives rise to various types of interference, posing\nsignificant challenges to existing ISAC waveform designs and rendering\ninterference management a critical concern. Inspired by the development\ntrajectory of wireless communications, different multiple access (MA)\ntechniques, such as orthogonal multiple access (OMA), space-division multiple\naccess (SDMA), and more recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and\nrate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), have been demonstrated to play a pivotal\nrole in efficiently utilizing limited spectrum resources, designing ISAC\nwaveforms, as well as managing inter-user interference and inter-functionality\ninterference in ISAC. Notably, the interplay between MA and ISAC presents\nmutually beneficial integration. On the one hand, ISAC helps MA techniques\nbetter exploit their interference management capability beyond the\ncommunication-only networks.

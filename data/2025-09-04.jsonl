However, they\ncan introduce audio distortions which degrade speaker verification (SV)\nperformance. This study investigates the impact of both traditional and neural\naudio codecs at varying bitrates on three state of-the-art SV models evaluated\non the VoxCeleb1 dataset. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in SV\nperformance across all models and codecs as bitrates decrease. Notably, NACs do\nnot fundamentally break SV performance when compared to traditional codecs.\nThey outperform Opus by 6-8% at low-bitrates (< 12 kbps) and remain marginally\nbehind at higher bitrates ($\\approx$ 24 kbps), with an EER increase of only\n0.4-0.7%. The disparity at higher bitrates is likely due to the primary\noptimization of NACs for perceptual quality, which can inadvertently discard\ncritical speaker-discriminative features, unlike Opus which was designed to\npreserve vocal characteristics. Our investigation suggests that NACs are a\nfeasible alternative to traditional codecs, especially under bandwidth\nlimitations. To bridge the gap at higher bitrates, future work should focus on\ndeveloping speaker-aware NACs or retraining and adapting SV models."}

Current research\non spoofing detection countermeasures remains limited by generalization to\nunseen deepfake attacks and languages. To address this, we propose a gating\nmechanism extracting relevant feature from the speech foundation XLS-R model as\na front-end feature extractor. For downstream back-end classifier, we employ\nMulti-kernel gated Convolution (MultiConv) to capture both local and global\nspeech artifacts. Additionally, we introduce Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as\na similarity metric to enforce diversity in learned features across different\nMultiConv layers. By integrating CKA with our gating mechanism, we hypothesize\nthat each component helps improving the learning of distinct synthetic speech\npatterns.

EEG-MSAF comprises three stages: (1) automated microstate\nfeature extraction, (2) classification with machine learning (ML), and (3)\nfeature ranking using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to highlight key\nbiomarkers. We evaluate on two EEG datasets: the public Chung-Ang University\nEEG (CAUEEG) dataset and a clinical cohort from Thessaloniki Hospital. Our\nframework demonstrates strong performance and generalizability. On CAUEEG,\nEEG-MSAF-SVM achieves \\textbf{89\\% $\\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, surpassing the deep\nlearning baseline CEEDNET by \\textbf{19.3\\%}.

This makes\noptimal resource allocation across power, subcarriers, and decoding orders\ncrucial for interference channels (ICs), where neither transmitters nor\nreceivers can cooperate. Current orthogonal multiple access (OMA) methods, as\nwell as non-orthogonal (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RSMA) schemes, rely on fixed\nheuristics for interference management, leading to suboptimal rates, power\ninefficiency, and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel minPIC\nframework for optimal power, subcarrier, and decoding order allocation in\ngeneral multi-user ICs. Unlike existing methods, minPIC eliminates heuristic\nSIC order assumptions. Despite the convexity of the IC capacity region, fixing\nan SIC order induces non-convexity in resource allocation, traditionally\nrequiring heuristic approximations. We instead introduce a dual-variable-guided\nsorting criterion to identify globally optimal SIC orders, followed by convex\noptimization with auxiliary log-det constraints, efficiently solved via binary\nsearch. We also demonstrate that minPIC could potentially meet the stringent\nhigh-rate, low-power targets of immersive XR and other 6G applications. To the\nbest of our knowledge, minPIC is the first algorithmic realisation of the\nPareto boundary of the SIC-achievable rate region for Gaussian ICs, opening the\ndoor to scalable interference management in cell-free networks."}

Since the legacy wireless systems\nwere designed based on often decades-old assumptions about wireless\ninterference, utilizing these new bands will result in interference with the\nexisting legacy users. Many of these legacy wireless devices are used by\ncritical infrastructure networks upon which society depends. There is an urgent\nneed to develop schemes that can protect legacy users from such interference.\nFor many applications, legacy users are located within\ngeographically-constrained regions. Several studies have proposed mitigating\ninterference through the implementation of exclusion zones near these\ngeographically-constrained regions. In contrast to solutions based on\ngeographic exclusion zones, this paper presents a communication theory-based\nsolution. By leveraging knowledge of these geographically-constrained regions,\nwe aim to reduce the interference impact on legacy users. We achieve this by\nincorporating received power constraints, termed as region constraints, in our\nmassive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system design. We perform a\ncapacity analysis of single-user massive MIMO and a sum-rate analysis of the\nmulti-user massive MIMO system with transmit power and region constraints.

Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with\ndifferent DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance,\ncomputational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains\nchallenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have\ndemonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent\ndesign for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them\nparticularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes\nS2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1)\nSpatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level\nsignal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional\nscanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward\ndirections, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information\nfusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in\nECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated,\nenabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration\nwith others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior\nperformance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios.

Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative\nthat strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity,\nand ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance,\nlightweight computations in CVD diagnosis."}

This study investigates the impact of both traditional and neural\naudio codecs at varying bitrates on three state of-the-art SV models evaluated\non the VoxCeleb1 dataset. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in SV\nperformance across all models and codecs as bitrates decrease. Notably, NACs do\nnot fundamentally break SV performance when compared to traditional codecs.\nThey outperform Opus by 6-8% at low-bitrates (< 12 kbps) and remain marginally\nbehind at higher bitrates ($\\approx$ 24 kbps), with an EER increase of only\n0.4-0.7%. The disparity at higher bitrates is likely due to the primary\noptimization of NACs for perceptual quality, which can inadvertently discard\ncritical speaker-discriminative features, unlike Opus which was designed to\npreserve vocal characteristics.

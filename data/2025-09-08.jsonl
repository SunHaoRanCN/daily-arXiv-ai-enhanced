Acoust. Soc. Am", "summary": "The localization of acoustic reflectors is a fundamental component in various\napplications, including room acoustics analysis, sound source localization, and\nacoustic scene analysis. Time Delay Estimation (TDE) is essential for\ndetermining the position of reflectors relative to a sensor array. Traditional\nTDE algorithms generally yield time delays that are integer multiples of the\noperating sampling period, potentially lacking sufficient time resolution. To\nachieve subsample TDE accuracy, various interpolation methods, including\nparabolic, Gaussian, frequency, and sinc interpolation, have been proposed.\nThis paper presents a comprehensive study on time delay interpolation to\nachieve subsample accuracy for acoustic reflector localization in reverberant\nconditions. We derive the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula from the\npreviously proposed sinc interpolation in the context of short-time windowed\nTDE for acoustic reflector localization. Simulations show that sinc and\nWhittaker-Shannon interpolation outperform existing methods in terms of time\ndelay error and positional error for critically sampled and band-limited\nreflections. Performance is evaluated on real-world measurements from the\nMYRiAD dataset, showing that sinc and Whittaker-Shannon interpolation\nconsistently provide reliable performance across different sensor-source pairs\nand loudspeaker positions. These results can enhance the precision of acoustic\nreflector localization systems, vital for applications such as room acoustics\nanalysis, sound source localization, and acoustic scene analysis."}

However, similar to traditional communication, it\nalso suffers from eavesdropping threats. Intelligent eavesdroppers could launch\nadvanced semantic analysis techniques to infer secret semantic information.\nTherefore, some researchers have designed Semantic Steganography Communication\n(SemSteCom) scheme to confuse semantic eavesdroppers. However, the\nstate-of-the-art SemSteCom schemes for image transmission rely on the\npre-selected cover image, which limits the universality. To address this issue,\nwe propose a Generative Diffusion Model-based Coverless Semantic Steganography\nCommunication (SemSteDiff) scheme to hide secret images into generated stego\nimages. The semantic related private and public keys enable legitimate receiver\nto decode secret images correctly while the eavesdropper without completely\ntrue key-pairs fail to obtain them.

One emerging application is EM stroke\nimaging, which enables early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of brain\nstrokes. Quantitative imaging is achieved by solving an inverse scattering\nproblem (ISP) that reconstructs permittivity and conductivity maps from\nmeasurements. In general, the reconstruction accuracy is limited by its\ninherent nonlinearity and ill-posedness. Existing methods, including\nlearning-free and learning-based approaches, fail to either incorporate\ncomplicated prior distributions or provide theoretical guarantees, posing\ndifficulties in balancing interpretability, distortion error, and reliability.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a posterior sampling method based on\nlatent diffusion for quantitative EM brain imaging, adapted from a generative\nplug-and-play (PnP) posterior sampling framework. Our approach allows to\nflexibly integrate prior knowledge into physics-based inversion without\nrequiring paired measurement-label datasets. We first learn the prior\ndistribution of targets from an unlabeled dataset, and then incorporate the\nlearned prior into posterior sampling. In particular, we train a latent\ndiffusion model on permittivity and conductivity maps to capture their prior\ndistribution. Then, given measurements and the forward model describing EM wave\nphysics, we perform posterior sampling by alternating between two samplers that\nrespectively enforce the likelihood and prior distributions. Finally, reliable\nreconstruction is obtained through minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation\nbased on the samples. Experimental results on brain imaging demonstrate that\nour approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy\nand structural similarity while maintaining high measurement fidelity."}

We formulate an optimization problem to\nmaximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power\nallocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful\ninsights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze\na special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain\nclosed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field\ninterference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using\nthe Fresnel integrals.

Tensor methods are ubiquitous in many applications of statistical\nlearning, with their biggest advantage of having strong uniqueness properties.\nIn this paper, the uniqueness properties of PCTF3D's constrained coupled\nlow-rank model is assessed. While probabilistic constraints of the coupled\nmodel are handled properly, it is shown that uniqueness highly depends on the\ncoupling used in PCTF3D. After proposing a Jacobian algorithm providing maximum\nrecoverable rank, different coupling strategies presented in the Part I article\nare examined with respect to their uniqueness properties. Finally, an\nidentifiability bound is given for a so-called Cartesian coupling which permits\nenhancing sufficient bounds of the literature."}

Specifically, reverberant speech capturing room acoustic properties\nserves as the primary input, which is combined with panoramic images and text\ndescriptions as supplementary inputs. Each input is processed by its respective\nencoder, and the outputs are fed into cross-attention modules to enable\neffective interaction between different modalities. The MEAN-RIR decoder\ngenerates two distinct components: the first component captures the direct\nsound and early reflections, while the second produces masks that modulate\nlearnable filtered noise to synthesize the late reverberation. These two\ncomponents are mixed to reconstruct the final RIR. The results show that\nMEAN-RIR significantly improves RIR estimation, with notable gains in acoustic\nparameters."}

In this paper, we introduce ROPE,\nwhich, to the best of our knowledge, is the first phase-estimation algorithm\ncapable of (i) handling signals of arbitrary dimension and (ii) operating in\nreal-time, with minimal error. ROPE identifies repetitions within the signal to\nsegment it into (pseudo-)periods and assigns phase values by performing\nefficient, tractable searches over previous signal segments. We extensively\nvalidate the algorithm on a variety of signal types, including trajectories\nfrom chaotic dynamical systems, human motion-capture data, and\nelectrocardiographic recordings. Our results demonstrate that ROPE is robust\nagainst noise and signal drift, and achieves significantly superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art phase estimation methods. This advancement enables\nreal-time analysis of complex biological rhythms, opening new pathways, for\nexample, for early diagnosis of pathological rhythm disruptions and developing\nrhythm-based therapeutic interventions in neurological and cardiovascular\ndisorders."}

While\nthere are many published and powerful deep neural network (DNN)-based methods\nfor SD, few are optimized for resource-constrained platforms such as mobile\ndevices. Additionally, most DNN-based methods for SD are not focusing on\nfull-band (FB) signals, i.e. having 48 kHz sampling rate, and/or low latency\ncases. In this paper we present a causal, low latency, and lightweight\nDNN-based method for full-band SD, leveraging both short and long temporal\npatterns. The method is based on a modified UNet architecture employing\nlook-back frames, temporal spanning of convolutional kernels, and recurrent\nneural networks for exploiting short and long temporal patterns in the signal\nand estimated denoising mask. The DNN operates on a causal frame-by-frame basis\ntaking as an input the STFT magnitude, utilizes inverted bottlenecks inspired\nby MobileNet, employs causal instance normalization for channel-wise\nnormalization, and achieves a real-time factor below 0.02 when deployed on a\nmodern mobile phone. The proposed method is evaluated using established speech\ndenoising metrics and publicly available datasets, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in achieving an (SI-)SDR value that outperforms existing FB and\nlow latency SD methods."}

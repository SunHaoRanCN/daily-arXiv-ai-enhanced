This paper investigates\nchannel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems.\nWe first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the\nplane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid\nspherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model,\nwithin a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario.

ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities,\nis regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging\napplications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate\nboth sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified\nplatform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate\nfrequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,\nintegrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly\noptimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant\ncomputational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or\noptimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,\nDL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced\ncomputational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating\nunder limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time\nsystems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal\nsolutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including\nwaveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data\ndemodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these\nadvantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC\nsystem design.

While text-to-speech (TTS)\ncan be used as a communication aid since it generates synthetic speech, it\nfails to preserve the user's own voice. As such, face-to-voice (FTV) synthesis,\nwhich derives corresponding voices from facial images, provides a promising\nalternative. However, existing methods rely on pre-trained visual encoders, and\nfinetune them to align with speech embeddings, which strips fine-grained\ninformation from facial inputs such as gender or ethnicity, despite their known\ncorrelation with vocal traits.

The system is validated experimentally using a 140~GHz\nwireless testbed with 16-QAM modulation over a 10~GHz bandwidth. Results show\nthat the proposed TED schemes outperform conventional blind TEDs, such as\nGardner and blind implementations of Mueller \\& M\\\"uller, in terms of bit error\nrate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM), and intersymbol interference (ISI)\nsuppression. These capabilities are especially relevant to next-generation\nspaceborne communication systems, where wideband sub-THz links are expected to\nplay a key role in enabling ultra-high-data-rate inter-satellite and deep-space\ncommunications under challenging synchronization constraints."}

This paper\nexplores radio SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) as a key ISAC\napproach, using radio signals for mapping and localization. We analyze radio\nSLAM across different frequency bands, discussing trade-offs in coverage,\nresolution, and hardware requirements. We also highlight opportunities for\nintegration with sensing, positioning, and cooperative networks. The findings\npave the way for standardized solutions in 6G applications such as autonomous\nsystems and industrial robotics."}

Building on recent\nadvances in score-based models, we investigate a specific noise schedule design\nand sampling acceleration by step-skipping to reduce the number of denoising\nsteps during inference. We additionally propose a single-step signal-to-noise\nratio informed denoiser as an extreme case of the step-skipping approach. Our\nmethods achieve significant latency reductions without performance degradation,\nas demonstrated on a synthetic channel dataset representing an urban macrocell\nMIMO communications scenario."}

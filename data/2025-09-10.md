### [1] [Cross-device Zero-shot Label Transfer via Alignment of Time Series Foundation Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06966)
*Neal G. Ravindra,Arijit Sehanobish*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需配对数据的跨设备标签迁移框架，通过时间序列基础模型将不同设备数据映射到共享嵌入空间，并使用对抗对齐方法实现标签迁移


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费级可穿戴设备（如Apple Watch）缺乏医学验证的高质量标签，而手动标注成本高昂且难以扩展。临床活动记录仪数据虽然有高质量标签，但无法直接应用于消费级设备

Method: 使用时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）将源域（如活动记录仪）和目标域（如Apple Watch）的原始时间序列信号投影到共享潜在嵌入空间，然后通过对抗对齐方法强制两个域的嵌入分布对齐

Result: 开发了Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings方法，成功实现了跨设备类型的标签迁移，无需配对数据

Conclusion: 该框架为消费级可穿戴设备提供了一种有效的标签获取方法，解决了医学验证标签稀缺的问题，具有重要的实际应用价值

Abstract: High-quality, medically validated labels exist for clinical actigraphy data
but not for ubiquitous consumer wearables like the Apple Watch. Manually
labeling wearables data is expensive and doesn't scale. This paper offers a
novel framework that transfers valuable labels from a source domain (e.g.,
actigraphy) to a target domain (e.g., Apple Watch) without requiring paired
data. Instead of working with raw time-series signals, we project both domains
into a shared latent embedding space using time-series foundation models
(TSFMs) and develop a new framework to align the cross-device representations.
Our method, Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings forces the distributions
of source and target embeddings to align within this space, facilitating label
transfer across device type.

### [2] [Cross-field SNR Analysis and Tensor Channel Estimation for Multi-UAV Near-field Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06967)
*Tianyu Huo,Jian Xiong,Yiyan Wu,Songjie Yang,Bo Liu,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了分布式近场多无人机通信系统的信道估计，提出了基于混合球面-平面波模型的两种算法：SD-OMP和tensor-OMP，后者在保持性能的同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中极大规模天线阵列在近场区域运行，传统远场平面波假设失效，需要开发适用于分布式近场多无人机系统的信道估计方法。

Method: 推导了三种模型的闭式SNR表达式，提出SD-OMP算法（将极坐标域推广到联合考虑仰角、方位角和距离）和tensor-OMP算法（利用信道张量结构）。

Result: 仿真结果显示tensor-OMP在NMSE性能上与SD-OMP相当，但计算复杂度更低，可扩展性更好。

Conclusion: 混合球面-平面波模型在建模精度和分析易处理性之间取得良好平衡，tensor-OMP算法为分布式近场多无人机通信提供了高效的信道估计解决方案。

Abstract: Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is key to enhancing spectral efficiency
in 6G networks. Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often
operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the
conventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates
channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems.
We first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the
plane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid
spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model,
within a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario. The analysis shows
that HSPWM achieves a good balance between modeling accuracy and analytical
tractability. Based on this, we propose two channel estimation algorithms: the
spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and the tensor-OMP. The
SD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and
range. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor,
enabling the use of tensor-OMP. Simulation results demonstrate that tensor-OMP
achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP,
while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC系统作为6G及以后网络的关键技术，需要解决传统优化方法计算复杂度高的问题，深度学习技术能提供高效近优解决方案

Method: 综述性研究方法，先介绍深度学习架构和ISAC基础知识，然后分类评论现有的DL基于ISAC技术，分析其优势和挑战

Result: 深度学习技术能够高效处理ISAC系统中的多种复杂任务，包括波形设计、通道估计、感知信号处理、数据解调和干扰减少，适合实时系统的低计算资源和低延迟要求

Conclusion: DL基于ISAC技术为6G网络提供了高效解决方案，能够降低硬件复杂度、缓解频谱拥堵和提高能源效率，是未来研究的重要方向

Abstract: This article comprehensively reviews recent developments and research on deep
learning-based (DL-based) techniques for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) systems. ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities,
is regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging
applications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate
both sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified
platform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate
frequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,
integrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly
optimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant
computational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or
optimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,
DL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced
computational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating
under limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time
systems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal
solutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including
waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data
demodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these
advantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC
system design. After briefly introducing DL architectures and ISAC
fundamentals, this survey presents a comprehensive and categorized review of
state-of-the-art DL-based techniques for ISAC, highlights their key advantages
and major challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.

### [4] [Modeling the Doppler Shift in Cislunar Environment with Gaussian Mixture Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07134)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study investigates the RF-based Doppler shift distribution
characterization of the Lunar South Pole (LSP) based inter-satellite link (ISL)
in varying inclination. Doppler shift in parts per million (ppm) is determined
and analyzed, as it provides an independence from the carrier frequency. Due to
unknown relative velocity states duration, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is
found to be the best fitting distribution for ISLs with $1^\circ$ inclination
interval Doppler shift with respect to a predetermined satellite.
Goodness-of-fit is investigated and quantified with Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and weighted mean relative difference (WMRD) error metrics.
Simulation results show that ISL Doppler shifts reach up to $\pm1.89$ ppm as
the inclination of the other orbit deviates higher from the reference orbit,
inclining $80^\circ$. Regarding the error measurements of GMM fitting, the WMRD
and KL divergence metrics for ISL take values up to 0.6575 and 2.2963,
respectively.

*Paula Isabel Tilleria Lucero,Bryan Fernando Sarango Rodríguez,Fernando Darío Almeida García,José Cândido Silveira Santos Filho*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文对RIS辅助无线系统进行精确渐近分析，解决了先前研究的三个关键限制：固定分集增益的传播环境、受限空间相关性剖面，以及在高SNR区域失效的近似方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服先前RIS辅助无线系统分析中的三个关键局限性：固定分集增益环境、受限相关性剖面，以及高SNR区域不准确的近似方法。

Method: 采用精确渐近分析方法，关注SNR分布的左尾部，考虑任意相关的Nakagami-m衰落信道，以处理一般相关性剖面和可变分集/编码增益的衰落环境。

Result: 分析表明衰落相关性导致PDF和CDF渐近行为发生水平位移（在对数-dB尺度上表现为直线移动），线性系数量化这种位移而角度系数保持不变。高敏感性源于所有边际渐近项的聚合贡献。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对RIS辅助系统在高SNR区域性能的精确理解，揭示了相关性对系统渐近行为的定量影响机制，为相关无线系统设计提供了重要理论依据。

Abstract: This paper addresses three critical limitations in previous analyses of
RIS-aided wireless systems: propagation environments with fixed diversity gain,
restricted spatial correlation profiles, and approximation methods that fail to
capture the system behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. To
overcome these challenges, we conduct an exact asymptotic analysis focused on
the left tail of the SNR distribution, which plays a critical role in high-SNR
system performance. Additionally, to account for general correlation profiles
and fading environments with variable diversity and coding gains, we consider
arbitrarily correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. The analytical results show
that fading correlation induces a horizontal shift in the asymptotic behavior
-- represented as a straight line in the log-dB scale -- of the PDF and CDF,
displacing these curves to the left. The asymptotic linear coefficient
quantifies this shift, while the angular coefficient remains unaffected.
Moreover, the results reveal that the high sensitivity of the linear
coefficient to correlation arises from the aggregated contribution of all
marginal asymptotic terms, effectively capturing each channel's correlation
characteristics.

### [6] [Joint Spatial and Spectral Hybrid Precoding for Multi-User MIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07229)
*Navid Reyhanian,Reza Ghaderi Zefreh,Parisa Ramezani,Emil Björnson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于WMMSE的BCD方法，用于优化毫米波MU-MIMO-OFDM系统中的混合预编码，解决了PAPR、OOB发射和相位误差等实际问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波MIMO系统由于硬件限制无法仅依赖数字预编码，混合预编码在性能和成本间取得平衡。OFDM系统面临高PAPR、OOB发射和相位误差等挑战，需要鲁棒的优化方案。

Method: 采用加权最小均方误差(WMMSE)和块坐标下降(BCD)方法，迭代优化发射端的数字-RF预编码器和用户端的数字-RF组合器，提出低成本可扩展的优化方法解决BCD子问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了毫米波混合MIMO-OFDM系统中的预编码优化问题，在功率、PAPR和OOB发射约束下实现了鲁棒的性能。

Abstract: The deployment of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems cannot rely solely on digital precoding due to hardware
constraints. Instead, hybrid precoding, which combines digital and radio
frequency (RF) techniques, has emerged as a potential alternative. This
approach strikes a balance between performance and cost, addressing the
limitations of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters in mmWave
systems. mmWave systems are designed to function in wideband channels with
frequency selectivity, necessitating the use of orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) to mitigate dispersive channels. However, OFDM faces
several challenges. First, it suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) due to the linear combination of subcarriers. Second, it suffers from
out-of-band (OOB) emissions due to the sharp spectral transitions of OFDM
subcarriers and windowing-induced spectral leakage. Furthermore, phase shifter
(PS) impairments at the RF transmitter precoder and the user combiner represent
a limitation in practical mmWave systems, leading to phase errors. This work
addresses these challenges.
  We study the problem of robust digital-RF precoding optimization for the
downlink sum-rate maximization in hybrid multi-user (MU) MIMO-OFDM systems
under maximum transmit power, PAPR, and OOB emission constraints. The
formulated maximization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We
propose a weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) based block coordinate
descent (BCD) method to iteratively optimize digital-RF precoders at the
transmitter and digital-RF combiners at the users. Low-cost and scalable
optimization approaches are proposed to efficiently solve the BCD subproblems.
Extensive simulation results are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed approaches and exhibit their superiority relative to well-known
benchmarks.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于驻波的波控可重构智能表面(RIS)设计，通过单频驻波在传输线上产生直流偏置来控制反射，降低了传统RIS的复杂度和物理尺寸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验发现偏置生成效果依赖于阻抗匹配（理论未考虑此因素），并证明单频驻波可实现接近法线方向的单波束转向。

Conclusion: 波控RIS方法能够简化RIS设计，单频驻波控制方案具有可行性，但需要考虑阻抗匹配等实际因素。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), an emerging technology proposed
for inclusion in next generation wireless communication systems, are
programmable surfaces that can adaptively reflect incident electromagnetic
radiation in different desired directions. To reduce the complexity and
physical profile of conventional RIS designs, a novel concept known as
Wave-Controlled RIS has been proposed, in which standing waves along a
transmission line are used to generate the required dc bias for reflective
control. This paper shows the design of such a Wave-Controlled RIS and its
biasing transmission line. The effectiveness of this approach in generating the
correct dc bias from a single standing wave frequency is analyzed through both
theoretical modeling and experimental validation, which uncovered a dependence
on impedance matching not accounted for by the theory. Additionally, the
potential for reflective control using only a single standing wave frequency on
the biasing transmission line is explored, demonstrating the ability of
single-beam steering toward angles near broadside.

Conclusion: 该方法在真实环境中表现稳定，能有效提升人机协作中的人类性能增强应用效果

Abstract: Electrooculography (EOG) is widely used for gaze tracking in Human-Robot
Collaboration (HRC). However, baseline drift caused by low-frequency noise
significantly impacts the accuracy of EOG signals, creating challenges for
further sensor fusion. This paper presents an Eye Movement Feature-Guided
De-drift (FGD) method for mitigating drift artifacts in EOG signals. The
proposed approach leverages active eye-movement feature recognition to
reconstruct the feature-extracted EOG baseline and adaptively correct signal
drift while preserving the morphological integrity of the EOG waveform. The FGD
is evaluated using both simulation data and real-world data, achieving a
significant reduction in mean error. The average error is reduced to
0.896{\deg} in simulation, representing a 36.29% decrease, and to 1.033{\deg}
in real-world data, corresponding to a 26.53% reduction. Despite additional and
unpredictable noise in real-world data, the proposed method consistently
outperforms conventional de-drifting techniques, demonstrating its
effectiveness in practical applications such as enhancing human performance
augmentation.

Abstract: The design and technology development of 6G-enabled networked intelligent
systems needs an accurate real-time channel model as the cornerstone. However,
with the new requirements of 6G-enabled networked intelligent systems, the
conventional channel modeling methods face many limitations. Fortunately, the
multi-modal sensors equipped on the intelligent agents bring timely
opportunities, i.e., the intelligent integration and mutually beneficial
mechanism between communications and multi-modal sensing could be investigated
based on the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. In this case, the
mapping relationship between physical environment and electromagnetic channel
could be explored via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). This article presents a
novel multi-modal intelligent channel modeling (MMICM) framework for 6G-enabled
networked intelligent systems, which establishes a nonlinear model between
multi-modal sensing and channel characteristics, including large-scale and
small-scale channel characteristics. The architecture and features of proposed
intelligent modeling framework are expounded and the key technologies involved
are also analyzed. Finally, the system-engaged applications and potential
research directions of MMICM framework are outlined.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个结合信号去噪和生理相关特征提取的机器学习流程，用于早产预测，CatBoost分类器在TPEHGT数据集上达到97.28%准确率和0.9988 AUC值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早产是新生儿死亡和长期健康并发症的主要原因，早期检测对及时医疗干预至关重要。现有研究存在类别不平衡、过采样不当和特征生理相关性有限等问题。

Method: 使用Karhunen-Loève变换进行信号去噪，提取Mel频率倒谱系数、小波系数统计描述符和归一化功率谱峰值等生理相关特征，评估多种分类器包括逻辑回归、SVM、随机森林、梯度提升、多层感知机和CatBoost。

Result: CatBoost分类器结合KLT去噪在TPEHGT数据集上获得最佳性能：97.28%准确率和0.9988 AUC。消融研究证实了去噪和生理特征的重要性，TOCO信号并未显著提升EHG单独预测效果。

Conclusion: 结合去噪技术和领域相关特征可以构建高精度、鲁棒且临床可解释的早产预测模型，支持开发成本效益高、可及性强的预测工具，特别适用于资源有限的医疗环境。

Abstract: Preterm birth (PTB), defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is a
leading cause of neonatal mortality and long term health complications. Early
detection is essential for enabling timely medical interventions.
Electrohysterography (EHG) and tocography (TOCO) are promising non invasive
tools for PTB prediction, but prior studies often suffer from class imbalance,
improper oversampling, and reliance on features with limited physiological
relevance. This work presents a machine learning pipeline incorporating robust
preprocessing, physiologically grounded feature extraction, and rigorous
evaluation. Features were extracted from EHG (and TOCO) signals using Mel
frequency cepstral coefficients, statistical descriptors of wavelet
coefficients, and peaks of the normalized power spectrum. Signal quality was
enhanced via Karhunen Lo\`eve Transform (KLT) denoising through eigenvalue
based subspace decomposition. Multiple classifiers, including Logistic
Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting,
Multilayer Perceptron, and CatBoost, were evaluated on the TPEHGT dataset. The
CatBoost classifier with KLT denoising achieved the highest performance on
fixed interval segments of the TPEHGT dataset, reaching 97.28% accuracy and an
AUC of 0.9988. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of both KLT
denoising and physiologically informed features. Comparative analysis showed
that including TOCO signals did not substantially improve prediction over EHG
alone, highlighting the sufficiency of EHG for PTB detection. These results
demonstrate that combining denoising with domain relevant features can yield
highly accurate, robust, and clinically interpretable models, supporting the
development of cost effective and accessible PTB prediction tools, particularly
in low resource healthcare settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces SA-OOSC, a multimodal large language models
(MLLM)-distilled semantic communication framework that achieves efficient
semantic coding with scenario-aware importance allocations. This approach
addresses a critical limitation of existing object-oriented semantic
communication (OOSC) systems - assigning static importance values to specific
classes of objects regardless of their contextual relevance. Our framework
utilizes MLLMs to identify the scenario-augmented (SA) semantic importance for
objects within the image. Through knowledge distillation with the
MLLM-annotated data, our vectorization/de-vectorization networks and JSCC
encoder/decoder learn to dynamically allocate coding resources based on
contextual significance, i.e., distinguishing between high-importance objects
and low-importance according to the SA scenario information of the task. The
framework features three core innovations: a MLLM-guided knowledge distillation
pipeline, an importance-weighted variable-length JSCC framework, and novel loss
function designs that facilitate the knowledge distillation within the JSCC
framework. Experimental validation demonstrates our framework's superior coding
efficiency over conventional semantic communication systems, with open-sourced
MLLM-annotated and human-verified datasets established as new benchmarks for
future research in semantic communications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for accurately estimating the relative position
between two nodes with unknown locations in a diffusion-based molecular
communication environment. A specialized node structure is designed, combining
a central absorbing receiver with multiple transmitters placed at predefined
spherical coordinates. Pilot molecules are released, and their absorption time
and concentration are measured. By partitioning the spherical coordinate space,
these spatially distinct measurements serve as input to a multilayer perceptron
(MLP)-based model. The proposed method significantly improves the precision of
distance and direction estimation. Simulation results demonstrate localization
accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of the neural network model in capturing
the underlying physical characteristics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种系统框架来评估三重冗余稀疏线性数组对所有可能两个传感器故障的稳健性，发现现有设计存在隐藏的脏点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多重冗余稀疏数组能够承受多个传感器故障，但仍然存在隐藏的依赖关系影响其完全稳健性，需要系统化的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种系统框架，通过对所有可能的两个传感器故障情况进行分析，评估三重冗余稀疏线性数组的稳健性。

Result: 对现有的代表性三重冗余数组进行故障分析，发现它们对某些特定传感器对的故障存在隐藏的脏点。

Conclusion: 该方法具有重要的档案价值，能够通过客观手段评估任何现有或未来的三重冗余稀疏数组的稳健性。

Abstract: As the field of sparse arrays progressed, numerous array designs have been
introduced with a focus on larger apertures and higher degrees of freedom
(DOFs), resulting in maximally economic sparse arrays (MESAs) that operate with
the least number of sensors required to provide a given aperture while ensuring
a hole-free difference coarray (DCA). Consequently, MESAs are least robust to
sensor failures and cannot afford the failure of even a single sensor.
Multifold redundant sparse arrays (MFRSAs) provide a practical solution to the
problem of sensor failures in sparse arrays by making sure that the array
contains enough sensor pairs necessary to produce each spatial lag multiple
times. Owing to this property, a \b{eta}-fold redundant array can withstand
simultaneous failure of at least \b{eta}-1 sensors without losing the hole-free
DCA property. Nevertheless, MFRSAs are also prone to hidden dependencies that
prevent them from being fully robust. In this work, we present a systematic
framework to evaluate the robustness of triple redundant sparse linear arrays
(TRSLAs) against all possible two-sensor failures. After detailing the proposed
approach, we present the failure analysis of representative TRSLAs available in
existing literature. It is found that existing TRSLAs have some hidden
vulnerabilities against the failure of some peculiar sensor pairs.
Corresponding MATLAB programs and numerical simulations are provided for
evaluation and use by the array processing community. The proposed approach has
a great archival value as it can evaluate the robustness of any present or
future TRSLAs through objective means.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for integrated communication and computing (ICC)
transceiver design in time-varying millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels. In
particular, in order to cope with the dynamics of time-varying mmWave channels,
the detection of communication symbols and the execution of an over-the-air

as opposed to existing state-of-the-art (SotA) on ICC where perfect knowledge
of the channel at all time instances is typically assumed. For clarity of
exposition, we consider a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) uplink scenario
where multiple single-antenna user equipment (UE) transmit to a base station
(BS) equipped with multiple antennas, such that each UE, or edge device (ED),
precodes its own transmit signal, while the BS, or access points (APs), also
performs receive beamforming. The proposed transceiver framework then estimates
channel state information (CSI) and data symbols in parallel, using a bilinear
Gaussian belief propagation (BiGaBP) algorithm for joint channel and data
detection (JCDE), aided by a channel prediction (CP) algorithm executed before
each estimation window at the BS. The AirComp operation is then executed by
means of an optimal combination of the residual signal. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in performing ICC in
challenging time-varying mmWave channels, with minimal degradation to both
communication and computing performance.

Abstract: In wireless sensor networks for reusable launchers, the electromagnetic
characterization and electromagnetic compatibility analyses are relevant due to
the reference operational scenario, which implies a complex, and sometimes
dynamic, electromagnetic environment. This work proposes a methodological
framework for the design of the network and for the analysis of the related
electromagnetic environment within the stages of a given launcher. Based on the
preliminary positioning of the network nodes, the framework prescribes a
workflow and the related toolset for determining the optimal network topology
focusing on the weights, the operation of the transceivers, and the overall
radiated power. The optimal network configuration is simulated by using
computational electromagnetics strategies in order to assess the
electromagnetic environment induced by the sensor network itself. The paper
provides some results concerning a case study for a specific launcher.

Conclusion: 该方案为未来超密集低轨道卫星通信网络提供了一种高效的干扰缓解解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new architecture for the low-earth orbit (LEO)
satellite ground station aided by movable antenna (MA) array. Unlike
conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the MA array can flexibly adjust
antenna positions to reconfigure array geometry, for more effectively
mitigating interference and improving communication performance in ultra-dense
LEO satellite networks. To reduce movement overhead, we configure antenna
positions at the antenna initialization stage, which remain unchanged during
the whole communication period of the ground station. To this end, an
optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average achievable rate of
the ground station by jointly optimizing its antenna position vector (APV) and
time-varying beamforming weights, i.e., antenna weight vectors (AWVs). To solve
the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we adopt the Lagrangian dual
transformation and quadratic transformation to reformulate the objective
function into a more tractable form. Then, we develop an efficient block
coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes the APV
and AWVs until convergence is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that our
proposed MA scheme significantly outperforms traditional FPA by increasing the
achievable rate at ground stations under various system setups, thus providing
an efficient solution for interference mitigation in future ultra-dense LEO
satellite communication networks.

Abstract: In this work, we propose the design of modulation schemes that improve the

characteristics of practical energy harvesting circuits, we formulate a
dual-objective rate-energy (RE) region optimization problem to jointly maximize
the discrete-input mutual information (DIMI) and harvested current. The problem
is solved using the epsilon-constraint method and optimized constellations are
designed for various energy harvesting thresholds. We then evaluate the
performance of the optimized constellations under three different fluid antenna
(FA) port selection strategies: (i) Best Port, (ii) Fixed Port, and (iii)
Random Port. Our simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains
of optimized constellations over conventional constellations in both
information rate and energy harvesting.

Conclusion: 该方案为下一代太空通信系统提供了一种高效的联合时钟恢复和均衡解决方案，在挑战性同步条件下能够支持超高数据速率的卫星间和深空通信。

Abstract: This paper proposes and experimentally evaluates a joint clock recovery (CR)
and equalization architecture tailored for high-speed sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
wireless communication links. Specifically, a Baud-spaced digital receiver
architecture is investigated that combines a constant modulus algorithm (CMA)
equalizer with a blind timing error detector (TED), enabling robust symbol
timing synchronization without decision-directed (DD) feedback or pilot
symbols. The proposed TED leverages the CMA filter coefficients to estimate
timing errors, which are then used to drive a Farrow interpolator operating at
twice the symbol rate. The system is validated experimentally using a 140~GHz
wireless testbed with 16-QAM modulation over a 10~GHz bandwidth. Results show
that the proposed TED schemes outperform conventional blind TEDs, such as
Gardner and blind implementations of Mueller \& M\"uller, in terms of bit error
rate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM), and intersymbol interference (ISI)
suppression. These capabilities are especially relevant to next-generation
spaceborne communication systems, where wideband sub-THz links are expected to
play a key role in enabling ultra-high-data-rate inter-satellite and deep-space
communications under challenging synchronization constraints.

TL;DR: Whisper语音识别模型在噪声环境下存在过度自信问题，错误预测却给出高置信度。本文提出轻量级后处理校准框架，通过选择性温度缩放降低校准误差58%，提升噪声条件下的置信度可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代端到端语音识别模型如Whisper在噪声环境中不仅识别准确率下降，还表现出过度自信问题，即对错误预测赋予高置信度，这在实际应用中可能带来严重后果。

Method: 提出轻量级后处理校准框架，检测潜在的过度自信错误，并选择性应用温度缩放技术，无需修改底层ASR模型。

Result: 在低信噪比范围(-18至-5 dB)的R-SPIN数据集评估中，该方法将预期校准误差(ECE)降低58%，归一化交叉熵(NCE)提升三倍。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效缓解Whisper模型在严重噪声条件下的过度自信问题，提供更可靠的置信度估计，且具有轻量级、无需模型修改的优点。

Abstract: Modern end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models like Whisper not
only suffer from reduced recognition accuracy in noise, but also exhibit
overconfidence - assigning high confidence to wrong predictions. We conduct a
systematic analysis of Whisper's behavior in additive noise conditions and find
that overconfident errors increase dramatically at low signal-to-noise ratios,
with 10-20% of tokens incorrectly predicted with confidence above 0.7. To
mitigate this, we propose a lightweight, post-hoc calibration framework that
detects potential overconfidence and applies temperature scaling selectively to
those tokens, without altering the underlying ASR model. Evaluations on the
R-SPIN dataset demonstrate that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio range (-18 to
-5 dB), our method reduces the expected calibration error (ECE) by 58% and
triples the normalized cross entropy (NCE), yielding more reliable confidence
estimates under severe noise conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统助听器将噪声抑制和听力损失补偿作为独立任务处理，缺乏系统优化，忽视了这两个关键任务之间的相互作用，导致在嘈杂环境中性能显著下降。

Method: 提出听力图特定编码器将稀疏听力图转换为深度表示，使用基于仿射调制的听力图融合频率-时间Conformer自适应融合特征，并引入语音活动检测辅助训练任务。

Result: AFN-HearNet在多个数据集上的实验表明，在HASQI和PESQ等关键指标上显著优于最先进的上下文融合联合模型，实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Conclusion: AFN-HearNet通过同时处理噪声抑制和听力损失补偿任务，有效解决了传统助听器在嘈杂环境中的性能问题，为个性化语音增强服务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Hearing aids (HAs) are widely used to provide personalized speech enhancement
(PSE) services, improving the quality of life for individuals with hearing
loss. However, HA performance significantly declines in noisy environments as
it treats noise reduction (NR) and hearing loss compensation (HLC) as separate
tasks. This separation leads to a lack of systematic optimization, overlooking
the interactions between these two critical tasks, and increases the system
complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel audiogram fusion
network, named AFN-HearNet, which simultaneously tackles the NR and HLC tasks
by fusing cross-domain audiogram and spectrum features. We propose an
audiogram-specific encoder that transforms the sparse audiogram profile into a
deep representation, addressing the alignment problem of cross-domain features
prior to fusion. To incorporate the interactions between NR and HLC tasks, we
propose the affine modulation-based audiogram fusion frequency-temporal
Conformer that adaptively fuses these two features into a unified deep
representation for speech reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a voice
activity detection auxiliary training task to embed speech and non-speech
patterns into the unified deep representation implicitly. We conduct
comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets to validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module. The results indicate that the
AFN-HearNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in-context fusion joint
models regarding key metrics such as HASQI and PESQ, achieving a considerable
trade-off between performance and efficiency. The source code and data will be
released at https://github.com/deepnetni/AFN-HearNet.

Conclusion: 研究为最小延迟实时转译模型设计提供了基准线，并展示了延迟与性能之间的拼换

Abstract: Advances in neural network design and the availability of large-scale labeled
datasets have driven major improvements in piano transcription. Existing
approaches target either offline applications, with no restrictions on
computational demands, or online transcription, with delays of 128-320 ms.
However, most real-time musical applications require latencies below 30 ms. In
this work, we investigate whether and how the current state-of-the-art online
transcription model can be adapted for real-time piano transcription.
Specifically, we eliminate all non-causal processing, and reduce computational
load through shared computations across core model components and variations in
model size. Additionally, we explore different pre- and postprocessing
strategies, and related label encoding schemes, and discuss their suitability
for real-time transcription. Evaluating the adaptions on the MAESTRO dataset,
we find a drop in transcription accuracy due to strictly causal processing as
well as a tradeoff between the preprocessing latency and prediction accuracy.
We release our system as a baseline to support researchers in designing models
towards minimum latency real-time transcription.

Abstract: Controllable Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive
singing voices reflecting user intent. While recent SVS systems achieve high
audio quality, most rely on probabilistic modeling, limiting precise control
over attributes such as dynamics. We address this by focusing on dynamic
control--temporal loudness variation essential for musical expressiveness--and
explicitly condition the SVS model on energy sequences extracted from
ground-truth spectrograms, reducing annotation costs and improving
controllability. We also propose a phoneme-level energy sequence for
user-friendly control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
enabling user-driven dynamics control in SVS. Experiments show our method
achieves over 50% reduction in mean absolute error of energy sequences for
phoneme-level inputs compared to baseline and energy-predictor models, without
compromising synthesis quality.

Abstract: The widespread use of generative AI has shown remarkable success in producing
highly realistic deepfakes, posing a serious threat to various voice biometric
applications, including speaker verification, voice biometrics, audio
conferencing, and criminal investigations. To counteract this, several
state-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been
proposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and
deepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely
undermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.
These AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical
modifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and
quantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \& W, and
DeepFool). In this paper, we investigate the SoTA ADD methods and provide a
comparative analysis to highlight their effectiveness in exposing deepfake
signatures, as well as their vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions. We
conducted an extensive evaluation of ADD methods on five deepfake benchmark
datasets using two categories: raw and spectrogram-based approaches. This
comparative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the strengths and
limitations of SoTA ADD methods against diverse AF attacks. It does not only
highlight vulnerabilities of ADD methods, but also informs the design of more
robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics. It will
further guide future research in developing adaptive defense strategies that
can effectively counter evolving AF techniques.

Result: 预训练模型在混合条件下过度泛化且性能崩溃；针对欺骗检测的微调提高了可分性但对未见组合仍困难；在HSAD上的数据集特定适配获得了显著性能提升(AST>97%，F1≈99%)，但复杂混合音频仍存在残留错误。

Conclusion: 仅靠微调不足够，需要像HSAD这样的混合感知基准来暴露校准失败和模型偏差，HSAD为构建鲁棒可信的语音认证系统提供了数据集和分析框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI has enabled highly realistic speech synthesis and
voice cloning, posing serious risks to voice authentication, smart assistants,
and telecom security. While most prior work frames spoof detection as a binary
task, real-world attacks often involve hybrid utterances that mix genuine and
synthetic speech, making detection substantially more challenging. To address
this gap, we introduce the Hybrid Spoofed Audio Dataset (HSAD), a benchmark
containing 1,248 clean and 41,044 degraded utterances across four classes:
human, cloned, zero-shot AI-generated, and hybrid audio. Each sample is
annotated with spoofing method, speaker identity, and degradation metadata to
enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate six transformer-based models,
including spectrogram encoders (MIT-AST, MattyB95-AST) and self-supervised
waveform models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT). Results reveal critical lessons: pretrained
models overgeneralize and collapse under hybrid conditions; spoof-specific
fine-tuning improves separability but struggles with unseen compositions; and
dataset-specific adaptation on HSAD yields large performance gains (AST greater
than 97 percent and F1 score is approximately 99 percent), though residual
errors persist for complex hybrids. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuning
alone is not sufficient-robust hybrid-aware benchmarks like HSAD are essential
to expose calibration failures, model biases, and factors affecting spoof
detection in adversarial environments. HSAD thus provides both a dataset and an
analytic framework for building resilient and trustworthy voice authentication
systems.

Abstract: Deep learning appears as an appealing solution for Automatic Synthesizer
Programming (ASP), which aims to assist musicians and sound designers in
programming sound synthesizers. However, integrating software synthesizers into
training pipelines is challenging due to their potential non-differentiability.
This work tackles this challenge by introducing a method to approximate
arbitrary synthesizers. Specifically, we train a neural network to map
synthesizer presets onto an audio embedding space derived from a pretrained
model. This facilitates the definition of a neural proxy that produces compact
yet effective representations, thereby enabling the integration of audio
embedding loss into neural-based ASP systems for black-box synthesizers. We
evaluate the representations derived by various pretrained audio models in the
context of neural-based nASP and assess the effectiveness of several neural
network architectures, including feedforward, recurrent, and transformer-based
models, in defining neural proxies. We evaluate the proposed method using both
synthetic and hand-crafted presets from three popular software synthesizers and
assess its performance in a synthesizer sound matching downstream task. While
the benefits of the learned representation are nuanced by resource
requirements, encouraging results were obtained for all synthesizers, paving
the way for future research into the application of synthesizer proxies for
neural-based ASP systems.

Abstract: For individuals who have experienced traumatic events such as strokes, speech
may no longer be a viable means of communication. While text-to-speech (TTS)
can be used as a communication aid since it generates synthetic speech, it
fails to preserve the user's own voice. As such, face-to-voice (FTV) synthesis,
which derives corresponding voices from facial images, provides a promising
alternative. However, existing methods rely on pre-trained visual encoders, and
finetune them to align with speech embeddings, which strips fine-grained
information from facial inputs such as gender or ethnicity, despite their known
correlation with vocal traits. Moreover, these pipelines are multi-stage, which
requires separate training of multiple components, thus leading to training
inefficiency. To address these limitations, we utilize fine-grained facial
attribute modeling by decomposing facial images into non-overlapping segments
and progressively integrating them into a multi-granular representation. This
representation is further refined through multi-task learning of speaker
attributes such as gender and ethnicity at both the visual and acoustic
domains. Moreover, to improve alignment robustness, we adopt a multi-view
training strategy by pairing various visual perspectives of a speaker in terms
of different angles and lighting conditions, with identical speech recordings.
Extensive subjective and objective evaluations confirm that our approach
substantially enhances face-voice congruence and synthesis stability.

Method: 使用ESC-50数据集的2000个标签环境音频记录，构建端到端的深度学习流水线，比较mel谱图、MFCC、循环节奏图、STFT音阶图、CQT音阶图和CENS音阶图等多种特征的分类性能

Conclusion: 对于深度卷积神经网络音频分类任务，mel谱图和MFCC是最优的输入数据表征方式，其性能显著超过其他谱特征和节奏特征

Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains
like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various
spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input
data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm
features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification
is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000
labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning
pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for
multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then
the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio
classification tasks using deep CNNs.

Abstract: The design of mean and variance schedules for the perturbed signal is a
fundamental challenge in generative models. While score-based and Schr\"odinger
bridge-based models require careful selection of the stochastic differential
equation to derive the corresponding schedules, flow-based models address this
issue via vector field matching. However, this strategy often leads to
hallucination artifacts and inefficient training and inference processes due to
the potential inclusion of stochastic components in the vector field.
Additionally, the widely adopted diffusion backbone, NCSN++, suffers from high
computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
target-based generative framework that enhances both the flexibility of
mean/variance schedule design and the efficiency of training and inference
processes. Specifically, we eliminate the stochastic components in the training
loss by reformulating the generative speech enhancement task as a target signal
estimation problem, which therefore leads to more stable and efficient training
and inference processes. In addition, we employ a logistic mean schedule and a
bridge variance schedule, which yield a more favorable signal-to-noise ratio
trajectory compared to several widely used schedules and thus leads to a more
efficient perturbation strategy. Furthermore, we propose a new diffusion
backbone for audio, which significantly improves the efficiency over NCSN++ by
explicitly modeling long-term frame correlations and cross-band dependencies.

TL;DR: Falcon3-Audio是一个基于指令调优LLM和Whisper编码器的音频-语言模型家族，仅使用少量公开音频数据（<30K小时）就在MMAU基准测试中达到最佳性能，展现了卓越的数据和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管音频在人类交流中至关重要，但大型语言模型与音频的整合仍未被充分探索。

Method: 基于指令调优的LLM和Whisper编码器构建音频-语言模型，采用单阶段训练，避免了课程学习、多音频编码器和复杂交叉注意力连接器等常见复杂性。

Result: 7B模型在MMAU基准测试中获得64.14分，与R1-AQA相当；1B模型仍能与2B-13B参数的大型开放模型竞争。模型在仅使用不到30K小时数据的情况下，性能可与使用超过500K小时数据的模型相媲美。

Conclusion: Falcon3-Audio证明了通过简洁的架构设计和高效的数据利用，可以在音频-语言建模领域实现卓越性能，为未来的音频AI研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with
audio remains underexplored -- despite audio's centrality to human
communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models
(ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably
small amount of public audio data -- less than 30K hours (5K unique) --
Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models
on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while
distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency,
single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains
competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through
extensive ablations, we find that common complexities -- such as curriculum
learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors --
are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on
over 500K hours of data.

Conclusion: 当前安全防护措施无法有效应对自适应对抗攻击，迫切需要向下一代防御范式转变，采用能够随威胁环境演变的动态、上下文感知框架。

Abstract: Voice Authentication Systems (VAS) use unique vocal characteristics for
verification. They are increasingly integrated into high-security sectors such
as banking and healthcare. Despite their improvements using deep learning, they
face severe vulnerabilities from sophisticated threats like deepfakes and
adversarial attacks. The emergence of realistic voice cloning complicates
detection, as systems struggle to distinguish authentic from synthetic audio.
While anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs) exist to mitigate these risks, many
rely on static detection models that can be bypassed by novel adversarial
methods, leaving a critical security gap. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we
propose the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), a novel method
that strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated
audio. By altering the voice in imperceptible zones to the human ear, SMIA
creates adversarial samples that sound authentic while deceiving CMs. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our attack against state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models across multiple tasks, under simulated real-world conditions.
SMIA achieved a strong attack success rate (ASR) of at least 82% against
combined VAS/CM systems, at least 97.5% against standalone speaker verification
systems, and 100% against countermeasures. These findings conclusively
demonstrate that current security postures are insufficient against adaptive
adversarial attacks. This work highlights the urgent need for a paradigm shift
toward next-generation defenses that employ dynamic, context-aware frameworks
capable of evolving with the threat landscape.

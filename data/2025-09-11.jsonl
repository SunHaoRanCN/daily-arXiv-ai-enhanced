The system first recognizes sequences\nor lattices of articulatory attributes that serve as a language-universal,\ninterpretable representation of pronunciation, and then transforms them into\nsyllables through a structured knowledge integration process. We introduce two\nevaluation metrics, namely Pronunciation Error Rate (PrER) and Syllable Homonym\nError Rate (SHER), to evaluate the model's ability to capture pronunciation and\nhandle syllable ambiguities. Experimental results on the AISHELL-1 Mandarin\ncorpus demonstrate that the proposed bottom-up framework achieves competitive\nperformance and exhibits better robustness under low-resource conditions\ncompared to the direct syllable prediction model.

Much prior research has focused on\nthe problem setting under the Fully Matched Query (FMQ) condition, where the\nquery specifies only active sounds present in the mixture. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, queries may include inactive sounds that are not present\nin the mixture. This leads to scenarios such as the Fully Unmatched Query (FUQ)\ncondition, where only inactive sounds are specified in the query, and the\nPartially Matched Query (PMQ) condition, where both active and inactive sounds\nare specified. Among these conditions, the performance degradation under the\nPMQ condition has been largely overlooked. To achieve robust TSE under the PMQ\ncondition, we propose context-aware query refinement. This method eliminates\ninactive classes from the query during inference based on the estimated sound\nclass activity.

However, conventional shared-backbone\nmodels frequently suffer from gradient interference and representational\nconflicts between tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Sparse\nMixture-of-Experts Representation Integration Technique (Sparse MERIT), a\nflexible MTL framework that applies frame-wise expert routing over\nself-supervised speech representations. Sparse MERIT incorporates task-specific\ngating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each\nframe, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning.\nExperiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus show that Sparse MERIT consistently\noutperforms baseline models on both SER and SE tasks.

While these processes are well documented in\nbiology, their systematic analysis from an Information and Communication\nTechnology (ICT) perspective remains limited. To address this gap, this article\nis presented as a tutorial with survey elements. It provides the necessary\nbiological background, reformulates inter-plant signaling within ICT\nframeworks, and surveys empirical studies to guide future research and\napplications. First, the paper introduces the fundamental biological processes\nto establish a foundation for readers in communications and networking.\nBuilding on this foundation, existing models of emission, propagation, and\nreception are synthesized for each modality and reformulated in terms of\ntransmitter, channel, and receiver blocks. To complement theory, empirical\nstudies and state-of-the-art sensing approaches are critically examined.\nLooking forward, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future\nresearch directions, with particular emphasis on the emerging vision of the\nInternet of Plants (IoP). This paradigm frames plants as interconnected nodes\nwithin ecological and technological networks, offering new opportunities for\napplications in precision agriculture, ecosystem monitoring, climate\nresilience, and bio-inspired communication systems. By integrating biological\ninsights with ICT frameworks and projecting toward the IoP, this article\nprovides a comprehensive tutorial on plant communication for the communications\nresearch community and establishes a foundation for interdisciplinary advances."}

Much prior research has focused on\nthe problem setting under the Fully Matched Query (FMQ) condition, where the\nquery specifies only active sounds present in the mixture. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, queries may include inactive sounds that are not present\nin the mixture. This leads to scenarios such as the Fully Unmatched Query (FUQ)\ncondition, where only inactive sounds are specified in the query, and the\nPartially Matched Query (PMQ) condition, where both active and inactive sounds\nare specified. Among these conditions, the performance degradation under the\nPMQ condition has been largely overlooked. To achieve robust TSE under the PMQ\ncondition, we propose context-aware query refinement. This method eliminates\ninactive classes from the query during inference based on the estimated sound\nclass activity. Experimental results demonstrate that while conventional\nmethods suffer from performance degradation under the PMQ condition, the\nproposed method effectively mitigates this degradation and achieves high\nrobustness under diverse query conditions."}

This paper evaluates OFDM based ISAC sensing performance under\nrealistic oscillator impairments using a hardware-tuned 3GPP PN model at 130\nGHz and FFT based radar processing. With a numerology of 480 kHz, results show\nthat PN introduces range RMSE floors of 0.04 to 0.05 m and velocity RMSE floors\nof 0.12 to 0.18 m/s. Doppler sidelobe metrics also saturate, with PSLR around\nminus 6 dB and ISLR around minus 4 dB. These findings confirm that range\naccuracy remains bandwidth limited, while velocity estimation and sidelobe\nsuppression are strongly PN-sensitive. The study highlights the importance of\nPN-aware waveform and numerology design for sub-THz ISAC and provides insights\nfor future multi-band transceivers.

Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache\ninto the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and\nfeed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the\ndenoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative\nerrors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that\nminimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency,\na unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from\nself-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and\nSeed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step\nconfigurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces\ninference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower\nsteps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total\nnumber of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the\neffectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving\ncomputational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step\ninference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under\nhigh-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching\nis a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models\nwithout requiring architectural changes or retraining.

Existing\napproaches often rely on large models, which are hard to pre-train and\nfine-tune at the wireless edge. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by\nleveraging the structured knowledge of wireless problems -- specifically,\npermutation equivariant (PE) properties. We design three types of PE-aware\nmodules, two of which are Transformer-style sub-layers. These modules can serve\nas building blocks to assemble compact DNNs applicable to the wireless policies\nwith various PE properties. To guide the design, we analyze the hypothesis\nspace associated with each PE property, and show that the PE-structured module\nassembly can boost the learning efficiency. Inspired by the reusability of the\nmodules, we propose PE-MoFormer, a compositional DNN capable of learning a wide\nrange of wireless policies -- including but not limited to precoding,\ncoordinated beamforming, power allocation, and channel estimation -- with\nstrong generalizability, low sample and space complexity. Simulations\ndemonstrate that the proposed modular PE-based framework outperforms relevant\nlarge model in both learning efficiency and inference time, offering a new\ndirection for structured cross-task learning for wireless communications."}

We formulate a problem to maximize the worst-case sensing\nperformance by jointly designing the beamforming at the base station and the\nphase shifts at the RIS, while guaranteeing communication rates.

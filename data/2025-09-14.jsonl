In this study, we introduce the SNUPHY-M (Seoul\nNational University hospital PHYsiological signal Masked representation\nlearning) model extracts physiological features reflecting the electrical,\npressure, and fluid characteristics of the cardiac cycle in the process of\nrestoring three masked physiological signals based on self-supervised learning\n(SSL): ECG, PPG, and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. By employing\nmultiple physical characteristics, the model can extract more enriched features\nonly using non-invasive signals. We evaluated the model's performance in\nclinical downstream tasks such as hypotension, stroke volume, systolic blood\npressure, diastolic blood pressure, and age prediction. Our results showed that\nthe SNUPHY-M significantly outperformed supervised or SSL models, especially in\nprediction tasks using non-invasive signals.

Real-world audio, however, often contains mixed speech and background\nsounds, and downstream tasks require selective access to these components.\nTherefore, we rethink the audio codec as a universal disentangled\nrepresentation learner to enable controllable feature selection across\ndifferent audio tasks. To this end, we introduce DeCodec, a novel neural codec\nthat learns to decouple audio representations into orthogonal subspaces\ndedicated to speech and background sound, and within speech, representations\nare further decomposed into semantic and paralinguistic components. This\nhierarchical disentanglement allows flexible feature selection, making DeCodec\na universal front-end for multiple audio applications. Technically, built upon\na codec framework, DeCodec incorporates two key innovations: a subspace\northogonal projection module that factorizes the input into two decoupled\northogonal subspaces, and a representation swap training procedure that ensures\nthese two subspaces are correlate to the speech and background sound,\nrespectively. These allows parallel RVQs to quantize speech and background\nsound components independently.

These models, however, fail to deal with\nthe whole piece at once due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention\nmechanism, and music signals are thus typically processed in a sliding-window\nmanner in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient\narchitecture with sparse attention mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce\nsliding-window self-attention mechanisms for both the encoder and decoder, and\na hybrid global-local cross-attention mechanism that attends to various spans\naccording to the MIDI token types. We also use a hierarchical pooling strategy\nbetween the encoder and decoder to further reduce computational load. Our\nexperiments on the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed model achieved a\nsignificant reduction in computational cost and memory usage, accelerating\ninference speed, while maintaining transcription performance comparable to the\nfull-attention baseline. This allows for training with longer audio contexts on\nthe same hardware, demonstrating the viability of sparse attention for building\nefficient and high-performance piano transcription systems.

Discrete codec representations have\nbeen widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to\nexplore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential\nof discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing\nflow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous\nspace and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the\nadvantages of discrete representations.

The presence of artifacts can\nsignificantly degrade EEG data quality, complicating analysis and potentially\nleading to erroneous interpretations. While various artifact rejection methods\nhave been proposed, the gold standard remains manual visual inspection by human\nexperts-a process that is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for\nlarge-scale EEG studies. Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong\nreliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high\ncomputational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato\nField (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that\naddresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against\nseveral state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly\navailable EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG\nrecordings. Our results demonstrate that iRPF outperforms all competitors\nacross multiple metrics, with gains of up to 22% in recall, 102% in\nspecificity, 54% in precision, and 24% in F1-score, compared to Isolation\nForest, Autoreject, Riemannian Potato, and Riemannian Potato Field,\nrespectively.

We\nintroduce the Perceptual Separation (PS) and Perceptual Match (PM), the first\npair of measures that functionally isolate these two factors. Our intrusive\nmethod begins with generating a bank of fundamental distortions for each\nreference waveform signal in the mixture. Distortions, references, and their\nrespective system outputs from all sources are then independently encoded by a\npre-trained self-supervised learning model. These representations are\naggregated and projected onto a manifold via diffusion maps, which aligns\nEuclidean distances on the manifold with dissimilarities of the encoded\nwaveforms. On this manifold, the PM measures the Mahalanobis distance from each\noutput to its attributed cluster that consists of its reference and distortions\nembeddings, capturing self-distortion. The PS accounts for the Mahalanobis\ndistance of the output to the attributed and to the closest non-attributed\nclusters, quantifying leakage. Both measures are differentiable and granular,\noperating at a resolution as low as 50 frames per second. We further derive,\nfor both measures, deterministic error radius and non-asymptotic,\nhigh-probability confidence intervals (CIs). Experiments on English, Spanish,\nand music mixtures show that the PS and PM nearly always achieve the highest\nlinear correlation coefficients with human mean-opinion scores than 14\ncompetitors, reaching as high as 86.36% for speech and 87.21% for music.

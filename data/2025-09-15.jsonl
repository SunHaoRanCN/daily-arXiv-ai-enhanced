Developing\naccurate and reliable ML models depends on access to high-quality, annotated\ndata, a resource in short supply. ML competitions address this need by\nproviding researchers access to expertly annotated datasets, fostering shared\nlearning through direct model comparisons, and leveraging the benefits of\ncrowdsourcing diverse expertise. We compiled a retrospective dataset containing\n353 hours of EEG from 102 individual newborns from a multi-centre study. The\ndata was fully anonymised and divided into training, testing, and held-out\nvalidation datasets. EEGs were graded for the severity of abnormal background\npatterns. Next, we created a web-based competition platform and hosted a\nmachine learning competition to develop ML models for classifying the severity\nof EEG background patterns in newborns. After the competition closed, the top 4\nperforming models were evaluated offline on a separate held-out validation\ndataset. Although a feature-based model ranked first on the testing dataset,\ndeep learning models generalised better on the validation sets. All methods had\na significant decline in validation performance compared to the testing\nperformance. This highlights the challenges for model generalisation on unseen\ndata, emphasising the need for held-out validation datasets in ML studies with\nneonatal EEG. The study underscores the importance of training ML models on\nlarge and diverse datasets to ensure robust generalisation. The competition's\noutcome demonstrates the potential for open-access data and collaborative ML\ndevelopment to foster a collaborative research environment and expedite the\ndevelopment of clinical decision-support tools for neonatal neuromonitoring."}

However, when the target signal\nlacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies,\ntraining suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to\nreconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie\nwithin the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in\nthe context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal\nrepresentation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting\nhigh-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To\neffectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we\npropose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER -\nweight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network\ninitialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian\nnoise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral\ncentroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide\ncontrol over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the\nempirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral\nbottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation\naccuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and\nachieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks.

However, when the target signal\nlacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies,\ntraining suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to\nreconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie\nwithin the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in\nthe context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal\nrepresentation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting\nhigh-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To\neffectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we\npropose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER -\nweight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network\ninitialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian\nnoise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral\ncentroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide\ncontrol over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the\nempirical neural tangent kernel.

Our method allows flexible modulation between generation\nquality and computational efficiency through adjustable compression thresholds.\nExperimental evaluations conducted on F5-TTS and MegaTTS 3 demonstrate that\nDiTReducio achieves a 75.4% reduction in FLOPs and improves the Real-Time\nFactor (RTF) by 37.1%, while preserving generation quality."}

Yet, many of the existing techniques\nremain heavily influenced by classical methods. While this inductive bias may\nease the system design, our work aims to develop a more generic front-end for\nfeature extraction. Furthermore, we seek to unify the front-end architecture\ncontrasting with existing approaches that apply a composition of several layer\ntopologies originating from different sources. The experiments systematically\nshow how to reduce the influence of existing techniques to achieve a generic\nfront-end. The resulting 2D convolutional front-end is parameter-efficient and\nsuitable for a scenario with limited computational resources unlike large\nmodels pre-trained on unlabeled audio. The results demonstrate that this\ngeneric unified approach is not only feasible but also matches the performance\nof existing supervised learnable feature extractors."}

This\npaper presents a novel dual pipeline machine learning framework that classifies\npilot radio communications using both textual and spectral features. Audio data\ncollected from a non-towered U.S. airport was annotated by certified pilots\nwith operational intent labels and preprocessed through automatic speech\nrecognition and Mel-spectrogram extraction. We evaluate a wide range of\ntraditional classifiers and deep learning models, including ensemble methods,\nLSTM, and CNN across both pipelines. To our knowledge, this is the first system\nto classify operational aircraft intent using a dual-pipeline ML framework on\nreal-world air traffic audio. Our results demonstrate that spectral features\ncombined with deep architectures consistently yield superior classification\nperformance, with F1-scores exceeding 91%. Data augmentation further improves\nrobustness to real-world audio variability. The proposed approach is scalable,\ncost-effective, and deployable without additional infrastructure, offering a\npractical solution for air traffic monitoring at general aviation airports."}

Still, challenges remain that limit its performance. In this\nwork, we extend a previously proposed framework for analyzing leakage in speech\nseparation with proper sensitivity to temporal locality. We show that there is\nsignificant leakage to the cross channel in areas where only the primary\nspeaker is active. At the same time, the results demonstrate that this does not\naffect the final performance much as these leaked parts are largely ignored by\nthe voice activity detection (VAD). Furthermore, different segmentations are\ncompared showing that advanced diarization approaches are able to reduce the\ngap to oracle segmentation by a third compared to a simple energy-based VAD. We\nadditionally reveal what factors contribute to the remaining difference. The\nresults represent state-of-the-art performance on LibriCSS among systems that\ntrain the recognition module on LibriSpeech data only."}

However, existing autoencoders often\nforce a choice between continuous embeddings and discrete tokens. Furthermore,\nachieving high compression ratios while maintaining audio fidelity remains a\nchallenge. We introduce CoDiCodec, a novel audio autoencoder that overcomes\nthese limitations by both efficiently encoding global features via summary\nembeddings, and by producing both compressed continuous embeddings at ~ 11 Hz\nand discrete tokens at a rate of 2.38 kbps from the same trained model,\noffering unprecedented flexibility for different downstream generative tasks.\nThis is achieved through Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and a novel\nFSQ-dropout technique, and does not require additional loss terms beyond the\nsingle consistency loss used for end-to-end training. CoDiCodec supports both\nautoregressive decoding and a novel parallel decoding strategy, with the latter\nachieving superior audio quality and faster decoding. CoDiCodec outperforms\nexisting continuous and discrete autoencoders at similar bitrates in terms of\nreconstruction audio quality. Our work enables a unified approach to audio\ncompression, bridging the gap between continuous and discrete generative\nmodelling paradigms."}

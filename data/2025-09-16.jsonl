Our preprocessing module tokenizes radar sequence features,\napplies a patch selection algorithm to filter out uninformative segments, and\nprojects the selected patches into embeddings compatible with the feature space\nof pre-trained LLMs. Leveraging these refined embeddings, we incorporate a\npre-trained LLM, fine-tuning only the normalization layers to reduce training\nburdens while enhancing performance. Experiments on measured datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines on supervised learning tests."}

Early detection is\ncritical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods.\nDeep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds\nindicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However,\nstate-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited\navailability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and\npre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling\ntransformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines\ntraditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and\nDiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based\nclassifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach\nachieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC)\n2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR),\nsensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach\n92.48\\%, 93.05\\%, 93.63\\%, 92.48\\%, 94.93\\% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the\nsynchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14\\%,\n92.21\\%, 94.35\\%, 90.10\\%, 95.12\\% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR,\nsensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset\nconsisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13\\% accuracy, 74.25\\% UAR,\n86.47\\% sensitivity, 62.04\\% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection\nwhen supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance\nmultimodal and multichannel heart sound classification."}

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种集成系统，结合医疗设备、移动应用和机器学习技术，为资源突出地区的早产儿提供连续生命体征监测，支持袍鼠母亲护理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Premature infant mortality remains a critical challenge in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs), with continuous vital sign monitoring being
essential for early detection of life-threatening conditions. This paper
presents an integrated system combining NeoWarm, a novel biomedical device,
with NeoRoo, a mobile application, and NeoSmartML, a machine learning
infrastructure, to enable comprehensive vital sign monitoring during Kangaroo
Mother Care (KMC). Our power-optimized device achieves 6-6.5 days of continuous
operation on a single charge, while the mobile application implements an
offline-first architecture with efficient data synchronization. The optical
character recognition pipeline demonstrates promising accuracy (F1 scores
0.78-0.875) for automated vital sign extraction from existing NICU monitors.
Experimental validation shows the system's feasibility for deployment in
resource-constrained settings, though further optimization of heart rate and
temperature detection, along with the risk classification foundation model is
needed.

### [2] [Distributed Gossip-GAN for Low-overhead CSI Feedback Training in FDD mMIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10490)
*Yuwen Cao,Guijun Liu,Tomoaki Ohtsuki,Howard H. Yang,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于Gossip-GAN的分布式CSI反馈训练框架，解决传统深度自编码器在大规模MIMO系统中数据隐私、带宽消耗和灾难性遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DAE方法需要基站收集大量数据进行集中训练，导致带宽消耗大、隐私泄露风险高，且在用户移动和新信道环境下需要重新训练模型，存在灾难性遗忘问题

Method: 使用生成对抗网络(GAN)，每个用户收集少量数据训练本地GAN模型，采用完全分布式gossip-learning策略避免过拟合并加速训练

Result: 仿真结果表明：1)达到与集中式训练相当的CSI反馈精度 2)解决移动场景中的灾难性遗忘问题 3)大幅减少上行带宽使用 4)具有内在鲁棒性

Conclusion: Gossip-GAN框架在保护用户隐私的同时实现了低开销的CSI反馈训练，有效解决了传统方法的局限性

Abstract: The deep autoencoder (DAE) framework has turned out to be efficient in
reducing the channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive
multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) systems. However, these DAE approaches
presented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the
base station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage
and data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering
users' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI
feedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous
environments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk
of catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose
a novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI
feedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback
training with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each
user collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully
distributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting,
and to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate
that Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized
training with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting
challenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth
usage. Besides, our results show that the proposed approach possesses an
inherent robustness.

### [3] [FlowECG: Using Flow Matching to Create a More Efficient ECG Signal Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10491)
*Vitalii Bondar,Serhii Semenov,Vira Babenko,Dmytro Holovniak*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: FlowECG是一种基于流匹配的心电图生成方法，相比扩散模型大幅减少计算需求，在保持生成质量的同时将采样步骤从200步降至10-25步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于扩散模型的ECG生成方法计算成本高、采样步骤多的问题，使其更适合临床部署和实时应用。

Method: 采用流匹配方法替代迭代扩散过程，通过常微分方程求解学习从噪声到数据分布的直接传输路径，基于SSSD-ECG架构进行改进。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上，FlowECG在10-25次神经网络评估下达到与200步扩散方法相当的性能，在三个指标上超越基线，计算需求降低一个数量级。

Conclusion: FlowECG通过流匹配技术实现了高效的心电图生成，在保持生理真实性的同时大幅提升计算效率，适合资源有限的临床环境部署。

Abstract: Synthetic electrocardiogram generation serves medical AI applications
requiring privacy-preserving data sharing and training dataset augmentation.
Current diffusion-based methods achieve high generation quality but require
hundreds of neural network evaluations during sampling, creating computational
bottlenecks for clinical deployment. We propose FlowECG, a flow matching
approach that adapts the SSSD-ECG architecture by replacing the iterative
diffusion process with continuous flow dynamics. Flow matching learns direct
transport paths from noise to data distributions through ordinary differential
equation solving. We evaluate our method on the PTB-XL dataset using Dynamic
Time Warping, Wasserstein distance, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and spectral
similarity metrics. FlowECG matches SSSD-ECG performance at 200 neural function
evaluations, outperforming the baseline on three metrics. The key finding shows
that FlowECG maintains generation quality with substantially fewer sampling
steps, achieving comparable results with 10-25 evaluations compared to 200 for
diffusion methods. This efficiency improvement reduces computational
requirements by an order of magnitude while preserving physiologically
realistic 12-lead ECG characteristics. The approach enables practical
deployment in resource-limited clinical settings where real-time generation or
large-scale synthetic data creation is needed.

### [4] [Uplink and Downlink Communications in Segmented Waveguide-Enabled Pinching-Antenna Systems (SWANs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10666)
*Chongjun Ouyang,Hao Jiang,Zhaolin Wang,Yuanwei Liu,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种分段导波管启用的拉拉天线系统(SWAN)，通过多个短仅电导波段构成分段导波管来消除天线间辐射干扰，并提出三种操作协议，在上行和下行通信中都显著提高了信噪比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的拉拉天线系统(PASS)使用单个长导波管存在天线间辐射干扰问题，导致信号模型复杂且无法建立物理一致的上行信号模型。需要一种新的架构来解决这些限制。

Method: 设计了分段导波管架构，每个段部署拉拉天线。提出三种操作协议：段选择(SS)、段聚合(SA)和段复用(SM)。开发了天线部署算法来最大化信噪比，并对三种协议进行了收到信噪比的闭式表达式和缩放规律分析。

Result: 数值结果显示：1)在三种协议中，SM协议表现最佳，其次是SA和SS；2)在所有协议下，提出的SWAN系统在上行和下行场景中都比传统单长导波管PASS获得更高的信噪比。

Conclusion: 分段导波管架构能够有效消除天线间辐射干扰，建立了物理一致的信号模型，通过减少天线到用户距离和天线到供电距离，同时减轻大规模路径损耗和导波管传播损耗，显著提高了系统性能。

Abstract: A segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) is proposed, in
which a segmented waveguide composed of multiple short dielectric waveguide
segments is employed to radiate or receive signals through the pinching
antennas (PAs) deployed on each segment. Based on this architecture, three
practical operating protocols are proposed: segment selection (SS), segment
aggregation (SA), and segment multiplexing (SM). For uplink SWAN
communications, where one PA is activated per segment, the segmented structure
eliminates the inter-antenna radiation effect, i.e., signals captured by one PA
may re-radiate through other PAs along the same waveguide. This yields a
tractable and physically consistent uplink signal model for a multi-PA
pinching-antenna system (PASS), which has not been established for conventional
PASS using a single long waveguide. Building on this model, PA placement
algorithms are proposed to maximize the uplink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Closed-form expressions for the received SNR under the three protocols are
derived, and the corresponding scaling laws with respect to the number of
segments are analyzed. It is proven that the segmented architecture reduces
both the average PA-to-user distance and the PA-to-feed distance, thereby
mitigating both large-scale path loss and in-waveguide propagation loss. These
results are extended to downlink SWAN communications, where multiple PAs are
activated per segment, and PA placement methods are proposed to maximize the
downlink received SNR under the three protocols. Numerical results demonstrate
that: \romannumeral1) among the three protocols, SM achieves the best
performance, followed by SA and then SS; and \romannumeral2) for all protocols,
the proposed SWAN achieves a higher SNR than conventional PASS with a single
long waveguide in both uplink and downlink scenarios.

### [5] [Quasi-Deterministic Modeling of Sub-THz Band Access Channels in Street Canyon Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10752)
*Minseok Kim,Masato Yomoda,Minghe Mao,Nobuaki Kuno,Koshiro Kitao,Satoshi Suyama*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文通过实际港道测量研究了154GHz和300GHz频段在街道峡谷环境下的传播特性，建立了准确的次太赫系统通信港道模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 次太赫频段（100-300GHz）在B5G/6G网络中具有重要作用，但需要新的港道模型来描述其几何光学传播特性，而非简单外推现有模型

Method: 在户外街道峡谷环境中进行双向港道测量，包括LoS和NLoS条件，使用自行开发的港道详查仪。通过聚类分析识别多路径聚类，并提出准确定性港道模型

Result: 获得了频率依赖性聚类特征、大规模参数（路径损耗、延迟扩散、角度扩散、Rician K因子）等关键数据，建立了结合确定性和随机成分的港道模型

Conclusion: 该研究为次太赫频段在城市街道峡谷中的传播特性提供了重要见解，有助于发展准确的6G系统港道模型

Abstract: Sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies (100--300 GHz) are expected to play a key
role in beyond-5G and 6G mobile networks. However, their quasi-optical
propagation characteristics require new channel models beyond sub-100 GHz
extrapolations. This paper presents an extensive double-directional (D-D)
channel measurement campaign conducted in an outdoor street-canyon environment
at 154 GHz and 300 GHz under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) conditions using an in-house-developed channel sounder. Based on these
measurements, clustering with merged datasets across the two frequencies
enables comparative analyses that identify both common and distinct multipath
clusters, as well as the frequency dependence of cluster-level characteristics.
A quasi-deterministic (QD) channel model is then proposed, combining
deterministic components, such as LoS and single-bounce reflections from side
walls, with random components. Large-scale parameters (path loss, delay spread,
angular spread, and Rician K-factor) are also evaluated. These results provide
valuable insights into sub-THz propagation in urban street canyons and
contribute toward the development of accurate, channel models for future 6G
systems.

### [6] [Hybrid Atomic Norm Sparse/Diffuse Channel Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10770)
*Lei Lyu,Urbashi Mitra*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出频域混合稀疏/扩散信道模型，设计HALS算法估计稀疏和扩散分量，提供理论分析和性能边界，通过仿真验证方法有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于对信道中可解析路径和扩散散射统计的结构分析，需要开发能够同时处理稀疏和扩散分量的信道估计方法

Method: 设计混合原子最小二乘(HALS)算法，结合原子和l2正则化来估计稀疏/扩散分量，提供理论对偶问题分析和最优频率支持估计算法

Result: 数值仿真在合成数据和真实实验数据上验证了方法的有效性，展示了信道特性（稀疏路径和扩散分量相对能量）与性能之间的权衡关系

Conclusion: 提出的HSD信道模型和HALS算法能够有效估计信道中的稀疏和扩散分量，理论分析和性能边界为方法提供了坚实基础

Abstract: In this paper, the hybrid sparse/diffuse (HSD) channel model in frequency
domain is proposed. Based on the structural analysis on the resolvable paths
and diffuse scattering statistics in the channel, the Hybrid
Atomic-Least-Squares (HALS) algorithm is designed to estimate sparse/diffuse
components with a combined atomic and l2 regularization. A theoretical analysis
is conducted on the Lagrangian dual problem and the conditions needed to be
satisfied by primal and dual solutions are provided. This analysis, in turn,
suggests an algorithm for optimal frequency support estimation. Debiased
methods for improved channel estimation are provided. Given differing amounts
of side information, performance bounds are derived in terms of a genie-aided
estimator and constrained Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB). Numerical results via
simulations on synthetic data as well as real experimental data validate the
efficacy of the proposed method. There are clear tradeoffs with respect to the
properties of the channel with respect to performance: sparsity of specular
paths and relative energy of diffuse components.

*Maya Mekel,Vered Karp,Satish Mulleti,Alejandro Cohen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种自标定集成-攻击时间编码机器(S-IF-TEM)，能够在采样过程中同时进行参数估计和信号重建，有效减少设备不匹配影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IF-TEM模型忽略了设备不匹配和不完美性，导致重建错误，需要一种更实际的模型来处理参数不确定性、时间变化和非线性运行情况。

Method: 在新的实用IF-TEM(P-IF-TEM)设置上开发自标定框架，考虑了系统参数不准确、积分器放电时间变化和非线性运行区域等实际问题，并推导了采样率边界和重建条件。

Result: 分析结果确立了自标定下完美重建的条件，评估研究显示性能提升超过59dB，显著提高了重建质量。

Conclusion: 该方法通过同时进行参数估计和信号重建，有效减少了实际设备不匹配带来的影响，为实际应用提供了更加稳健和准确的采样方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel self-calibrating integrate-and-fire time
encoding machine (S-IF-TEM) that enables simultaneous parameter estimation and
signal reconstruction during sampling, thereby effectively mitigating mismatch
effects. The proposed framework is developed over a new practical IF-TEM
(P-IF-TEM) setting, which extends classical models by incorporating device
mismatches and imperfections that can otherwise lead to significant
reconstruction errors. Unlike existing IF-TEM settings, P-IF-TEM accounts for
scenarios where (i) system parameters are inaccurately known and may vary over
time, (ii) the integrator discharge time after firings can vary, and (iii) the
sampler may operate in its nonlinear region under large input dynamic ranges.
For this practical model, we derive sampling rate bounds and reconstruction
conditions that ensure perfect recovery. Analytical results establish the
conditions for perfect reconstruction under self-calibration, and evaluation
studies demonstrate substantial improvements - exceeding 59dB - highlighting
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### [8] [Landscape Analysis of Simultaneous Blind Deconvolution and Phase Retrieval via Structured Low-Rank Tensor Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10834)
*Xiao Liang,Zhen Qin,Zhihui Zhu,Shuang Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文通过结构化低秩张量恢复框架对同时盲解卷积和相位恢复(BDPR)问题进行几何分析，提出了一个可处理的张量感知问题作为替代模型，并证明了黎曼梯度下降的线性收敛性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于BDPR问题中传感张量的结构极其复杂，直接分析其优化景观是不可行的，需要找到一个既能保留关键结构特征又便于理论分析的替代模型。

Method: 引入张量感知问题作为替代模型，研究对应的群体风险，分析单位球面上的全局景观，证明黎曼梯度下降(RGD)在温和条件下的线性收敛性，并扩展到带噪声的测量场景。

Result: 理论分析表明RGD能够线性收敛，且在测量噪声下具有鲁棒性，数值实验进一步支持了理论结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为结构化低秩张量恢复问题的优化景观提供了基础性见解，这些见解等价地表征了原始BDPR问题，为解决原始BDPR问题提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: This paper presents a geometric analysis of the simultaneous blind
deconvolution and phase retrieval (BDPR) problem via a structured low-rank
tensor recovery framework. Due to the highly complicated structure of the
associated sensing tensor, directly characterizing its optimization landscape
is intractable. To address this, we introduce a tensor sensing problem as a
tractable surrogate that preserves the essential structural features of the
target low-rank tensor while enabling rigorous theoretical analysis. As a first
step toward understanding this surrogate model, we study the corresponding
population risk, which captures key aspects of the underlying low-rank tensor
structure. We characterize the global landscape of the population risk on the
unit sphere and show that Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) converges linearly
under mild conditions. We then extend the analysis to the tensor sensing
problem, establishing local geometric properties, proving convergence
guarantees for RGD, and quantifying robustness under measurement noise. Our
theoretical results are further supported by extensive numerical experiments.
These findings offer foundational insights into the optimization landscape of
the structured low-rank tensor recovery problem, which equivalently
characterizes the original BDPR problem, thereby providing principled guidance
for solving the original BDPR problem.

*Hugues Kouakou,José Henrique de Morais Goulart,Raffaele Vitale,Thomas Oberlin,David Rousseau,Cyril Ruckebusch,Nicolas Dobigeon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MVCU算法的在线SSMF方法，通过只在必要时更新解来降低计算成本，同时保持与离线方法相当的估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MVCU算法在在线场景中的可扩展性限制，包括内存和计算需求过高的问题。

Method: 基于现成的MVCU算法构建顺序处理框架，只在必要时更新解，仅存储和处理对SSMF几何约束具有信息量的观测数据。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证有效，达到与离线MVCU方法相当的估计精度，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将MVCU算法扩展到在线场景，在保持性能的同时大幅提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF) is a common task encountered
in signal processing and machine learning. Minimum-volume constrained unmixing
(MVCU) algorithms are among the most widely used methods to perform this task.
While MVCU algorithms generally perform well in an offline setting, their
direct application to online scenarios suffers from scalability limitations due
to memory and computational demands. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an approach which can build upon any off-the-shelf MVCU algorithm to
operate sequentially, i.e., to handle one observation at a time. The key idea
of the proposed method consists in updating the solution of MVCU only when
necessary, guided by an online check of the corresponding optimization problem
constraints. It only stores and processes observations identified as
informative with respect to the geometrical constraints underlying SSMF. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach when analyzing synthetic and real
datasets, showing that it achieves estimation accuracy comparable to the
offline MVCU method upon which it relies, while significantly reducing the
computational cost.

*Yekta Demirci,Guillaume Mantelet,Stéphane Martel,Jean-François Frigon,Gunes Karabulut Kurt*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 使用变压器模型预测低地轨道卫星网络的用户流量需求，在某些流量条件下比传统FARIMA模型提高6%预测准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地轨道卫星网络需要预测用户流量需求以支持动态束突跳技术，但FARIMA模型在卫星载载处理能力受限和需要为每个序列重新调整模型的问题下，需要寻找替代方案

Method: 采用预训练的概率性时间序列模型，利用变压器结构和Prob-Sparse自注意力机制，在不同时间粒度和序列长度下进行测试

Result: 进行了涉及广泛的模拟实验，变压器基模型在某些流量条件下使用均方误差作为性能指标时，实现了最高达6%的预测准确性提升

Conclusion: 变压器基模型作为一种替代方案，在低地轨道卫星网络的用户流量需求预测中显示出良好的性能，适合在载载处理能力受限的环境中应用

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the use of a transformer-based model to address the
need for forecasting user traffic demand in the next generation Low Earth Orbit
(LEO) satellite networks. Considering a LEO satellite constellation, we present
the need to forecast the demand for the satellites in-orbit to utilize dynamic
beam-hopping in high granularity. We adopt a traffic dataset with second-order
self-similar characteristics. Given this traffic dataset, the Fractional
Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (FARIMA) model is considered a
benchmark forecasting solution. However, the constrained on-board processing
capabilities of LEO satellites, combined with the need to fit a new model for
each input sequence due to the nature of FARIMA, motivate the investigation of
alternative solutions. As an alternative, a pretrained probabilistic time
series model that utilizes transformers with a Prob-Sparse self-attention
mechanism is considered. The considered solution is investigated under
different time granularities with varying sequence and prediction lengths.
Concluding this paper, we provide extensive simulation results where the
transformer-based solution achieved up to six percent better forecasting
accuracy on certain traffic conditions using mean squared error as the
performance indicator.

Abstract: This work presents a first-of-its-kind graphical user interface (GUI)-based
simulator developed using MATLAB App designer for the comprehensive analysis of
sparse linear arrays (SLAs) in the difference coarray (DCA) domain. Sparse
sensor arrays have emerged as a critical solution in enhancing signal
detection, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, and beamforming in fields
such as wireless communication, radar, sonar, and integrated sensing systems.
They offer several advantages over traditional uniform arrays, including
reduced system complexity, lower deployment costs, and improved mitigation of
mutual coupling effects. The tool enables users to input array configurations,
compute DCAs, visualize weight function graphs, and assess the hole-free status
of arrays, as applicable for coarray processing. Unlike conventional simulators
that focus on radiation pattern visualization (array pattern, main lobe and
sidelobe characteristics, azimuth cut, rectangular view, polar view etc.), this
tool addresses the behavior of SLAs from a coarray domain perspective.
Numerical validations demonstrate the tool's correctness, effectiveness, and
its potential to foster further research in sparse arrays. This simulator could
also be used as a teaching aid to drive home complicated topics and attract
young minds towards the fascinating field of sparse array design.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了可重构智能表面(RIS)技术中的信道互易性攻击(CRACK)威胁，提出了基于深度强化学习的SecureCoder防御框架来对抗这种攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RIS技术虽然能提升无线通信性能，但也引入了新的安全漏洞。特别是基于非互易RIS(NR-RIS)的信道互易性攻击，能够在不需要额外信号传输或信道状态信息的情况下破坏下行链路预编码，威胁通信安全。

Method: 提出了SecureCoder框架，这是一个基于深度强化学习的解决方案，利用估计的上行链路CSI和用户速率反馈来优化下行预编码矩阵，从而缓解CRACK攻击。

Result: 仿真结果表明NR-RIS CRACK会造成严重的性能下降，而SecureCoder能够有效提高吞吐量并降低安全威胁，增强系统鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NR-RIS CRACK是一种隐蔽且有效的攻击方式，而基于深度强化学习的SecureCoder框架为对抗此类攻击提供了有效的防御手段，显著提升了系统的安全性能。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology enhances wireless
communication performance, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities that can
be exploited by adversaries. This paper investigates channel reciprocity attack
(CRACK) threats in multi-antenna wireless systems operating in time-division
duplexing mode using a physically consistent non-reciprocal RIS (NR-RIS) model.
CRACK can degrade communication rate and facilitate passive eavesdropping
behavior by distorting the downlink precoding, without requiring any additional
signal transmission or channel state information (CSI). Unlike conventional RIS
jamming strategies, the NR-RIS does not need synchronization with the
legitimate system and thus can operate with slow or fixed configurations to
implement CRACK, obscuring the distinction between the direct and RIS-induced
channels and thereby complicating corresponding defensive precoding designs. To
counter the CRACK threat posed by NR-RIS, we develop ``SecureCoder,'' a deep
reinforcement learning-based framework that can mitigate CRACK and determine an
improved downlink precoder matrix using the estimated uplink CSI and rate
feedback from the users. Simulation results demonstrate the severe performance
degradation caused by NR-RIS CRACK and validate the effectiveness of
SecureCoder in improving both throughput and reducing security threats, thereby
enhancing system robustness.

Abstract: Revolutionizing communication architectures to achieve a balance between
enhanced performance and improved efficiency is becoming increasingly critical
for wireless communications as the era of ultra-large-scale arrays approaches.
In traditional communication architectures, radio frequency (RF) signals are
typically converted to baseband for subsequent processing through operations
such as filtering, analog-to-digital conversion and down-conversion, all of
which depend on expensive and power-intensive RF chains. The increased hardware
complexity and escalated power consumption resulting from this dependency
significantly limit the practical deployment of ultra-large-scale arrays. To
address these limitations, we propose a holographic communication system based
on the principle of interferometry, designated as holographic interference
surfaces (HIS). Utilizing the interference effect of electromagnetic waves, HIS
estimates the channel state information (CSI) by dealing solely with power
information, which enables the replacement of RF chains with power sensors and
completes the signal processing in radio frequency. As proof-of-concept
demonstrations, we implemented a prototype system based on principles of
holographic interference. Experimental results align well with theoretical
predictions, confirming the practical viability and effectiveness of the
proposed HIS. This work provides a new paradigm for building a more
cost-effective wireless communication architecture.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的JSCC方法将通信系统过度简化为带噪声的管道，未能考虑无线信道的复杂动态特性和具体物理层传输过程

Method: 基于Swin Transformer骨干网络，设计SoM赋能的动态信道自适应传输(DCAT)方案，有效利用无线信道的物理层传输特性来适应时变衰落和信道老化效应

Result: DCAT在所有条件下都优于JSCC基线方法，神经网络架构具有高度可扩展性和可解释性设计

Conclusion: DCAT方案在实际通信场景中具有实用价值，为实际应用中的成本效益部署提供了巨大潜力

Abstract: Wireless image transmission underpins diverse networked intelligent services
and becomes an increasingly critical issue. Existing works have shown that deep
learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is an effective framework to
balance image transmission fidelity and data overhead. However, these studies
oversimplify the communication system as a mere pipeline with noise, failing to
account for the complex dynamics of wireless channels and concrete
physical-layer transmission process. To address these limitations, we propose a
Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-empowered Dynamic Channel Adaptive Transmission
(DCAT) scheme, designed for practical implementation in real communication
scenarios. Building upon the Swin Transformer backbone, our DCAT scheme
demonstrates robust adaptability to time-selective fading and channel aging
effects by effectively utilizing the physical-layer transmission
characteristics of wireless channels. Comprehensive experimental results
confirm that DCAT consistently achieves superior performance compared with JSCC
baseline approaches across all conditions. Furthermore, our neural network
architecture demonstrates high scalability due to its interpretable design,
offering substantial potential for cost-efficient deployment in practical
applications.

Method: 采用电阻跳变(RH)方案并添加偏置，使用最大似然(ML)检测器，研究高斯分布的可分离性条件，提供基于阈值的最优检测器

Result: 仿真结果显示相比经典KLJN方案，提出的RH-KLJN方案具有更高的数据速率和更低的误码率，但复杂度有所增加

Conclusion: 提出的RH-KLJN通信方案在保持安全性的同时显著提高了通信性能，为物理层安全通信提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, a Resistor Hopping (RH) scheme with the addition of biases is
proposed for secure Kirchhoff Law Johnson-Noise (KLJN) communication. The RH
approach enables us to increase the bit rate of secure communication between
Alice and Bob, while also ensuring that the inherent unconditional security of
KLJN is satisfied. The biases are added to the proposed scheme to better
distinguish between Gaussian distributed noises in terms of their means, rather
than just using variances. Throughout the paper, we strive to minimize biases
to achieve a power-efficient scheme. For the detection part of the proposed
algorithm, a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector is derived. The separability
condition of Gaussian distributions is investigated, along with the provision
of a threshold-based detector that offers both simple and optimal thresholds in
terms of minimizing the error probability. Some analysis of the proposed
RH-KLJN communication scheme is provided, including Physical Layer Security
(PLS) equations. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
scheme over the classical KLJN scheme, offering a higher data rate and lower
bit error probability at the expense of increased complexity.

Conclusion: GQNM框架成功将噪声调制扩展到非高斯分布和双维度，实现了数据率翻倍和性能提升，为低功耗安全通信系统提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: This letter generalizes noise modulation by introducing two voltage biases
and employing non-Gaussian noise distributions, such as Mixture of Gaussian
(MoG) and Laplacian, in addition to traditional Gaussian noise. The proposed
framework doubles the data rate by enabling discrimination in both the mean and
variance of transmitted noise symbols. This novel modulation scheme is referred
to as Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulation (GQNM). Closed-form expressions
for the Bit Error Probability (BEP) are derived for the Generalized Gaussian
(GG) and Gaussian Mixture of Two Gaussians (GMoTG) cases. Simulation results
demonstrate the advantages of the generalized modulation scheme, particularly
under non-Gaussian noise assumptions, highlighting its potential for enhanced
performance in low-power and secure communication systems.

Motivation: 从低阶矩恢复信号是逆问题中的一个基本但困难的挑战，通常需要求解病态的多项式方程组。传统方法在高噪声环境下效果有限，需要新的正则化技术来稳定恢复过程。

Conclusion: 该研究为生成先验与非线性多项式逆问题的结合开辟了有前景的新方向，证明了扩散模型在稳定多项式恢复方面的有效性。

Abstract: Recovering signals from low-order moments is a fundamental yet notoriously
difficult task in inverse problems. This recovery process often reduces to
solving ill-conditioned systems of polynomial equations. In this work, we
propose a new framework that integrates score-based diffusion priors with
moment-based estimators to regularize and solve these nonlinear inverse
problems. This introduces a new role for generative models: stabilizing
polynomial recovery from noisy statistical features. As a concrete application,
we study the multi-target detection (MTD) model in the high-noise regime. We
demonstrate two main results: (i) diffusion priors substantially improve
recovery from third-order moments, and (ii) they make the super-resolution MTD
problem, otherwise ill-posed, feasible. Numerical experiments on MNIST data
confirm consistent gains in reconstruction accuracy across SNR levels. Our
results suggest a promising new direction for combining generative priors with
nonlinear polynomial inverse problems.

Abstract: Infrastructure-mounted sensors can capture rich environmental information to
enhance communications and facilitate beamforming in millimeter-wave systems.
This work presents an efficient sensing-assisted long-term beam tracking
framework that selects optimal beams from a codebook for current and multiple
future time slots. We first design a large attention-enhanced neural network
(NN) to fully exploit past visual observations for beam tracking. A
convolutional NN extracts compact image features, while gated recurrent units
with attention capture the temporal dependencies within sequences. The large NN
then acts as the teacher to guide the training of a lightweight student NN via
knowledge distillation. The student requires shorter input sequences yet
preserves long-term beam prediction ability. Numerical results demonstrate that
the teacher achieves Top-5 accuracies exceeding 93% for current and six future
time slots, approaching state-of-the-art performance with a 90% complexity
reduction. The student closely matches the teacher's performance while cutting
complexity by another 90%, despite operating with 60% shorter input sequences.
This improvement significantly enhances data efficiency, reduces latency, and
lowers power consumption in sensing and processing.

Abstract: Motivated by the constant modulus property of frequency shift keying (FSK)
based waveforms and the stabilisation of its radar performance with an increase
in the number of subpulses, in this paper an FSK-based dynamic subpulse number
joint communications and radar waveform design is proposed. From a
communications point of view, the system operates based on traditional FSK
modulation. From a sensing point of view, although the subpulses are
continuously generated and transmitted, radar waveforms are dynamically formed
by monitoring the flatness of the spectrum which in turn guarantees the
accuracy of the delay estimation. Other constraints on the waveform length are
used to ensure satisfactory values of the root mean square time duration,
ambiguity function sidelobe levels and prevent overly long waveforms. To
provide an estimation of the probability of generating extremely long
waveforms, the distribution of the number of subpulses is approximated using a
Brownian motion process and an existing result on its one-sided exit density.
Numerical examples are provided to evaluate the accuracy of the approximate
distribution, as well as the ambiguity function sidelobe levels and the delay
and Doppler shift estimation performance of the transmitted waveforms.

Conclusion: 该项目不仅开发了可行的系统，还为未来模拟电子领域的射频电路设计、分析和构建提供了宝贵的经验

Abstract: In this project, we wanted to discover an analog topology that could
effectively convert amplitude-modulated (AM) signals to frequency-modulated
(FM) signals, while also ensuring that both sets of signals were within their
respective radio frequency (RF) bands. To that end, an effective topology for
doing so was developed, characterized, and demonstrated, requiring the ability
to de-modulate incoming signals from the AM radio band--spanning from 530 kHz
to 1700 kHz--and re-modulate these signals into the FM radio band--spanning
from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. These bands are separated by roughly 86 MHz, presenting
the need for the topology to radically alter the incoming frequency before
re-broadcasting. At its simplest implementation, this required an AM
demodulation circuit coupled to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO).
Together, these two circuits translated variations in the incoming envelope
signal to variations in the output frequency while still maintaining
high-fidelity audio, similar to how existing radio receiving and broadcasting
are done. Altogether, the project not only developed a working system but also
provided valuable instruction in the design, analysis, and construction of
effective RF circuits--invaluable to future endeavors within analog
electronics.

Abstract: Cooperative reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are promising
technologies for 6G networks to support a great number of users. Compared with
the fixed RISs, the properly deployed RISs may improve the communication
performance with less communication energy consumption, thereby improving the
energy efficiency. In this paper, we consider a cooperative unmanned aerial
vehicle-mounted RISs (UAV-RISs)-assisted cellular network, where multiple RISs
are carried and enhanced by UAVs to serve multiple ground users (GUs)
simultaneously such that achieving the three-dimensional (3D) mobility and
opportunistic deployment. Specifically, we formulate an energy-efficient
communication problem based on multi-objective optimization framework
(EEComm-MOF) to jointly consider the beamforming vector of base station (BS),
the location deployment and the discrete phase shifts of UAV-RIS system so as
to simultaneously maximize the minimum available rate over all GUs, maximize
the total available rate of all GUs, and minimize the total energy consumption
of the system, while the transmit power constraint of BS is considered. To
comprehensively solve EEComm-MOF which is an NP-hard and non-convex problem
with constraints, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II with a
continuous solution processing mechanism, a discrete solution processing
mechanism, and a complex solution processing mechanism (INSGA-II-CDC) is
proposed. Simulations results demonstrate that the proposed INSGA-II-CDC can
solve EEComm-MOF effectively and outperforms other benchmarks under different

effectiveness of the improved mechanisms are verified. Finally, the
implementability analysis of the algorithm is given.

Abstract: A systematic approach for high-speed via transition design is proposed. The
effects of via barrel radius, anti-pad size, and the distance from adjacent
stitching (GND) vias on bandwidth are analyzed and characterized. Guidelines
for selecting parameter values are provided and validated by correlating 3D
full-wave FEM simulation results with actual measurements of the coupon board.
When a sufficient number of stitching vias are used, the via structure can be
approximated as a coaxial transmission line. The proposed methodology builds on
this approximation and also considers high-order modes. With this framework,
engineers can easily optimize design parameters while intuitively understanding
how geometry affects bandwidth. This approach also allows engineers with
limited access to expensive and computationally intensive 3D FEM tools to
design high bandwidth vias up to 67 GHz.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) and dual-polarized SIM (DPSIM) enabled
wave-domain signal processing have emerged as promising research directions for
offloading baseband digital processing tasks and efficiently simplifying

bitstream to the received bitstream, we propose an SIM (DPSIM)- assisted E2E
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where traditional
communication tasks such as modulation, precoding, combining, and demodulation
are performed simultaneously during electromagnetic (EM) forward propagation.
Furthermore, inspired by the idea of abstracting real metasurfaces as hidden

(EMNN) to enable the control of the E2E OFDM communication system. In addition,
transfer learning is introduced into the model training, and a training and
deployment framework for the EMNN is designed. Simulation results demonstrate
that both SIM-assisted E2E OFDM systems and DPSIM-assisted E2E OFDM systems can
achieve robust bitstream transmission under complex channel conditions. Our
study highlights the application potential of EMNN and SIM (DPSIM)-assisted E2E
OFDM systems in the design of next-generation transceivers.

Abstract: A radio map captures the spatial distribution of wireless channel parameters,
such as the strength of the signal received, across a geographic area. The
problem of fine-grained three-dimensional (3D) radio map estimation involves
inferring a high-resolution radio map for the two-dimensional (2D) area at an
arbitrary target height within a 3D region of interest, using radio samples
collected by sensors sparsely distributed in that 3D region. Solutions to the
problem are crucial for efficient spectrum management in 3D spaces,
particularly for drones in the rapidly developing low-altitude economy.
However, this problem is challenging due to ultra-sparse sampling, where the
number of collected radio samples is far fewer than the desired resolution of
the radio map to be estimated. In this paper, we design a Large Artificial
Intelligence Model (LAM) called RadioLAM for the problem. RadioLAM employs the
creative power and the strong generalization capability of LAM to address the
ultra-sparse sampling challenge. It consists of three key blocks: 1) an
augmentation block, using the radio propagation model to project the radio
samples collected at different heights to the 2D area at the target height; 2)
a generation block, leveraging an LAM under an Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture to generate a candidate set of fine-grained radio maps for the
target 2D area; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model
as a guide to find the best map from the candidate set. Extensive simulations
show that RadioLAM is able to solve the fine-grained 3D radio map estimation
problem efficiently from an ultra-low sampling rate of 0.1%, and significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The rapid development of the low-altitude economy has imposed unprecedented
demands on wireless infrastructure to accommodate large-scale drone deployments
and facilitate intelligent services in dynamic airspace environments. However,
unlocking its full potential in practical applications presents significant
challenges. Traditional aerial systems predominantly focus on air-ground
communication services, often neglecting the integration of sensing,
computation, control, and energy-delivering functions, which hinders the
ability to meet diverse mission-critical demands. Besides, the absence of
systematic low-altitude airspace planning and management exacerbates issues
regarding dynamic interference in three-dimensional space, coverage
instability, and scalability. To overcome these challenges, a comprehensive
framework, termed low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), has emerged to
seamlessly integrate communication, sensing, computation, control, and air
traffic management into a unified design. This article provides a comprehensive
overview of LAWN systems, introducing LAWN system fundamentals and the
evolution of functional designs. Subsequently, we delve into performance
evaluation metrics and review critical concerns surrounding privacy and
security in the open-air network environment. Finally, we present the
cutting-edge developments in airspace structuring and air traffic management,
providing insights to facilitate the practical deployment of LAWNs.

Abstract: Beam training and prediction in millimeter-wave communications are highly
challenging due to fast time-varying channels and sensitivity to blockages and
mobility. In this context, infrastructure-mounted cameras can capture rich
environmental information that can facilitate beam tracking design. In this
work, we develop an efficient attention-enhanced machine learning model for
long-term beam tracking built upon convolutional neural networks and gated
recurrent units to predict both current and future beams from past observed
images. The integrated temporal attention mechanism substantially improves its
predictive performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design
achieves Top-5 beam prediction accuracies exceeding 90% across both current and
six future time slots, significantly reducing overhead arising from sensing and
processing for beam training. It further attains 97% of state-of-the-art
performance with only 3% of the computational complexity.

Motivation: GPS导致的米级位置错误会影响光线追踪模拟的准确性，导致不可靠的渗透特性检验和验证，以及材料属性调整错误。

Method: 采用计算高效的多阶段网格搜索和Powell方法进行优化，对比测量和模拟的全向功率延迟派涉进行对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架能够提高光线追踪模拟的准确性，对下一代无线网络的材料属性调整和基站部署至关重要。

Abstract: Ray tracing (RT) simulations require accurate transmitter (TX) and receiver
(RX) location information from real-world measurements to accurately
characterize wireless propagation behavior in an environment. Such wireless
propagation measurements typically employ GPS-based logging for TX/RX
locations, which can produce meter-level errors that lead to unreliable RT
calibration and validation. These location misalignments cause inaccurate
interactions between RT-generated multipath components (MPCs) and the modeled
3D environment, which lead to erroneous channel predictions, and severe
discrepancies between simulated and measured power delay profiles (PDPs) and
channel characteristics. Moreover, the same RT-generated PDPs using inaccurate
locations result in calibration errors when adjusting material properties such
as conductivity and permittivity.
  This paper presents a systematic multi-stage TX/RX location calibration
framework to correct location errors and consequently align measured and
simulated omnidirectional PDPs.
  Optimization is performed using a computationally efficient multi-stage grid
search and the Powell method. Applying the location calibration framework to
NYU WIRELESS urban-microcell (UMi) measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz
corrected TX/RX location errors of up to 7 m. The framework reduced the
composite loss function by 42.3\% for line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5\% for
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Furthermore, peak power prediction accuracy
improved by approximately 1 dB on average. Such improved geometric alignment
enables accurate channel prediction, vital for beam management and
infrastructure deployment for next-generation wireless networks.

Conclusion: 该方法为静态和动态网络提供了一种健壁、分布式且成本效率高的节点选择解决方案，无需位置或距离估计

Abstract: The selection of nodes that can serve as cluster heads, local sinks and
gateways is a critical challenge in distributed sensor and communication
networks. This paper presents a novel framework for identifying a minimal set
of nexus nodes to ensure full network coverage while minimizing cost. By
formulating the problem as a convex relaxation of the NP-hard set cover
problem, we integrate the graph theoretic centrality measures of node degree
and betweenness centrality into a cost function optimized via a relaxed L1-norm
minimization. The proposed approach is applicable to static and dynamic network
scenarios and does not require location or distance estimation. Through
simulations across various graph models and dynamic conditions, it is shown
that the method achieves faster execution times (lower complexity) and
competitive sparsity compared to classical greedy and genetic algorithms (GA),
offering a robust, distributed, and cost-efficient node selection solution.

Conclusion: 多激活FAMA实现了有效的无CSI多用户通信，为高容量无线网络提供了可扩展的解决方案，经理论模型、3D电磁仿真和实验验证有效

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently emerged as a promising solution for
sixth-generation (6G) ultra-dense connectivity. These systems utilize dynamic
radiating and/or shaping techniques to mitigate interference and improve
spectral efficiency without relying on channel state information (CSI). The
reported improvements achieved by employing a single dynamically activated
radiating position in fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) are significant. To
fully realize the potential of FAMA in multi-user multiplexing, we propose
leveraging the unique fast-switching capabilities of a single radio-frequency
(RF)-chain meta-fluid antenna structure to achieve multi-activation. This
allows for a significantly larger set of independent radiating states without
requiring additional signal processing. Simulations demonstrate that
multi-activation FAMA enables robust multi-user multiplexing with a higher
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) under various Rayleigh-fading environments
compared to other single RF-chain technologies. We further show that the SIR
can be optimized within a 15~$\mu s$ timeframe under a multi-user
Rayleigh-fading channel, making the proposed scheme highly suitable for
fast-changing wireless environments. Verified through the theoretical Jakes'
model, full three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic (EM) simulations and
experimental validation, multi-activation FAMA enables effective CSI-free,
multi-user communication, offering a scalable solution for high-capacity
wireless networks.

Conclusion: RadarLLM通过偏好识别损失有效减少了过拟合问题，提升了预训练语言模型在海洋目标检测任务中的性能和推广性

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
their capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising
general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated
by these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs
for the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection
tasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target
detection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in
challenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting
primarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature
patterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to
unseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel
fine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike
conventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens,
this loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on
their online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the
most generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate
the effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem
as selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine
radar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the
original one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR
scenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
across diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under
limited training data conditions.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are widely used to extract high-dimensional
patterns from the sequence features of radar echo signals. However,
conventional DL algorithms face challenges such as redundant feature segments,
and constraints from restricted model sizes. To address these issues, we
propose a framework that integrates feature preprocessing with large language
models (LLMs). Our preprocessing module tokenizes radar sequence features,
applies a patch selection algorithm to filter out uninformative segments, and
projects the selected patches into embeddings compatible with the feature space
of pre-trained LLMs. Leveraging these refined embeddings, we incorporate a
pre-trained LLM, fine-tuning only the normalization layers to reduce training
burdens while enhancing performance. Experiments on measured datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines on supervised learning tests.

Abstract: Automatic differentiation through digital signal processing algorithms for
virtual analogue modelling has recently gained popularity. These algorithms are
typically more computationally efficient than black-box neural networks that
rely on dense matrix multiplications. Due to their differentiable nature, they
can be integrated with neural networks and jointly trained using gradient
descent algorithms, resulting in more efficient systems. Furthermore, signal
processing algorithms have significantly fewer parameters than neural networks,
allowing the application of the Newton-Raphson method. This method offers
faster and more robust convergence than gradient descent at the cost of
quadratic storage. This paper presents a method to emulate analogue levelling
amplifiers using a feed-forward digital compressor with parameters optimised
via the Newton-Raphson method. We demonstrate that a digital compressor can
successfully approximate the behaviour of our target unit, the Teletronix
LA-2A. Different strategies for computing the Hessian matrix are benchmarked.
We leverage parallel algorithms for recursive filters to achieve efficient
training on modern GPUs. The resulting model is made into a VST plugin and is

Abstract: State-of-the-art anomalous sound detection (ASD) systems in domain-shifted
conditions rely on projecting audio signals into an embedding space and using
distance-based outlier detection to compute anomaly scores. One of the major
difficulties to overcome is the so-called domain mismatch between the anomaly
score distributions of a source domain and a target domain that differ
acoustically and in terms of the amount of training data provided. A decision
threshold that is optimal for one domain may be highly sub-optimal for the
other domain and vice versa. This significantly degrades the performance when
only using a single decision threshold, as is required when generalizing to
multiple data domains that are possibly unseen during training while still
using the same trained ASD system as in the source domain. To reduce this
mismatch between the domains, we propose a simple local-density-based anomaly
score normalization scheme. In experiments conducted on several ASD datasets,
we show that the proposed normalization scheme consistently improves
performance for various types of embedding-based ASD systems and yields better
results than existing anomaly score normalization approaches.

Conclusion: LARoPE是一种简单但高效的方法，在标准零样本TTS测试中达到了最高水平的词误率，为长语音生成提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Many recent text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built on transformer
architectures and employ cross-attention mechanisms for text-speech alignment.
Within these systems, rotary position embedding (RoPE) is commonly used to
encode positional information in text and speech representations. In this work,
we introduce length-aware RoPE (LARoPE), a simple yet effective extension of
RoPE that improves text-speech alignment. Unlike RoPE, which relies on absolute
indices, LARoPE computes relative distances between query and key positions
using length-normalized indices. Experimental results show that LARoPE
consistently outperforms RoPE, offering faster loss convergence, more accurate
text-speech alignment, and higher overall TTS quality. Furthermore, LARoPE
demonstrates greater resilience to variations in utterance duration and
maintains stable performance in extended speech generation up to 30 seconds,
whereas RoPE suffers from notable degradation. Notably, our method achieves a
state-of-the-art word error rate on a standard zero-shot TTS benchmark.

Conclusion: EEND-SAA成功解决了开放场景中主说话人检测问题，无需注册语音即可准确识别主要说话人，为实时语音处理系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Voice activity detection (VAD) is essential in speech-based systems, but
traditional methods detect only speech presence without identifying speakers.
Target-speaker VAD (TS-VAD) extends this by detecting the speech of a known
speaker using a short enrollment utterance, but this assumption fails in
open-domain scenarios such as meetings or customer service calls, where the
main speaker is unknown. We propose EEND-SAA, an enrollment-less,
streaming-compatible framework for main-speaker VAD, which identifies the
primary speaker without prior knowledge. Unlike TS-VAD, our method determines
the main speaker as the one who talks more steadily and clearly, based on
speech continuity and volume. We build our model on EEND using two
self-attention attractors in a Transformer and apply causal masking for
real-time use. Experiments on multi-speaker LibriSpeech mixtures show that
EEND-SAA reduces main-speaker DER from 6.63% to 3.61% and improves F1 from
0.9667 to 0.9818 over the SA-EEND baseline, achieving state-of-the-art
performance under conditions involving speaker overlap and noise.

Abstract: In the last several years the use of neural networks as tools to automate
species classification from digital data has increased. This has been due in
part to the high classification accuracy of image classification through
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the case of audio data CNN based
recognizers are used to automate the classification of species in audio
recordings by using information from sound visualization (i.e., spectrograms).
It is common for these recognizers to use the spectrogram as their sole input.
However, researchers have other non-audio data, such as habitat preferences of
a species, phenology, and range information, available that could improve
species classification. In this paper we present how a single-species
recognizer neural network's accuracy can be improved by using non-audio data as
inputs in addition to spectrogram information. We also analyze if the
improvements are merely a result of having a neural network with a higher
number of parameters instead of combining the two inputs. We find that networks
that use the two different inputs have a higher classification accuracy than
networks of similar size that use only one of the inputs.

Conclusion: 通过利用情感特征可以有效提高音频深度伪造检测系统的性能和沿用性，情感线索为反深度伪造检测提供了补充信息。

Abstract: Audio deepfake is so sophisticated that the lack of effective detection
methods is fatal. While most detection systems primarily rely on low-level
acoustic features or pretrained speech representations, they frequently neglect
high-level emotional cues, which can offer complementary and potentially
anti-deepfake information to enhance generalization. In this work, we propose a
novel audio anti-deepfake system that utilizes emotional features (EmoAnti) by
exploiting a pretrained Wav2Vec2 (W2V2) model fine-tuned on emotion recognition
tasks, which derives emotion-guided representations, then designing a dedicated
feature extractor based on convolutional layers with residual connections to
effectively capture and refine emotional characteristics from the transformer
layers outputs. Experimental results show that our proposed architecture
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the ASVspoof2019LA and
ASVspoof2021LA benchmarks, and demonstrates strong generalization on the
ASVspoof2021DF dataset. Our proposed approach's code is available at Anonymous

Conclusion: STASE通过LLM和物理渲染引擎的分离设计，为生成式空间音频提供了新的解决方案，但评估生成式空间音频仍面临挑战。

Abstract: While many text-to-audio systems produce monophonic or fixed-stereo outputs,
generating audio with user-defined spatial properties remains a challenge.
Existing deep learning-based spatialization methods often rely on latent-space
manipulations, which can limit direct control over psychoacoustic parameters
critical to spatial perception. To address this, we introduce STASE, a system
that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as an agent to interpret spatial
cues from text. A key feature of STASE is the decoupling of semantic
interpretation from a separate, physics-based spatial rendering engine, which
facilitates interpretable and user-controllable spatial reasoning. The LLM
processes prompts through two main pathways: (i) Description Prompts, for
direct mapping of explicit spatial information (e.g., "place the lead guitar at
45{\deg} azimuth, 10 m distance"), and (ii) Abstract Prompts, where a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module retrieves relevant spatial
templates to inform the rendering. This paper details the STASE workflow,
discusses implementation considerations, and highlights current challenges in
evaluating generative spatial audio.

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Speech Models (LSMs) has made their
security risks increasingly prominent. Traditional speech adversarial attack
methods face challenges in balancing effectiveness and stealth. This paper
proposes Evolutionary Noise Jailbreak (ENJ), which utilizes a genetic algorithm
to transform environmental noise from a passive interference into an actively
optimizable attack carrier for jailbreaking LSMs. Through operations such as
population initialization, crossover fusion, and probabilistic mutation, this
method iteratively evolves a series of audio samples that fuse malicious
instructions with background noise. These samples sound like harmless noise to
humans but can induce the model to parse and execute harmful commands.
Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream speech models show that ENJ's
attack effectiveness is significantly superior to existing baseline methods.
This research reveals the dual role of noise in speech security and provides
new critical insights for model security defense in complex acoustic
environments.

Abstract: Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) faces challenges in generalizing across
recording devices, particularly when labeled data is limited. The DCASE 2024
Challenge Task 1 highlights this issue by requiring models to learn from small
labeled subsets recorded on a few devices. These models need to then generalize
to recordings from previously unseen devices under strict complexity
constraints. While techniques such as data augmentation and the use of
pre-trained models are well-established for improving model generalization,
optimizing the training strategy represents a complementary yet less-explored
path that introduces no additional architectural complexity or inference
overhead. Among various training strategies, curriculum learning offers a
promising paradigm by structuring the learning process from easier to harder
examples. In this work, we propose an entropy-guided curriculum learning
strategy to address the domain shift problem in data-efficient ASC.
Specifically, we quantify the uncertainty of device domain predictions for each
training sample by computing the Shannon entropy of the device posterior
probabilities estimated by an auxiliary domain classifier. Using entropy as a
proxy for domain invariance, the curriculum begins with high-entropy samples
and gradually incorporates low-entropy, domain-specific ones to facilitate the
learning of generalizable representations. Experimental results on multiple
DCASE 2024 ASC baselines demonstrate that our strategy effectively mitigates
domain shift, particularly under limited labeled data conditions. Our strategy
is architecture-agnostic and introduces no additional inference cost, making it
easily integrable into existing ASC baselines and offering a practical solution

Abstract: Agentic AI has been standardized in industry as a practical paradigm for
coordinating specialized models and tools to solve complex multimodal tasks. In
this work, we present WeaveMuse, a multi-agent system for music understanding,
symbolic composition, and audio synthesis. Each specialist agent interprets
user requests, derives machine-actionable requirements (modalities, formats,
constraints), and validates its own outputs, while a manager agent selects and
sequences tools, mediates user interaction, and maintains state across turns.
The system is extendable and deployable either locally, using quantization and
inference strategies to fit diverse hardware budgets, or via the HFApi to
preserve free community access to open models. Beyond out-of-the-box use, the
system emphasizes controllability and adaptation through constraint schemas,
structured decoding, policy-based inference, and parameter-efficient adapters
or distilled variants that tailor models to MIR tasks. A central design goal is
to facilitate intermodal interaction across text, symbolic notation and
visualization, and audio, enabling analysis-synthesis-render loops and
addressing cross-format constraints. The framework aims to democratize,
implement, and make accessible MIR tools by supporting interchangeable
open-source models of various sizes, flexible memory management, and
reproducible deployment paths.

*Satyajeet Prabhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 评估两种深度学习模型（TCN和Beat This!）在卡纳提克音乐节拍追踪任务中的表现，通过迁移学习策略显著提升性能，达到或超越传统DBN基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在西方音乐节拍追踪表现出色，但在卡纳提克音乐等代表性不足的音乐传统中性能不佳，需要探索SOTA模型在这些领域的适应性和有效性

Method: 使用Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)和transformer-based的Beat This!模型，在CMR_f数据集上复现DBN基线的实验设置，采用微调和音乐知识参数等适应策略

Result: 现成模型不总是优于DBN，但通过迁移学习后性能显著提升，能够匹配或超越基线水平

Conclusion: SOTA深度学习模型可以通过有效适应策略应用于代表性不足的音乐传统，为构建更具包容性和广泛适用性的节拍追踪系统铺平道路

Abstract: Beat and downbeat tracking, jointly referred to as Meter Tracking, is a
fundamental task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Deep learning models
have far surpassed traditional signal processing and classical machine learning
approaches in this domain, particularly for Western (Eurogenetic) genres, where
large annotated datasets are widely available. These systems, however, perform
less reliably on underrepresented musical traditions. Carnatic music, a rich
tradition from the Indian subcontinent, is renowned for its rhythmic intricacy
and unique metrical structures (t\=alas). The most notable prior work on meter
tracking in this context employed probabilistic Dynamic Bayesian Networks
(DBNs). The performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models on
Carnatic music, however, remains largely unexplored.
  In this study, we evaluate two models for meter tracking in Carnatic music:
the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), a lightweight architecture that has
been successfully adapted for Latin rhythms, and Beat This!, a
transformer-based model designed for broad stylistic coverage without the need
for post-processing. Replicating the experimental setup of the DBN baseline on
the Carnatic Music Rhythm (CMR$_f$) dataset, we systematically assess the
performance of these models in a directly comparable setting. We further
investigate adaptation strategies, including fine-tuning the models on Carnatic
data and the use of musically informed parameters. Results show that while
off-the-shelf models do not always outperform the DBN, their performance
improves substantially with transfer learning, matching or surpassing the
baseline. These findings indicate that SOTA deep learning models can be
effectively adapted to underrepresented traditions, paving the way for more
inclusive and broadly applicable meter tracking systems.

TL;DR: FuseCodec是一种新的语音标记化方法，通过融合声学、语义和上下文表示，实现了跨模态对齐和全局监督，在语音转录、感知质量等方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经编解码器主要捕获低层声学特征，忽略了语音中的语义和上下文信息，需要更好的表示对齐和统一方法。

Method: 提出三种互补技术：潜在表示融合、全局语义-上下文监督、时间对齐上下文监督，实现跨模态对齐和统一表示学习。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上超越了EnCodec、SpeechTokenizer和DAC，在转录准确性、感知质量、可懂度和说话人相似性方面表现最优。

Conclusion: FuseCodec证明了上下文和语义引导的标记化方法在语音标记化和下游任务中的有效性，并展示了在零样本语音合成中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech
language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic
features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human
speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from
self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from
pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the
semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies
acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal
alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary
techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and
contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and
unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision,
supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted
representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and
(iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by
dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for
fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS,
demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis.
Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech,
surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy,
perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight
the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for
speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are
available at https://github.com/mubtasimahasan/FuseCodec.

TL;DR: 本文提出无监督方法发现EDM的自然声学结构，发现当前EDM分类体系存在约1/3的过度指定问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EDM分类通常依赖行业定义的分类法，但子流派之间的声学基础不明确，现有监督学习方法假设标签有效性而缺乏系统评估

Method: 结合新颖的基于tempogram的特征（捕捉EDM分层节奏模式）和多标准特征选择的无监督方法，并与MERT和CLAP预训练音频嵌入进行对比验证

Result: 特征空间和嵌入表示都收敛到19-23个自然声学家族，而规定的有35个，表明当前EDM分类法存在约1/3的过度指定

Conclusion: 无监督方法揭示了EDM的自然声学结构，证明商业标签体系存在显著过度分类，为音乐分类提供了更客观的声学基础

Abstract: Electronic Dance Music (EDM) classification typically relies on
industry-defined taxonomies with numerous subgenres, yet the acoustic basis for
these distinctions remains unclear. Current approaches use supervised learning
with prescribed genre labels, assuming their validity without systematic
evaluation. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to discover the
natural acoustic structure of EDM independent of commercial labels. Our method
combines novel tempogram-based features capturing EDM's layered rhythmic
patterns with multi-criteria feature selection. To validate that our findings
reflect genuine acoustic structure rather than methodological artifacts, we
compare our results against state-of-the-art pre-trained audio embeddings (MERT
and CLAP). Both our feature space and embedding representations converge to
19-23 natural acoustic families compared to the prescribed 35, providing
consistent evidence of significant overspecification in current EDM taxonomy by
approximately one-third.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球首要死因，早期检测至关重要。虽然深度学习已应用于心音分析，但同步多通道数据的缺乏限制了先进模型的应用

Method: 结合传统信号处理和WaveGrad、DiffWave去噪激流模型进行数据增帽，然后微调Wav2Vec 2.0基础的变换器分类器

Result: 在CinC 2016单通道PCG数据集上达到92.48%准确率；在同步PCG-ECG数据上达到93.14%准确率；在可穿戴多通道PCG数据上达到77.13%准确率

Conclusion: 通过数据增帽支持的变换器模型在多模态多通道心音分析中具有高效性，为心血管疾病检测提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide,
accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is
critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods.
Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds
indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However,
state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited
availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and
pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling
transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines
traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and
DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based
classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC)
2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR),
sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach
92.48\%, 93.05\%, 93.63\%, 92.48\%, 94.93\% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the
synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14\%,
92.21\%, 94.35\%, 90.10\%, 95.12\% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR,
sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset
consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13\% accuracy, 74.25\% UAR,
86.47\% sensitivity, 62.04\% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection
when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance
multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.

*Adhiraj Banerjee,Vipul Arora*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: CodecSep是一个基于神经音频编解码器的高效文本引导音频分离模型，相比AudioSep计算量减少54倍，在分离保真度上表现更优，同时保持竞争性的感知质量和完全比特流兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本引导音频分离模型（如AudioSep）计算量过大，不适合边缘设备部署，而现有的神经音频编解码器模型虽然计算高效但仅限于固定类别的分离，需要一种既能实现通用文本驱动分离又适合边缘部署的解决方案。

Method: CodecSep结合DAC压缩技术和基于Transformer的掩码器，通过CLAP派生的FiLM参数进行调制，实现了高效的文本驱动音频分离。

Result: 在六个开放域基准测试中，CodecSep在分离保真度（SI-SDR）上超越了AudioSep，在感知质量（ViSQOL）上保持竞争力，同时匹配或超越了固定音轨基线模型。端到端仅需1.35 GMACs计算量，比AudioSep减少54倍。

Conclusion: CodecSep成功实现了首个基于神经音频编解码器的通用文本驱动分离模型，在保持高质量分离性能的同时大幅降低了计算需求，适合边缘设备部署，并保持完全比特流兼容性。

Abstract: Text-guided source separation supports flexible audio editing across media
and assistive applications, but existing models like AudioSep are too
compute-heavy for edge deployment. Neural audio codec (NAC) models such as
CodecFormer and SDCodec are compute-efficient but limited to fixed-class
separation. We introduce CodecSep, the first NAC-based model for on-device
universal, text-driven separation. CodecSep combines DAC compression with a
Transformer masker modulated by CLAP-derived FiLM parameters. Across six
open-domain benchmarks under matched training/prompt protocols,
\textbf{CodecSep} surpasses \textbf{AudioSep} in separation fidelity (SI-SDR)
while remaining competitive in perceptual quality (ViSQOL) and matching or
exceeding fixed-stem baselines (TDANet, CodecFormer, SDCodec). In code-stream
deployments, it needs just 1.35~GMACs end-to-end -- approximately $54\times$
less compute ($25\times$ architecture-only) than spectrogram-domain separators
like AudioSep -- while remaining fully bitstream-compatible.

TL;DR: 通过PoolingVQ技术缩短音频序列特征长度减少冗余，结合两阶段关注融合机制，在多模态音乐情感分析任务中实现了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流方法重点复杂的特征提取网络，而论文认为缩短音频序列特征长度减少冗余（相比MIDI紧凑表示）可有效提升任务性能。

Method: 组合向量量化变分自动编码器(VQVAE)和空间池化，发展PoolingVQ直接压缩音频特征序列通过局部聚合减少冗余，然后设计两阶段关注融合机制来融合音频和MIDI信息。

Result: 在公共数据集EMOPIA和VGMIDI上的实验结果显示，该多模态框架实现了最先进的整体性能，PoolingVQ带来了一定的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过缩短音频特征序列减少冗余的方法，结合高效的多模态融合机制，可以有效提升多模态音乐情感分析的性能表现。

Abstract: Multimodal music emotion analysis leverages audio and MIDI modalities to
enhance performance. While mainstream approaches focus on complex feature
extraction networks, we posit that shortening the length of audio sequence
features to mitigate redundancy, especially in contrast to MIDI's compact
representation, may effectively boost task performance. To achieve this, we
developed PoolingVQ by combining Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder
(VQVAE) with spatial pooling, which directly compresses audio feature sequences
through local aggregation to reduce redundancy, then devised a two-stage
co-attention approach to fuse audio and MIDI information. Experimental results
on the public datasets EMOPIA and VGMIDI demonstrate that our multimodal
framework achieves state-of-the-art overall performance, with PoolingVQ
yielding some improvement.

TL;DR: 基于冻结预训练SSL编码器的音频深度伪造检测系统在域外条件下的泛化性问题研究，通过层级分析、池化策略优化和融合多个编码器来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冻结预训练SSL编码器系统在域外(OOD)条件下泛化性不足的问题，提高音频深度伪造检测系统的可靠性和适应性。

Method: 对6种不同预训练SSL模型进行层级分析，确定关键层；比较单层选择与MHFA自动选择策略；使用四个测试语料库评估；应用分数级融合技术。

Result: 选择最佳层可在减少80%系统参数的同时获得良好结果；不同测试语料库和SSL模型表现差异显著；多个编码器融合显著提升了OOD攻击的泛化性。

Conclusion: 通过精心选择SSL编码器的关键层可以在保持高性能的同时大幅减少模型复杂度，而多模态融合是提高域外泛化性的有效策略。

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection systems based on frozen pre-trained self-supervised
learning (SSL) encoders show a high level of performance when combined with
layer-weighted pooling methods, such as multi-head factorized attentive pooling
(MHFA). However, they still struggle to generalize to out-of-domain (OOD)
conditions. We tackle this problem by studying the behavior of six different
pre-trained SSLs, on four different test corpora. We perform a layer-by-layer
analysis to determine which layers contribute most. Next, we study the pooling
head, comparing a strategy based on a single layer with automatic selection via
MHFA. We observed that selecting the best layer gave very good results, while
reducing system parameters by up to 80%. A wide variation in performance as a
function of test corpus and SSL model is also observed, showing that the
pre-training strategy of the encoder plays a role. Finally, score-level fusion
of several encoders improved generalization to OOD attacks.

However, this approach is\nnot parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic,\nin-the-wild data types. To address these limitations, we introduce a new family\nof parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal\nprocessing transforms. These include FourierPT-XLSR, which uses the Fourier\nTransform, and two variants based on the Wavelet Transform: WSPT-XLSR and\nPartial-WSPT-XLSR. We further propose WaveSP-Net, a novel architecture\ncombining a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end and a bidirectional Mamba-based\nback-end. This design injects multi-resolution features into the prompt\nembeddings, which enhances the localization of subtle synthetic artifacts\nwithout altering the frozen XLSR parameters.

To train SER systems, researchers collect emotional speech\ndatabases annotated by crowdsourced or in-house raters who select emotions from\npredefined categories. However, disagreements among raters are common.\nConventional methods treat these disagreements as noise, aggregating labels\ninto a single consensus target. While this simplifies SER as a single-label\ntask, it ignores the inherent subjectivity of human emotion perception. This\ndissertation challenges such assumptions and asks: (1) Should minority\nemotional ratings be discarded? (2) Should SER systems learn from only a few\nindividuals' perceptions? (3) Should SER systems predict only one emotion per\nsample?\n  Psychological studies show that emotion perception is subjective and\nambiguous, with overlapping emotional boundaries. We propose new modeling and\nevaluation perspectives: (1) Retain all emotional ratings and represent them\nwith soft-label distributions. Models trained on individual annotator ratings\nand jointly optimized with standard SER systems improve performance on\nconsensus-labeled tests. (2) Redefine SER evaluation by including all emotional\ndata and allowing co-occurring emotions (e.g., sad and angry). We propose an\n``all-inclusive rule'' that aggregates all ratings to maximize diversity in\nlabel representation. Experiments on four English emotion databases show\nsuperior performance over majority and plurality labeling. (3) Construct a\npenalization matrix to discourage unlikely emotion combinations during\ntraining. Integrating it into loss functions further improves performance.\nOverall, embracing minority ratings, multiple annotators, and multi-emotion\npredictions yields more robust and human-aligned SER systems."}

The topic is especially\nrelevant for instruments such as the rhythm guitar, which is typically played\nby strumming rhythmic patterns that repeat and vary over time. However, in many\ncases one cannot objectively define a single \"right\" rhythmic pattern for a\ngiven song section. To create a dataset with well-defined ground-truth labels,\nwe asked expert musicians to transcribe the rhythmic patterns in 410 popular\nsongs and record cover versions where the guitar tracks followed those\ntranscriptions. To transcribe the strums and their corresponding rhythmic\npatterns, we propose a three-step framework. Firstly, we perform approximate\nstem separation to extract the guitar part from the polyphonic mixture.\nSecondly, we detect individual strums within the separated guitar audio, using\na pre-trained foundation model (MERT) as a backbone. Finally, we carry out a\npattern-decoding process in which the transcribed sequence of guitar strums is\nrepresented by patterns drawn from an expert-curated vocabulary. We show that\nit is possible to transcribe the rhythmic patterns of the guitar track in\npolyphonic music with quite high accuracy, producing a representation that is\nhuman-readable and includes automatically detected bar lines and time signature\nmarkers.

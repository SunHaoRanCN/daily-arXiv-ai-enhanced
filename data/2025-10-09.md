### [1] [Distributed Detection and Bandwidth Allocation with Hybrid Quantized and Full-Precision Observations over Multiplicative Fading Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06429)
*Linlin Mao,Zeping Sui,Michail Matthaiou,Hongbin Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合量化和全精度观测的混合检测器，用于加性和乘性高斯噪声下的弱信号检测，包括LMPT检测器设计、量化阈值优化和带宽分配策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在带宽受限和易出错信道条件下，需要有效检测弱信号，传统方法在资源受限环境中性能有限。

Method: 基于复合观测分布推导LMPT混合检测器，优化传感器级量化阈值，提出混合整数线性规划方法解决带宽分配问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明所提混合检测器和带宽分配策略在易出错信道条件下具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合检测框架在资源受限环境中有效提升了弱信号检测性能。

Abstract: A hybrid detector that fuses both quantized and full-precision observations
is proposed for weak signal detection under additive and multiplicative
Gaussian noise. We first derive a locally most powerful test (LMPT)--based
hybrid detector from the composite probability distribution of the compound
observations received by the fusion center, and then analyze its asymptotic
detection performance. Subsequently, we optimize the sensor-wise quantization
thresholds to achieve near-optimal asymptotic performance at the local sensor
level. Moreover, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming approach to
solve the optimization problem of transmission bandwidth allocation accounting
for bandwidth constraints and error-prone channels. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed hybrid detector and the bandwidth
allocation strategy, especially in challenging error-prone channel conditions.

Abstract: Load forecasting has always been a challenge for grid operators due to the
growing complexity of power systems. The increase in extreme weather and the
need for energy from customers has led to load forecasting sometimes failing.
This research presents a Support Vector Regression (SVR) framework for electric
load forecasting that outperforms the industry standard. The SVR model
demonstrates better accuracy across all evaluation metrics that are important
for power system operations. The model has a 54.2\% reduction in Mean Squared
Error (31.91 vs. 69.63), a 33.5\% improvement in Mean Absolute Error, and
performance benefits across other metrics. These improvements show significant
benefits when integrated with power forecasting tools and show that the
approach provides an additional tool for accuracy checking for system planning
and resource allocation in times of need for resource allocation in electric
power systems.

*Yan Yang,Zhendong Li,Jianwei Zhao,Qingqing Wu,Zhiqing Wei,Wen Chen,Weimin Jia*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一个联合主动和被动感知的统一设计框架，用于多静态协作ISAC系统，通过交替优化算法最大化DL和UL传输的和速率，同时保证感知要求和功率约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多静态协作感知是推进ISAC的有前景技术，能提高感知精度和范围。需要解决DL和UL通信共存场景下的联合优化问题。

Result: 大量数值结果验证了所提JAPS方案的性能提升，证明了所提算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的JAPS框架和算法能有效解决多静态ISAC系统中的联合优化问题，提升系统性能。

Abstract: Multi-static cooperative sensing emerges as a promising technology for
advancing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), enhancing sensing
accuracy and range. In this paper, we develop a unified design framework for
joint active and passive sensing (JAPS). In particular, we consider a JAPSbased
cooperative multi-static ISAC system for coexisting downlink (DL) and uplink
(UL) communications. An optimization problem is formulated for maximizing the
sum rate of both the DL and UL transmissions via jointly optimizing
beamforming, receive filters and power allocation, while guaranteeing the
sensing requirements and transmission power constraints. However, the
formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem that is challenging to
solve directly due to the tight coupling among optimization variables. To
tackle this complicated issue, we employ an efficient algorithm architecture
leveraging alternating optimization (AO). Specifically, with the given receive
filters and transmission power for UL communication, the transmit beamforming
subproblem is addressed by successive convex approximation (SCA)-based and
penalty-based algorithms. A fractional programming (FP)-based algorithm is
developed to tackle the receive filters and transmission power for UL
communication optimization subproblem. Extensive numerical results validate the
performance improvement of our proposed JAPS scheme and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于期望最大化算法的个性化联邦学习框架，用于集成感知与通信系统中的多目标优化，通过自适应确定基站聚合权重来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准联邦学习方法对所有客户端统一处理，无法在通信和感知目标竞争的场景中适应应用特定的权衡需求

Method: 使用EM算法计算每个基站的后验概率，量化全局模型与局部模型的相对适用性，基于模型在各自数据集上的损失来确定聚合权重

Result: 在目标同质和异质条件下进行仿真研究，结果显示该方法优于FedPer和pFedMe等现有PFL基线，实现更快收敛和更好的多目标性能

Conclusion: 提出的EM-PFL框架在ISAC系统中能有效处理多目标优化问题，使基站能够动态适应应用特定的权衡，提升系统性能

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Expectation-Maximization-based (EM) Personalized
Federated Learning (PFL) framework for multi-objective optimization (MOO) in
Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. In contrast to standard
federated learning (FL) methods that handle all clients uniformly, the proposed
approach enables each base station (BS) to adaptively determine its aggregation
weight with the EM algorithm. Specifically, an EM posterior is computed at each
BS to quantify the relative suitability between the global and each local
model, based on the losses of models on their respective datasets. The proposed
method is especially valuable in scenarios with competing communication and
sensing objectives, as it enables BSs to dynamically adapt to
application-specific trade-offs. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed
approach, we conduct simulation studies under both objective-wise homogeneous
and heterogeneous conditions. The results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing PFL baselines, such as FedPer and pFedMe, achieving faster
convergence and better multi-objective performance.

Abstract: Low complexity error correction code is a key enabler for next generation
ultra-reliable low-latency communications (xURLLC) in six generation (6G).
Against this background, this paper proposes a decoding scheme for linear block
code by leveraging certain interesting properties of dual codewords. It is
found that dual codewords with flexible weights can provide useful decoding
information for the locations and magnitudes of error bits, which yielding
higher reliability performance. In addition, two decoding schemes are proposed,
in which one directly utilizes intrinsic information for iterative decoding,
and the other combines prior channel information with intrinsic information for
decoding. Both schemes are implemented using vector multiplication and
real-number comparisons, making them easy to implement in hardware. Simulation
results demonstrate the validness of our study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代无线网络中精确的用户定位和跟踪对于能效和超可靠低延迟应用至关重要。传统卡尔曼滤波定位技术存在计算复杂度和数据关联问题，且估计误差随用户轨迹速度增加而增长。

Method: 利用毫米波信号进行联合感知和通信，无需额外传感器。提出混合移动感知自适应框架，根据速度自适应选择扩展卡尔曼滤波器（行人速度）或无迹卡尔曼滤波器（车辆速度），通过自适应噪声缩放、卡方门控和Rauch-Tung-Striebel平滑来缓解数据关联问题和估计误差。

Abstract: Precise user localization and tracking enhances energy-efficient and
ultra-reliable low latency applications in the next generation wireless
networks. In addition to computational complexity and data association
challenges with Kalman-filter localization techniques, estimation errors tend
to grow as the user's trajectory speed increases. By exploiting mmWave signals
for joint sensing and communication, our approach dispenses with additional
sensors adopted in most techniques while retaining high resolution spatial
cues. We present a hybrid mobility-aware adaptive framework that selects the
Extended Kalman filter at pedestrian speed and the Unscented Kalman filter at
vehicular speed. The scheme mitigates data-association problem and estimation
errors through adaptive noise scaling, chi-square gating, Rauch-Tung-Striebel
smoothing. Evaluations using Absolute Trajectory Error, Relative Pose Error,
Normalized Estimated Error Squared and Root Mean Square Error metrics
demonstrate roughly 30-60% improvement in their respective regimes indicating a
clear advantage over existing approaches tailored to either indoor or static
settings.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time prediction of wireless channel conditions,
particularly the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), is a
foundational requirement for enabling Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication
(URLLC) in highly dynamic Industry 4.0 environments. Traditional physics-based
or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities
introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart
warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless
Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep
learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital
twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory
Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal
forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized
end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment
between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental
evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse
dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error.
Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen
environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously
moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency
essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational
technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous
optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in
industrial communication networks.

*Eren Berk Kama,Murat Babek Salman,Isaac Skog,Emil Björnson*

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通信系统的信道估计过程在数据传输期间会产生显著开销，消耗了本可用于数据的资源。

Method: 采用基于状态的方法，利用感知能力在没有通信请求时跟踪用户；当收到通信请求时，基于跟踪的用户位置进行预测波束成形；结合扩展卡尔曼滤波跟踪算法和自适应感知管理。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的感知管理方法通过实现无开销的预测波束成形，提供了比现有方法更高的均匀下行链路通信速率。

Conclusion: 该框架成功减少了信道估计开销，同时保持了高跟踪精度，为ISAC系统提供了更高效的资源利用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a sensing management method for integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems. Conventional communication systems employ channel estimation
procedures that impose significant overhead during data transmission, consuming
resources that could otherwise be utilized for data. To address this challenge,
we propose a state-based approach that leverages sensing capabilities to track
the user when there is no communication request. Upon receiving a communication
request, predictive beamforming is employed based on the tracked user position,
thereby reducing the need for channel estimation. Our framework incorporates an
extended Kalman filter (EKF) based tracking algorithm with adaptive sensing
management to perform sensing operations only when necessary to maintain high
tracking accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sensing
management approach provides uniform downlink communication rates that are
higher than with existing methods by achieving overhead-free predictive
beamforming.

### [10] [Maritime Communication in Evaporation Duct Environment with Ship Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06946)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在海上无线网络中，蒸发管道效应被认为是远距离传输的有利条件，但如何有效利用这种效应进行高效通信设计仍有待研究。

Conclusion: 利用蒸发管道效应的信道增益地图先验信息可以有效优化海上通信性能，减少传输时间和航行时间。

Abstract: In maritime wireless networks, the evaporation duct effect has been known as
a preferable condition for long-range transmissions. However, how to
effectively utilize the duct effect for efficient communication design is still
open for investigation. In this paper, we consider a typical scenario of
ship-to-shore data transmission, where a ship collects data from multiple
oceanographic buoys, sails from one to another, and transmits the collected
data back to a terrestrial base station during its voyage. A novel framework,
which exploits priori information of the channel gain map in the presence of
evaporation duct, is proposed to minimize the data transmission time and the
sailing time by optimizing the ship's trajectory. To this end, a
multi-objective optimization problem is formulated and is further solved by a
dynamic population PSO-integrated NSGA-II algorithm. Through simulations, it is
demonstrated that, compared to the benchmark scheme which ignores useful
information of the evaporation duct, the proposed scheme can effectively reduce
both the data transmission time and the sailing time.

Conclusion: 所提出的建模框架能够准确表征SAGIN在复杂信道条件下的性能，为紧急无线通信场景提供了可靠的理论分析工具。

Abstract: In emergency wireless communications (EWC) scenarios, ensuring reliable,
flexible, and high-rate transmission while simultaneously maintaining seamless
coverage and rapid response capabilities presents a critical technical
challenge. To this end, satellite-aerial-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has
emerged as a promising solution due to its comprehensive three-dimensional
coverage and capability to meet stringent, multi-faceted quality-of-service
(QoS) requirements. Nevertheless, most existing studies either neglected the
inherent characteristics of the complex channel conditions due to the terrain
changes or analyzed the performance in the absence of QoS constraints,
resulting in a mismatch between theoretical analysis and practical performance.
To remedy such deficiencies, in this paper we establish a performance modeling
framework for SAGIN employing the Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ composite
fading model to characterize the air-ground link. In specific, the proposed
$\mathcal{F}$ composite fading channel is adopted to accurately describe both
multipath fading and shadowing in harsh ground environments. The exact
distribution of end-to-end signal-to-noise (SNR) statistics for space-air and
air-ground links is developed, enabling theoretical analysis of cascaded
channels with fixed-gain amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)
relaying protocols, respectively. Furthermore, asymptotic expressions of the
derived results are provided to offer concise representations and demonstrate
close alignment with theoretical predictions in the high-SNR regime. Finally,
the insightful closed-form and asymptotic expressions of effective capacity
with QoS provisioning, outage probability, and $\epsilon$-outage capacity are
investigated, respectively, followed by both field measurements and Monte Carlo
simulations to verify the effectiveness.

### [12] [Moments Matter: Posterior Recovery in Poisson Denoising via Log-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07199)
*Shirin Shoushtari,Edward P. Chandler,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于对数网络的新策略用于泊松去噪，通过预测对数期望而非后验均值来恢复后验分布的高阶矩，从而支持后验近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泊松去噪在光子受限成像中很重要，但传统MSE损失只能得到后验均值，无法捕捉后验不确定性。高斯噪声中Tweedie公式可近似后验分布，但泊松噪声中不适用。

Method: 训练对数网络学习E[log x | y]，利用对数作为泊松分布的便捷参数化，理论上证明能恢复后验高阶矩。

Result: 在模拟数据上的实验表明，该方法与标准MMSE模型的去噪性能相当，同时提供了对后验分布的访问。

Conclusion: 提出的对数网络方法在保持去噪性能的同时，能够恢复后验不确定性，为泊松去噪提供了更完整的统计信息。

Abstract: Poisson denoising plays a central role in photon-limited imaging applications
such as microscopy, astronomy, and medical imaging. It is common to train deep
learning models for denoising using the mean-squared error (MSE) loss, which
corresponds to computing the posterior mean $\mathbb{E}[x \mid y]$. When the
noise is Gaussian, Tweedie's formula enables approximation of the posterior
distribution through its higher-order moments. However, this connection no
longer holds for Poisson denoising: while $ \mathbb{E}[x \mid y] $ still
minimizes MSE, it fails to capture posterior uncertainty. We propose a new
strategy for Poisson denoising based on training a log-network. Instead of
predicting the posterior mean $ \mathbb{E}[x \mid y] $, the log-network is
trained to learn $\mathbb{E}[\log x \mid y]$, leveraging the logarithm as a
convenient parameterization for the Poisson distribution. We provide a
theoretical proof that the proposed log-network enables recovery of
higher-order posterior moments and thus supports posterior approximation.
Experiments on simulated data show that our method matches the denoising
performance of standard MMSE models while providing access to the posterior.

Conclusion: 通过精心设计，轻量级模型可以达到与参数多13倍的大型模型相当的性能，为资源受限设备提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, significant advances have been made in music source
separation, with model architectures such as dual-path modeling, band-split
modules, or transformer layers achieving comparably good results. However,
these models often contain a significant number of parameters, posing
challenges to devices with limited computational resources in terms of training
and practical application. While some lightweight models have been introduced,
they generally perform worse compared to their larger counterparts. In this
paper, we take inspiration from these recent advances to improve a lightweight
model. We demonstrate that with careful design, a lightweight model can achieve
comparable SDRs to models with up to 13 times more parameters. Our proposed
model, Moises-Light, achieves competitive results in separating four musical
stems on the MUSDB-HQ benchmark dataset. The proposed model also demonstrates
competitive scalability when using MoisesDB as additional training data.

TL;DR: 本文提出负责任评估概念，认为当前TTS评估方法不足以全面评估技术能力、局限性和社会影响，需要建立三层渐进式评估框架来推动TTS技术的可信发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS技术已能产生难以区分的语音，但在评估实践中存在不足，无法全面捕捉技术能力、局限性和社会影响，需要建立更负责任的评估框架。

Method: 提出三层渐进式负责任评估框架：(1)确保模型能力的忠实准确反映，采用更稳健、区分性和全面的客观主观评分方法；(2)通过标准化基准、透明报告和可转移评估指标实现可比性、标准化和可转移性；(3)评估和减轻与伪造、滥用、隐私侵犯和安全漏洞相关的伦理风险。

Conclusion: 负责任评估概念将指导TTS技术朝着伦理健全和社会有益的应用方向发展，促进更可信可靠的TTS技术发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) technology have enabled systems to
produce human-indistinguishable speech, bringing benefits across accessibility,
content creation, and human-computer interaction. However, current evaluation
practices are increasingly inadequate for capturing the full range of
capabilities, limitations, and societal implications. This position paper
introduces the concept of Responsible Evaluation and argues that it is
essential and urgent for the next phase of TTS development, structured through
three progressive levels: (1) ensuring the faithful and accurate reflection of
a model's true capabilities, with more robust, discriminative, and
comprehensive objective and subjective scoring methodologies; (2) enabling
comparability, standardization, and transferability through standardized
benchmarks, transparent reporting, and transferable evaluation metrics; and (3)
assessing and mitigating ethical risks associated with forgery, misuse, privacy
violations, and security vulnerabilities. Through this concept, we critically
examine current evaluation practices, identify systemic shortcomings, and
propose actionable recommendations. We hope this concept of Responsible
Evaluation will foster more trustworthy and reliable TTS technology and guide
its development toward ethically sound and societally beneficial applications.

Conclusion: Whisper识别困难病例中声学线索的能力与人类专家的多模态和情境优势形成互补，表明机器学习系统在帕金森病语音检测中具有重要价值。

Abstract: The speech of people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) has been shown to hold
important clues about the presence and progression of the disease. We
investigate the factors based on which humans experts make judgments of the
presence of disease in speech samples over five different speech tasks:
phonations, sentence repetition, reading, recall, and picture description. We
make comparisons by conducting listening tests to determine clinicians accuracy
at recognizing signs of PD from audio alone, and we conduct experiments with a
machine learning system for detection based on Whisper. Across tasks, Whisper
performs on par or better than human experts when only audio is available,
especially on challenging but important subgroups of the data: younger
patients, mild cases, and female patients. Whisper's ability to recognize
acoustic cues in difficult cases complements the multimodal and contextual
strengths of human experts.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了BACHI模型，通过边界检测和迭代排序机制解决符号音乐自动和弦识别问题，并在增强数据集POP909-CL上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决符号音乐自动和弦识别中数据稀缺和缺乏人类音乐分析策略的问题。

Method: 提出BACHI模型，将和弦识别分解为边界检测和迭代排序（根音、和弦性质、低音）步骤，模拟人类听觉训练实践。

Result: 在古典和流行音乐基准测试中达到最先进的和弦识别性能，消融研究验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: BACHI模型通过模拟人类音乐分析策略，有效解决了符号音乐和弦识别问题，并在增强数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Automatic chord recognition (ACR) via deep learning models has gradually
achieved promising recognition accuracy, yet two key challenges remain. First,
prior work has primarily focused on audio-domain ACR, while symbolic music
(e.g., score) ACR has received limited attention due to data scarcity. Second,
existing methods still overlook strategies that are aligned with human music
analytical practices. To address these challenges, we make two contributions:
(1) we introduce POP909-CL, an enhanced version of POP909 dataset with
tempo-aligned content and human-corrected labels of chords, beats, keys, and
time signatures; and (2) We propose BACHI, a symbolic chord recognition model
that decomposes the task into different decision steps, namely boundary
detection and iterative ranking of chord root, quality, and bass (inversion).
This mechanism mirrors the human ear-training practices. Experiments
demonstrate that BACHI achieves state-of-the-art chord recognition performance
on both classical and pop music benchmarks, with ablation studies validating
the effectiveness of each module.

*Xutao Mao,Ke Li,Cameron Baird,Ezra Xuanru Tao,Dan Lin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 首次大规模跨领域评估假声检测器，测试8个最先进模型对抗20种假声生成系统的能力，揭示现有检测系统存在重大安全漏洞，并提出统一评估指标和改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成语音生成技术快速发展，各种假声生成器产生的音频已难以与真人语音区分，这对依赖录音作为关键证据的领域构成严重威胁。假声检测器虽然也在进步，但生成与检测之间的军备竞赛日益激烈复杂。

Method: 对8个最先进的假声检测模型进行大规模跨领域评估，使用20种不同假声生成系统合成的数据集进行基准测试，并提出统一的评估指标来标准化不同研究中的不一致评估标准。

Result: 研究发现当前假声检测系统存在显著的安全漏洞，在真实世界中的鲁棒性存在关键差距。这是迄今为止最全面的跨领域评估。

Conclusion: 提出了构建更具弹性的假声检测技术的可行建议，旨在加强AI安全和可信度的基础。统一的评估指标能够实现假声检测器鲁棒性的标准化、直接比较。

Abstract: As advances in synthetic voice generation accelerate, an increasing variety
of fake voice generators have emerged, producing audio that is often
indistinguishable from real human speech. This evolution poses new and serious
threats across sectors where audio recordings serve as critical evidence.
Although fake voice detectors are also advancing, the arms race between fake
voice generation and detection has become more intense and complex. In this
work, we present the first large-scale, cross-domain evaluation of fake voice
detectors, benchmarking 8 state-of-the-art models against datasets synthesized
by 20 different fake voice generation systems. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the most comprehensive cross-domain assessment conducted to date. Our
study reveals substantial security vulnerabilities in current fake voice
detection systems, underscoring critical gaps in their real-world robustness.
To advance the field, we propose a unified and effective metric that
consolidates the diverse and often inconsistent evaluation criteria previously
used across different studies. This metric enables standardized,
straightforward comparisons of the robustness of fake voice detectors. We
conclude by offering actionable recommendations for building more resilient
fake voice detection technologies, with the broader goal of reinforcing the
foundations of AI security and trustworthiness.

### [18] [Pitch Estimation With Mean Averaging Smoothed Product Spectrum And Musical Consonance Evaluation Using MASP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06625)
*Murat Yasar Baskin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了MASP频谱方法，改进谐波乘积谱以增强音高估计，并扩展到评估音乐协和度，发现音高和协和度感知可能共享基于频谱的相似机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对谐波乘积谱对缺失谐波过于敏感的问题，改进音高估计算法；基于协和度与周期性之间的强相关性，扩展算法评估音乐协和度。

Method: 引入基于全局均值的频谱平滑方法，提出MASP频谱算法；扩展该算法并提出谐和度度量H，用于评估双音和三音的协和度。

Result: MASP算法实现了与感知期望一致的鲁棒音高估计；协和度层次结构与音乐理论和感知实践相符。

Conclusion: 音高和协和度感知可能依赖于频谱的相似底层机制。

Abstract: This study introduces Mean Averaging Smoothed Product (MASP) Spectrum, which
is a modified version of the Harmonic Product Spectrum, designed to enhance
pitch estimation for many algorithm-wise deceptive frequency spectra that still
lead clear pitches, for both harmonic and inharmonic cases. By introducing a
global mean based smoothing for spectrum, the MASP algorithm diminishes the
unwanted sensitivity of HPS for spectra with missing partials. The method
exhibited robust pitch estimations consistent with perceptual expectations.
Motivated upon the strong correlation between consonance and periodicity, the
same algorithm is extended and, with the proposition of a harmonicity measure
(H), used to evaluate musical consonance for two and three tones; yielding
consonance hierarchies that align with perception and practice of music theory.
These findings suggest that perception of pitch and consonance may share a
similar underlying mechanism that depend on spectrum.

*Phuong Tuan Dat,Tran Huy Dat*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出用Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) 替换XLSR-Conformer模型中的传统MLP，在语音合成检测任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于自监督学习的XLSR-Conformer在合成语音检测中表现出色，但仍有架构改进空间，以应对日益复杂的语音欺骗攻击。

Method: 将XLSR-Conformer模型中的多层感知机(MLP)替换为基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)。

Result: 在ASVspoof2021数据集上，相对Equal Error Rate (EER)在LA和DF集上提升了60.55%，在21LA集上达到0.70% EER，且对多种SSL架构都具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 将KAN整合到基于SSL的模型中，是推进合成语音检测技术发展的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech synthesis technologies have led to increasingly
sophisticated spoofing attacks, posing significant challenges for automatic
speaker verification systems. While systems based on self-supervised learning
(SSL) models, particularly the XLSR-Conformer architecture, have demonstrated
remarkable performance in synthetic speech detection, there remains room for
architectural improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
replaces the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in the XLSR-Conformer
model with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a powerful universal approximator
based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Our experimental results
on ASVspoof2021 demonstrate that the integration of KAN to XLSR-Conformer model
can improve the performance by 60.55% relatively in Equal Error Rate (EER) LA
and DF sets, further achieving 0.70% EER on the 21LA set. Besides, the proposed
replacement is also robust to various SSL architectures. These findings suggest
that incorporating KAN into SSL-based models is a promising direction for
advances in synthetic speech detection.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了AudioMarathon基准测试，用于评估大型音频语言模型在长音频处理中的理解和推理效率，填补了现有基准测试在长上下文评估上的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频基准测试主要基于短音频片段，无法评估模型在真实长上下文环境中的表现，且当前大型音频语言模型在处理长音频时面临注意力机制二次成本和长程时间依赖建模的挑战。

Method: 构建包含三个支柱的多样化任务集：长上下文音频输入（90-300秒，对应2250-7500个音频token）、全领域覆盖（语音、声音、音乐）和需要多跳推理的复杂推理任务。

Result: 评估了最先进的LALMs，发现随着音频长度增加，性能明显下降；研究了加速技术并分析了token修剪和KV缓存淘汰的权衡；结果显示当前LALMs存在较大差距。

Conclusion: AudioMarathon将推动音频和多模态研究社区开发更先进的音频理解模型，需要更好的时间推理和内存高效架构来解决复杂音频任务。

Abstract: Processing long-form audio is a major challenge for Large Audio Language
models (LALMs). These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention
($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies. Existing audio
benchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models in
realistic long context settings. To address this gap, we introduce
AudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and
inference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set
of tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations
ranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of
2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech,
sound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We
evaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio
length grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs
of token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across
current LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and
memory-efficient architectures. We believe AudioMarathon will drive the audio
and multimodal research community to develop more advanced audio understanding
models capable of solving complex audio tasks.

Existing approaches typically compare audio recordings to\nmusic scores using heuristics or learnable models. This paper introduces\n\\textit{LadderSym}, a novel Transformer-based method for music error detection.\n\\textit{LadderSym} is guided by two key observations about the state-of-the-art\napproaches: (1) late fusion limits inter-stream alignment and cross-modality\ncomparison capability; and (2) reliance on score audio introduces ambiguity in\nthe frequency spectrum, degrading performance in music with concurrent notes.\nTo address these limitations, \\textit{LadderSym} introduces (1) a two-stream\nencoder with inter-stream alignment modules to improve audio comparison\ncapabilities and error detection F1 scores, and (2) a multimodal strategy that\nleverages both audio and symbolic scores by incorporating symbolic\nrepresentations as decoder prompts, reducing ambiguity and improving F1 scores.\nWe evaluate our method on the \\textit{MAESTRO-E} and \\textit{CocoChorales-E}\ndatasets by measuring the F1 score for each note category.

A system where\nmultiple targets transmit uplink pilots to a single-waveguide PASS under a\ntime-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is analyzed.

For the multi-target scenario, two target scheduling protocols\nare proposed: 1) pinch switching (PS), which performs separate pinching\nbeamforming for each time slot, and 2) pinch multiplexing (PM), which applies a\nsingle beamforming configuration across all slots.

Drawing\non the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, VAPO enforces a structured \"Look\nbefore Transcription\" procedure using a <think><answer> format. Specifically,\nthe model first performs OCR on the slide content within the think step, then\ngenerates the transcription by referencing this recognized visual information\nin the answer step. This reasoning process is optimized via reinforcement\nlearning with four distinct rewards targeting format compliance, OCR accuracy,\nASR quality, and visual anchoring consistency. To support further research, we\nconstruct SlideASR-Bench, a new entity-rich benchmark consisting of a synthetic\ndataset for training and testing, and a challenging real-world set for\nevaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VAPO significantly improves\nrecognition of domain-specific terms, establishing an effective end-to-end\nparadigm for SlideASR."}

By enforcing non-negativity constraints through projected\ngradient descent, we obtain decompositions where internal weights and\nactivations can be directly interpreted as spectral shapes and temporal\nenvelopes, and where components can themselves be listened to as individual\nsound events. In particular, multi-layer Deep NAE architectures enable\nhierarchical representations with an adjustable level of granularity, allowing\nsounds to be deconstructed at multiple levels of abstraction: from high-level\nnote envelopes down to fine-grained spectral details. This framework enables a\nwide new range of expressive, controllable, and randomized sound\ntransformations. We introduce novel manipulation operations including\ncross-component and cross-layer synthesis, hierarchical deconstructions, and\nseveral randomization strategies that control timbre and event density. Through\nvisualizations and resynthesis of practical examples, we demonstrate how NAEs\ncan serve as flexible and interpretable tools for object-based sound editing."}

We combine a range of self-supervised speech features\n(continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods\n(K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best\nsystem uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features.\nFaster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged\ncontinuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences.

In practice, it is\noften challenging to achieve the preferred bandwidth for an automotive\nmicrophone when considering limitations and constraints on microphone placement\ninside the cabin, and the automotive grade environmental robustness\nrequirements. On the other hand, there seems to be no consensus or sufficient\ndata on the effect of each microphone characteristic on the actual performance.\nAs an attempt to answer this question, we used noise signals recorded in real\nvehicles and under various driving conditions to experimentally study the\nrelationship between the microphones' characteristics and the final audio\nquality of speech communication and performance of ASR engines. We focus on how\nvariations in microphone bandwidth and amplitude frequency response shapes\naffect the perceptual speech quality.

However, when the number of microphones\nof the training mixtures decreases, the MC constraint weakens and the\nseparation performance falls dramatically. To address this, we propose\nVM-UNSSOR, augmenting the observed training mixture signals recorded by a\nlimited number of microphones with several higher-SNR virtual-microphone (VM)\nsignals, which are obtained by applying linear spatial demixers (such as IVA\nand spatial clustering) to the observed training mixtures.

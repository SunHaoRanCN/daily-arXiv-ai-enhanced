This survey provides\na comprehensive overview of the modern era of ASR, charting its evolution from\ntraditional hybrid systems, such as Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Models\n(GMM-HMMs) and Deep Neural Network-HMMs (DNN-HMMs), to the now-dominant\nend-to-end neural architectures. We systematically review the foundational\nend-to-end paradigms: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC),\nattention-based encoder-decoder models, and the Recurrent Neural Network\nTransducer (RNN-T), which established the groundwork for fully integrated\nspeech-to-text systems. We then detail the subsequent architectural shift\ntowards Transformer and Conformer models, which leverage self-attention to\ncapture long-range dependencies with high computational efficiency. A central\ntheme of this survey is the parallel revolution in training paradigms. We\nexamine the progression from fully supervised learning, augmented by techniques\nlike SpecAugment, to the rise of self-supervised learning (SSL) with foundation\nmodels such as wav2vec 2.0, which drastically reduce the reliance on\ntranscribed data. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of largescale, weakly\nsupervised models like Whisper, which achieve unprecedented robustness through\nmassive data diversity. The paper also covers essential ecosystem components,\nincluding key datasets and benchmarks (e.g., LibriSpeech, Switchboard, CHiME),\nstandard evaluation metrics (e.g., Word Error Rate), and critical\nconsiderations for real-world deployment, such as streaming inference,\non-device efficiency, and the ethical imperatives of fairness and robustness.\nWe conclude by outlining open challenges and future research directions."}

In the\ntext-to-speech (TTS) task, current MLLM-based approaches rely on discrete token\nrepresentations, which disregard the inherently continuous nature of speech and\ncan lead to loss of fine-grained acoustic information.In this work, we\ninvestigate the TTS within the MLLM paradigm using continuous speech\nrepresentations. We design a dual-head architecture and implement two\ncomplementary training strategies for a robust model. (1) A diffusion head\ngenerating continuous speech representations is added on the MLLM, which is on\nframe-level and strictly autoregressive. (2) The original language model head\nis retained to preserve multitask capability and to control the start and end\nof speech synthesis.

Selecting the most relevant channels is\ncrucial for improving computational efficiency and ensuring robust insights\ninto neural dynamics. This study introduces the Importance of Channels based on\nEffective Connectivity (ICEC) criterion for quantifying effective connectivity\n(EC) in each channel. Effective connectivity refers to the causal influence one\nneural region exerts over another, providing insights into the directional flow\nof information. Using this criterion, we propose an unsupervised channel\nselection method that accounts for the intensity of interactions among\nchannels. To evaluate the proposed channel selection method, we applied it to\nthree well-known EEG datasets across four categories. The assessment involved\ncalculating the ICEC criterion using five effective connectivity metrics:\npartial directed coherence (PDC), generalized PDC (GPDC), renormalized PDC\n(RPDC), directed transfer function (DTF), and direct DTF (dDTF). To focus on\nthe effect of channel selection, we employed the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)\nalgorithm for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for\nclassification across all participants. Results were compared with other\nCSP-based methods. The evaluation included comparing participant- specific\naccuracies with and without the proposed method across five effective\nconnectivity metrics.

This paper investigates the sensing performance of\nOFDM-based ISAC for multi-target delay (range) estimation under specific radar\nreceiver processing schemes. An estimation-theoretic framework is developed to\ncharacterize sensing performance with random communication payloads. We\nestablish the fundamental limit of delay estimation accuracy by deriving the\nclosed-form expression of the mean-square error (MSE) achieved using matched\nfiltering (MF) and reciprocal filtering (RF) receivers. The results show that,\nin multi-target scenarios, the impact of signal constellations on the delay\nestimation MSE differs across receivers: MF performance depends on the\nfourth-order moment of the zero-mean, unit-power constellation in the presence\nof multiple targets, whereas RF performance depends on its inverse second-order\nmoment, irrespective of the number of targets. Building on this analysis, we\npresent a ISAC constellation design under specific receiver architecture that\nbrings a receiver-dependent flexible trade-off between sensing and\ncommunication in OFDM-ISAC systems.

This separation stems\nfrom inherent task conflicts and severe data imbalances, which impede the\ndevelopment of a truly unified audio generation model. To address this\nchallenge, we propose UniMoE-Audio, a unified speech and music generation model\nwithin a novel Dynamic-Capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework.\nArchitecturally, UniMoE-Audio introduces a Top-P routing strategy for dynamic\nexpert number allocation, and a hybrid expert design comprising routed experts\nfor domain-specific knowledge, shared experts for domain-agnostic features, and\nnull experts for adaptive computation skipping. To tackle data imbalance, we\nintroduce a three-stage training curriculum: 1) Independent Specialist Training\nleverages original datasets to instill domain-specific knowledge into each\n\"proto-expert\" without interference; 2) MoE Integration and Warmup incorporates\nthese specialists into the UniMoE-Audio architecture, warming up the gate\nmodule and shared expert using a subset of balanced dataset; and 3) Synergistic\nJoint Training trains the entire model end-to-end on the fully balanced\ndataset, fostering enhanced cross-domain synergy.

Early detection,\nespecially at the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage, is essential for\ntimely intervention. Working Memory (WM) impairment is a key early indicator of\nneurodegeneration, affecting higher cognitive processes. Electroencephalography\n(EEG), with its high temporal resolution, offers a cost-effective method to\nassess brain dynamics. This study investigates WM-related EEG functional\nconnectivity (FC) to identify brain network alterations across dementia stages.\nMethods: EEG signals were recorded from 24 participants (8 AD, 8 MCI, and 8\nhealthy controls) during WM tasks, including encoding, recall, and retrieval\nstages. Data preprocessing involved noise reduction and feature extraction\nusing Spherical and Head Harmonic Decomposition (SHD, HHD). FC was quantified\nusing Cross-Plot Transition Entropy (CPTE) and Phase Lag Index (PLI). Network\nmetrics such as Degree and Eigenvector Centrality were analyzed using Support\nVector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers. Results: The CPTE-based\nconnectivity metrics outperformed the traditional PLI approach in\ndifferentiating dementia stages, attaining a peak classification accuracy of\n97.53% during the retrieval phase with the Random Forest model. A connectivity\nthreshold of 0.5 was optimal for network discrimination. SHD and HHD features\nalso demonstrated strong discriminative potential. AD subjects exhibited higher\nsynchronization patterns during WM tasks than healthy controls. Conclusions:\nThe integration of WM tasks with EEG-based FC analysis provides a robust\nframework for dementia classification. The proposed CPTE-based approach offers\na robust, scalable, non-invasive, and effective diagnostic tool for early\ndetection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases."}

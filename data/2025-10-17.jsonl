Most training and evaluation datasets contain acted or\npseudo-acted speech (e.g., podcast speech) in which emotion expressions may be\nexaggerated or otherwise intentionally modified. Furthermore, datasets labeled\nbased on crowd perception often lack transparency regarding the guidelines\ngiven to annotators. These factors make it difficult to understand model\nperformance and pinpoint necessary areas for improvement. To address this gap,\nwe identified the Switchboard corpus as a promising source of naturalistic\nconversational speech, and we trained a crowd to label the dataset for\ncategorical emotions (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise,\nhappiness, tenderness, calmness, and neutral) and dimensional attributes\n(activation, valence, and dominance). We refer to this label set as\nSwitchboard-Affect (SWB-Affect). In this work, we present our approach in\ndetail, including the definitions provided to annotators and an analysis of the\nlexical and paralinguistic cues that may have played a role in their\nperception. In addition, we evaluate state-of-the-art SER models, and we find\nvariable performance across the emotion categories with especially poor\ngeneralization for anger. These findings underscore the importance of\nevaluation with datasets that capture natural affective variations in speech.\nWe release the labels for SWB-Affect to enable further analysis in this domain."}

A fundamental barrier is estimating the target signal when it is\nburied under strong co-channel interference from other transmitters, a failure\nof which renders the signal unusable. This work proposes a maximum likelihood\n(ML)-based cross-preamble estimation framework that exploits carrier frequency\noffset (CFO) constancy across beam-swept synchronization signals (SS),\ncoherently aggregating information across multiple observations to reinforce\nthe desired signal against overwhelming interference. Cramer-Rao lower bound\n(CRLB) analysis and simulation demonstrate reliable estimation even when the\nsignal is over a thousand times weaker than the interference. A low-altitude\nradio-map case study further verifies the framework's practical effectiveness."}

Millward", "Muralidhar Rangaswamy", "Muriel Medard"], "title": "Decoding in the presence of ISI without interleaving ORBGRAND AI", "comment": null, "summary": "Inter symbol interference (ISI), which occurs in a wide variety of channels,\nis a result of time dispersion. It can be mitigated by equalization which\nresults in noise coloring. For such colored noise, we propose a decoder called\nOrdered Reliability Bit Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (ORBGRANDAI)\nwhich is inspired by the development of approximate independence in statistical\nphysics. By foregoing interleaving, ORBGRAND-AI can deliver the same, or lower,\nblock error rate (BLER) for the same amount of energy per information bit in an\nISI channel as a state-of-the-art soft input decoder, such as Cyclic Redundancy\nCheck Assisted-Successive Cancellation List (CA-SCL) decoding, with an\ninterleaver. To assess the decoding performance of ORBGRAND-AI, we consider\ndelay tap models and their associated colored noise. In particular, we examine\na two-tap dicode ISI channel as well as an ISI channel derived from data from\nRFView, a physics-informed modeling and simulation tool. We investigate the\ndicode and RFView channel under a variety of imperfect channel state\ninformation assumptions and show that a second order autoregressive model\nadequately represents the RFView channel effect."}

### [1] [A Structured Family of Grassmannian Constellations via Geodesic Mapping for MIMO Noncoherent Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15070)
*Álvaro Pendás-Recondo,Enrique Pendás-Recondo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Grassmann流形测地线的新型结构化星座设计，用于MIMO非相干通信，具有单天线激活特性，能显著降低硬件复杂度和功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对MIMO非相干通信中缺乏信道状态信息的问题，设计一种既能利用Grassmann流形几何结构，又能降低硬件实现复杂度的星座方案。

Method: 基于Grassmann流形的测地曲线构建星座设计，确保每个时隙只有一个发射天线激活，从而简化硬件实现。

Result: 在星座尺寸限制内，误码性能与最先进的优化非结构化设计相当，同时将最大似然检测器的计算复杂度降低了M倍。

Conclusion: 该结构化星座设计在保持良好性能的同时，显著降低了硬件复杂度和功耗，为MIMO非相干通信提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a novel structured family of Grassmannian constellations
for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) noncoherent communications over
Rayleigh block-fading channels, where neither the transmitter nor the receiver
has channel state information (CSI). The proposed constellation design is built
upon the geodesic curves of the Grassmann manifold, thereby exploiting its
underlying geometric structure. The resulting solution is limited in spectral
efficiency (with a maximum constellation size of $4M^2$ points, where $M$ is
the number of transmit antennas), targeting a rate in the range of $0.25$-$1$
bps/Hz. However, all space-time matrices resulting from this design exhibit the
remarkable property of having a single nonzero entry per row, meaning that only
one transmit antenna is active per time slot. This property significantly
reduces hardware complexity and implementation cost, while also lowering power
consumption, as only a single power amplifier is required for transmission.
Furthermore, within the constellation size limits, the proposed design achieves
error performance comparable to state-of-the-art optimization-based
unstructured designs, as validated through symbol error rate (SER) numerical
results. It also enables simple yet effective bit labeling, confirmed by
comparisons of bit error rate (BER) and SER, and reduces the computational
complexity of the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector for Grassmannian
constellations by a factor of $M$.

### [2] [Pulse Shaping Filter Design for Integrated Sensing & Communication with Zak-OTFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15195)
*Nishant Mehrotra,Sandesh Rao Mattu,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过各向同性正交变换算法设计的最优脉冲整形滤波器，该滤波器同时满足定位性、正交性和带宽/时间限制三个目标，相比现有滤波器在通信和感知性能上都有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zak-OTFS框架在高延迟和多普勒扩展环境中用于集成感知与通信，但现有脉冲整形滤波器设计无法同时满足定位性（用于感知）、正交性（用于通信）和带宽/时间限制三个关键目标。

Method: 使用各向同性正交变换算法设计脉冲整形滤波器，确保滤波器同时具有定位性、正交性和带宽/时间限制特性。

Result: 提出的脉冲整形滤波器在数据检测（通信）和输入输出关系估计（感知）方面比文献中现有滤波器选择表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过各向同性正交变换算法设计的脉冲整形滤波器能够同时满足集成感知与通信的所有三个关键目标，为Zak-OTFS框架提供了理想的滤波器解决方案。

Abstract: Zak-OTFS is an emerging framework for integrated sensing & communication
(ISAC) in high delay and Doppler spread environments. A critical enabler for
ISAC with Zak-OTFS is the design of pulse shaping filters. For sensing, a
localized pulse shaping filter enables ideal input-output (I/O) relation
estimates close to the physical scattering channel. For communication,
orthogonality of the pulse shape on the information lattice prevents
inter-symbol interference, and no time and bandwidth expansion enables full
spectral efficiency. A filter simultaneously meeting all three objectives is
ideal for ISAC. Existing filter designs achieve two of the above objectives,
but not all three simultaneously. For instance, the sinc filter is orthogonal
and bandwidth/time-limited, but is not localized. The Gaussian filter is
localized and bandwidth/time-limited, but not orthogonal. The RRC filter is
localized and orthogonal, but not bandwidth/time-limited. A recently proposed
hybrid Gaussian-sinc filter is more localized than the sinc filter and
bandwidth/time-limited, but is not orthogonal. In this work, we design optimal
pulse shaping filters meeting all three objectives via the Isotropic Orthogonal
Transform Algorithm. The proposed pulse shaping filters offer improved data
detection (communication) and I/O relation estimation (sensing) performance
compared to existing filter choices in the literature.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多维生理特征的MIMO生物雷达生命体征增强检测方法，通过两阶段融合策略解决了传统等权重多通道信号融合效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人口老龄化加剧和慢性病负担增加，生命体征监测需求日益迫切。当前毫米波雷达非接触检测技术面临阵列雷达系统中基于等权重的多通道信号融合效率低的关键挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段融合策略：第一阶段基于生理特征的单通道信号增强检测，构建胸壁多散射点模型，选择有效距离单元并使用相位对齐最大比合并增强信噪比；第二阶段基于器官辐射空间分布特征的多通道融合，首次引入心肺器官空间辐射特征作为理论基础，提出模板匹配方法提取呼吸率和心率。

Abstract: With the intensiffcation of population aging and increasing burden of chronic
diseases, the demand for vital signs monitoring is becoming increasingly
urgent. A key challenge facing current non-contact detection technologies using
millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is the low efffciency of multi-channel signal
fusion in array radar systems based on equal weighting. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes a vital sign enhancement detection method for
multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) bio-radar, driven by multidimensional
physiological characteristics, which overcomes traditional limitations through
a two-stage fusion strategy. Stage 1: Enhanced Vital Sign Detection Using
Single-Channel Signals Based on Physiological Characteristics. First, a chest
wall multi-scattering point model is constructed. For single channel
time-distance two-dimensional echo signals, effective range bins are selected
based on the respiratory/cardiac physiological frequency band energy ratio, and
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of respiration/heart signals is enhanced using
phase-aligned maximal ratio combining (MRC). Stage 2: Multi-Channel Fusion
Based on Organ Radiation Spatial Distribution Characteristics. The spatial
radiation characteristics of cardiopulmonary organs are introduced for the
ffrst time as the theoretical foundation for SNR-based channel screening,
channel attribute identiffcation, and multi-channel weighted fusion. Then, we
propose a template matching method to extract respiratory rate (RR) and heart
rate (HR) by adopting physical models of respiration and cardiac activities.
The experimental results demonstrate the existence of the spatial distribution
characteristics of organ radiation. In addition, we analyzed the impact of
distance and state on the algorithm from these two aspects.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于ISAC基站测试的导电幅度和相位矩阵框架，能够模拟多目标的RCS、距离、角度和多普勒特性，解决了雷达目标模拟器接口有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实验室环境中对集成感知与通信基站进行全面评估面临挑战，主要是需要模拟具有任意RCS、距离、角度和多普勒特性的多个目标，而雷达目标模拟器的接口端口有限。

Method: 在测试配置中引入可调谐的导电幅度和相位调制网络，针对ISAC基站的两种感知操作模式（ADTR和SATR）研究相应配置，并通过两个单站感知场景进行实验验证。

Conclusion: 该框架在sub-6 GHz ISAC基站的开发和验证测试应用中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of the functionalities, algorithms, hardware
components, and performance characteristics of future integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) base stations (BSs) under realistic deployment scenarios
in controlled laboratory environments represents a critical requirement for
ISAC technology advancement. A primary challenge in achieving this objective
involves the emulation of multiple targets with arbitrary radar cross-section
(RCS), range, angle, and Doppler profiles for ISAC BS equipped with large-scale
antenna arrays using radar target simulator (RTS) with limited interface ports.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet highly effective and practical
conductive amplitude and phase matrix framework to address this fundamental
challenge. The core concept involves introducing a tunable conductive amplitude
and phase modulation network in the test configuration between the ISAC BS
under test and a RTS. Based on this structure, we subsequently investigate the
corresponding configurations for different sensing operational modes of ISAC
BSs, specifically the array duplex transmission and reception (ADTR) mode and
the split-array transmission and reception (SATR) mode. For experimental
validation, we design two distinct monostatic sensing scenarios to demonstrate
the framework capabilities across both operational modes. The first scenario
involves dynamic multi-drone sensing validation for ADTR mode operation, while
the second scenario addresses static single-drone sensing for SATR mode
validation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
can accurately emulate the joint RCS, range, velocity, and angular
characteristics of multiple sensing targets within the conductive test
environment, highlighting its significant potential for testing applications in
sub-6 GHz ISAC BS development and validation.

### [5] [Pseudo-Random TDM-MIMO FMCW Based Millimeter-Wave Sensing and Communication Integration for UAV Swarm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15575)

Conclusion: 所提出的ISAC方案能够有效支持无人机集群的协同操作，在动态环境下实现通信和感知的融合，为无人机应用提供了可行的技术解决方案。

Abstract: The integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) can achieve the sharing of
hardware and spectrum resources, enabling efficient data transmission and
environmental sensing. This fusion is particularly important for unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms, as it enhances the overall performance,
flexibility, and efficiency of such systems. To facilitate the collaborative
operations among UAVs, this paper proposes an ISAC solution based on the
pseudo-random time-division multiplexing (TDM)-multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW).
Specifically, a novel ISAC chirp waveform is proposed to modulate data in both
the delay domain and complex amplitude, while also possessing high-precision
sensing capabilities. To address challenges in the TDM-MIMO, we utilize the
pseudo-random antenna selection and compressed sensing algorithms, ensuring
that the maximum unambiguous velocity is not compromised. Moreover, by
employing a chirp-division multiple access scheme, we propose an
interference-free multiple antenna transmission scheme to achieve dynamic
allocation of time-frequency resources and multi-user transmission. Finally, we
propose a communication and sensing fusion-based dynamic iterative computation
scheme, simultaneously achieving data demodulation and sensing parameter
estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve ISAC
under the dynamic flight scenarios of UAVs. Meanwhile, the scheme outperforms
the mmWave-LoRadar in communication and sensing performance, yet its sensing
performance is slightly lower than that of the traditional FMCW. Under the
urban clutter modeling, the scheme still maintains favorable robustness despite
a certain degree of performance degradation.

stolz angle if the first derivative of harmonic function $f$ at the boundary is
positive infinity.

### [7] [Detection Seizure Onset Zone Using Circadian Fluctuating Epileptic Biomarkers: A Signal Processing and Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15717)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫生物标志物在识别癫痫发作起源中起关键作用，但这些标志物随时间变化显著。研究昼夜节律对生物标志物的影响，可以优化其在外科手术规划中的有效性。

Result: 分析了9名患者数据，睡眠/清醒状态分类的曲线下面积为84%。所有生物标志物率在睡眠阶段均高于清醒阶段，病理性高频振荡和尖峰序列在距离癫痫发作起源方面比尖峰或高频振荡更精确。

Conclusion: 睡眠阶段的癫痫生物标志物率与清醒阶段差异显著，分析睡眠数据能更准确地预测癫痫发作区域。这是首个使用包括高频振荡、尖峰序列和病理性高频振荡在内的综合生物标志物集来增强癫痫发作区域预测的研究。

Abstract: Epileptic biomarkers play a crucial role in identifying the origin of
seizures, an essential aspect of pre-surgical planning for epilepsy treatment.
These biomarkers can vary significantly over time. By studying these temporal
fluctuations, we can enhance their effectiveness in guiding surgical planning.
This research focuses on examining how circadian rhythms influence epilepsy
biomarkers and aims to determine the optimal times for their analysis. To
investigate the relationship between epilepsy biomarkers and circadian rhythm,
the sleep/wake states first need to be classified. After the biomarkers are
identified, they are compared across these states. A retrospective analysis was
conducted on intracranial electroencephalography data from patients with focal
epilepsy. The biomarkers spike, sequence of spikes, high-frequency oscillations
(HFOs), and pathological HFOs were identified through automatic detection. The
alpha/delta ratio was also calculated to distinguish between asleep and awake
stages. Data from 9 patients were analyzed, and the classification of sleep and
wake states was achieved with an area under the curve of 84%. All biomarker
rates were higher during the sleep stage compared to the wake stage.
Pathological HFOs and the sequence of spikes proved to be more precise
indicators regarding distance to seizure onset than spikes or HFOs. Unlike
previous studies that relied predominantly on long-term spike biomarker
analysis, this study is the first to utilize a comprehensive set of biomarkers,
including HFOs, spike sequences, and pathological HFOs, to enhance seizure
onset zone prediction. The rates of epilepsy biomarkers during sleep vary
considerably from those seen while awake, making sleep data analysis more
effective for accurately predicting the seizure onset zone.

### [8] [On the Impact of Electromagnetic Interference and Inter-RIS Reflections in Indoor Factory Local 6G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15759)
*Ishan Rangajith Koralege,Nurul Huda Mahmood,Arthur Sousa de Sena,Italo Atzeni*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文分析了6G网络中多RIS系统在室内工厂环境下的电磁干扰和RIS间反射问题，提出了一种基于黎曼共轭梯度法的交替优化算法来优化RIS相位配置，显著提升了系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G本地网络需要满足更高性能要求，但实际部署中RIS会受到外部电磁干扰和多RIS单元间反射的负面影响，这些联合效应会显著降低系统性能。

Method: 首先通过系统级仿真评估EMI和IRR的影响，然后提出基于黎曼共轭梯度法的交替优化算法，考虑信道空间相关性来优化RIS单元相位配置。

Result: 仿真表明EMI和IRR的联合影响比单独影响更严重，特别是在RIS尺寸和发射功率增加时。所提算法在系统总速率和中断概率方面带来了数个数量级的性能提升。

Conclusion: EMI和IRR是6G多RIS系统的重要性能限制因素，提出的优化算法能有效缓解这些负面影响，为实际部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The Sixth Generation (6G) radio technology is expected to include local 6G
networks as a special use case, extending the capabilities of `generic' 6G
networks towards more demanding performance requirements. Reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a novel paradigm for next-generation wireless
communications, especially in the context of local 6G networks, enabling
advanced signal propagation control through intelligent phase-shift
configurations. However, in practical deployments, their performance can be
adversely affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external sources
and inter-RIS reflections (IRR) caused by signal reflections between multiple
colocated RIS units. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the joint
impact of EMI and IRR in a multi-RIS multi-cell system deployed within an
indoor factory environment. A detailed evaluation study is first carried out to
investigate their impact on system performance. System-level simulations
demonstrate that the joint impact of EMI and IRR degrades system performance
more significantly than their individual effects, particularly as RIS
dimensions and transmit power increase. To address these adverse effects, an
alternate optimization algorithm using the Riemannian conjugate gradient method
is then proposed. The novel algorithm optimizes the phase shifts of the RIS
elements considering the spatial correlation among their associated channels,
and is found to provide up to several orders of magnitude gains in terms of the
system sum rate and the outage probability.

Conclusion: RIS辅助的原子MIMO接收机架构提供了一种低复杂度且有效的解决方案，能够处理相位对齐问题并简化接收机设计。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel and low-complexity atomic multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) receiver architecture assisted by a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS). By introducing RIS and utilizing pulse amplitude
modulation (PAM), the phase of the transmitted signal is effectively aligned
with that of the local oscillator (LO), thereby mitigating phase ambiguity and
substantially reducing both signal detection complexity and overall receiver
complexity.To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we
reformulate it into a tractable form by minimizing the Frobenius norm of an
equivalent matrix, which is efficiently solved using an Adam-based gradient
descent algorithm.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于里德堡原子量子(RAQ)的MIMO卫星在直接地面到空间上行链路接入中的性能优势，相比传统RF MIMO在瑞利和卫星信道条件下均表现出更优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RAQ-MIMO卫星系统以增强直接地面到空间上行链路接入性能，解决长距离传输场景下严格功率约束的挑战。

Method: 通过推导信道估计的均方误差和归一化均方误差的闭式表达式，分析里德堡原子对信道估计的影响；基于估计信道推导MRC和ZF检测方案的可实现数据率下界。

Result: RAQ-MIMO在瑞利衰落下实现"平方"增益，尤其在长距离传输场景；在LoS主导的卫星信道中，增益趋于饱和，主要来自归一化噪声背景的改善。蒙特卡洛仿真验证了分析结果。

Conclusion: RAQ-MIMO卫星的性能增益转化为更小的天线孔径、更低的发射功率和更长的通信距离，为下一代卫星网络铺平道路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance advantages of Rydberg atomic quantum
(RAQ)-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellites for enhancing
direct ground-to-space uplink access.We analytically evaluate the impact of
Rydberg atoms on channel estimation by deriving closed-form expressions for the
mean-square error (MSE) and normalized mean-square error (NMSE). Based on the
estimated channels, we further derive lower bounds on the achievable data rates
for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) detection schemes.
Rigorous analysis demonstrates that RAQ-MIMO outperforms conventional
radio-frequency (RF) MIMO under both Rayleigh and satellite channel conditions.
Specifically, compared with conventional MIMO, RAQR achieves a ``squaring" gain
under Rayleigh fading, especially in long-distance transmission scenarios with
stringent power constraints. In contrast, under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated
satellite channels, this gain saturates as channel-estimation benefits
diminish, with the remaining improvement primarily arising from the normalized
noise background. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results and
show that the performance gains of RAQ-MIMO satellites translate into smaller
antenna apertures, lower transmit power, and longer communication ranges,
thereby paving the way for next-generation satellite networks.

Conclusion: 通过将RAQR与SWIPT-MIMO集成，基站能够可靠地检测仅由收集能量供电的物联网设备的弱上行信号，实现无电池通信。

Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a hybrid simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT)-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
architecture, where the base station (BS) uses a conventional RF transmitter
for downlink transmission and a Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQR) for
receiving uplink signal from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To fully exploit
this integration, we jointly design the transmission scheme and the
power-splitting strategy to maximize the sum rate, which leads to a non-convex
problem. To address this challenge, we first derive closed-form lower bounds on
the uplink achievable rates for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing
(ZF), as well as on the downlink rate and harvested energy for maximum ratio
transmission (MRT) and ZF precoding. Building upon these bounds, we propose an
iterative algorithm relying on the best monomial approximation and geometric
programming (GP) to solve the non-convex problem. Finally, simulations validate
the tightness of our derived lower bounds and demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes. Importantly, by integrating RAQR
with SWIPT-enabled MIMO, the BS can reliably detect weak uplink signals from
IoT devices powered only by harvested energy, enabling battery-free
communication.

Motivation: 全双工ISAC系统需要在感知和通信任务之间有效分配资源，同时应对自干扰消除不完美带来的挑战，需要协调优化时隙分配和波束选择以提高系统效率。

Method: 将半无限非凸混合整数非线性规划问题通过定制化重构策略转化为可求解的混合整数线性规划问题，从而获得全局最优解。

Conclusion: 提出的重构策略成功解决了全双工ISAC系统中复杂的资源管理问题，为时隙分配和波束选择的协同优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work addresses the radio resource management (RRM) design in downlink
full-duplex integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, jointly
optimizing timeslot allocation and beam selection under imperfect
self-interference cancellation. Timeslot allocation governs the distribution of
discrete channel uses between sensing and communication tasks, while beam
selection determines transmit and receive directions along with adaptive
beamwidths. The joint design leads to a semi-infinite, nonconvex mixed-integer
nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve. To overcome this, we
develop a tailored reformulation strategy that transforms the problem into a
tractable mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling globally optimal
solutions. Our approach provides insights into the coordinated optimization of
timeslot allocation and beam selection, enhancing the efficiency of full-duplex
ISAC systems while ensuring resilience against residual self-interference.

Motivation: 现有无人机音频感知系统受极端自噪声影响，且缺乏真实声学交互数据和标准化设置，限制了无人机听觉系统的发展。

Method: 创建了一个全面的无人机听觉数据集，包含各种信噪比范围、无人机类型、油门设置、麦克风配置和环境条件的标注录音。

Result: 提供了23.5小时的标注音频数据，SNR范围从-57.2 dB到-2.5 dB，支持噪声抑制和分类方法的开发和系统评估。

Conclusion: 该数据集是推动无人机听觉系统设计和部署的重要一步，为实际设计考虑（如麦克风放置权衡）和无人机噪声感知音频处理提供了基础。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones, are increasingly used in search
and rescue missions to detect human presence. Existing systems primarily
leverage vision-based methods which are prone to fail under low-visibility or
occlusion. Drone-based audio perception offers promise but suffers from extreme
ego-noise that masks sounds indicating human presence. Existing datasets are
either limited in diversity or synthetic, lacking real acoustic interactions,
and there are no standardized setups for drone audition. To this end, we
present DroneAudioset (The dataset is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ahlab-drone-project/DroneAudioSet/ under the
MIT license), a comprehensive drone audition dataset featuring 23.5 hours of
annotated recordings, covering a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)
from -57.2 dB to -2.5 dB, across various drone types, throttles, microphone
configurations as well as environments. The dataset enables development and
systematic evaluation of noise suppression and classification methods for
human-presence detection under challenging conditions, while also informing
practical design considerations for drone audition systems, such as microphone
placement trade-offs, and development of drone noise-aware audio processing.
This dataset is an important step towards enabling design and deployment of
drone-audition systems.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态时间规整的模板式开放集少样本关键词检测阈值估计方法，通过量化嵌入和利用量化误差归一化检测分数来改进阈值选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键词检测系统需要阈值化连续检测分数，但传统基于验证集优化的阈值选择方法在未见数据上表现不佳，特别是在变化或嘈杂的声学环境或少样本设置中。

Method: 提出分数校准方法：量化嵌入向量，并使用量化误差在阈值化前归一化检测分数。

Result: 在模拟高频无线电通道的KWS-DailyTalk数据集上实验表明，该方法简化了检测阈值的选择并显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的校准方法有效缓解了次优阈值导致的性能下降问题，在嘈杂语音数据上改善了模板式开放集少样本关键词检测的阈值估计。

Abstract: Detecting occurrences of keywords with keyword spotting (KWS) systems
requires thresholding continuous detection scores. Selecting appropriate
thresholds is a non-trivial task, typically relying on optimizing the
performance on a validation dataset. However, such greedy threshold selection
often leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, particularly in varying
or noisy acoustic environments or few-shot settings. In this work, we
investigate detection threshold estimation for template-based open-set few-shot
KWS using dynamic time warping on noisy speech data. To mitigate the
performance degradation caused by suboptimal thresholds, we propose a score
calibration approach consisting of two different steps: quantizing embeddings
and normalizing detection scores using the quantization error prior to
thresholding. Experiments on KWS-DailyTalk with simulated high frequency radio
channels show that the proposed calibration approach simplifies the choice of
detection thresholds and significantly improves the resulting performance.

TL;DR: 提出LDCodec，一种解码器复杂度低的神经音频编解码器，在6kbps比特率下性能优于Opus在12kbps的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经音频编解码器在极低比特率下优于传统方法，但实际应用受限于高复杂度，特别是针对智能手机等流媒体客户端

Method: 采用新型残差单元结合长短时残差向量量化(LSRVQ)、子带-全带频率鉴别器和感知损失函数

Result: 主观和客观测试均显示，LDCodec在6kbps比特率下性能优于Opus在12kbps的表现

Conclusion: LDCodec实现了高质量音频重建与低复杂度的平衡，特别适用于流媒体客户端应用

Abstract: Neural audio coding has been shown to outperform classical audio coding at
extremely low bitrates. However, the practical application of neural audio
codecs is still limited by their elevated complexity. To address this
challenge, we have developed a high-quality neural audio codec with a
low-complexity decoder, named LDCodec (Low-complexity Decoder Neural Audio
Codec), specifically designed for on-demand streaming media clients, such as
smartphones. Specifically, we introduced a novel residual unit combined with
Long-term and Short-term Residual Vector Quantization (LSRVQ), subband-fullband
frequency discriminators, and perceptual loss functions. This combination
results in high-quality audio reconstruction with lower complexity. Both our
subjective and objective tests demonstrated that our proposed LDCodec at 6kbps
outperforms Opus at 12kbps.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了两种与噪声类型无关的数据清洗方法，通过数据归因和感知距离来识别和过滤低质量训练样本，显著提升音乐源分离模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在音乐源分离任务中的性能严重依赖训练数据质量，但数据集常包含难以检测的伪影和标签噪声，且污染类型和程度通常未知，针对特定污染的清洗方法往往不实用。

Method: 1. 基于遗忘的数据归因方法：识别并过滤对产生干净输出贡献最小的训练样本；2. 利用Fr\'echet音频距离：测量并移除与小型可信干净参考集感知差异较大的样本。

Result: 在模拟真实世界噪声污染的数据集上，基于遗忘的方法产生的清洗数据集和相应模型优于原始污染数据和小型干净参考集，填补了污染基线与无污染模型之间约66.7%的性能差距。

Conclusion: 与针对特定伪影的方法不同，这些与噪声类型无关的方法为策划高质量训练数据提供了更通用和广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models for music source separation heavily
depends on training data quality. However, datasets are often corrupted by
difficult-to-detect artifacts such as audio bleeding and label noise. Since the
type and extent of contamination are typically unknown, cleaning methods
targeting specific corruptions are often impractical. This paper proposes and
evaluates two distinct, noise-agnostic data cleaning methods to address this
challenge. The first approach uses data attribution via unlearning to identify
and filter out training samples that contribute the least to producing clean
outputs. The second leverages the Fr\'echet Audio Distance to measure and
remove samples that are perceptually dissimilar to a small and trusted clean
reference set. On a dataset contaminated with a simulated distribution of
real-world noise, our unlearning-based methods produced a cleaned dataset and a
corresponding model that outperforms both the original contaminated data and
the small clean reference set used for cleaning. This result closes
approximately 66.7\% of the performance gap between the contaminated baseline
and a model trained on the same dataset without any contamination. Unlike
methods tailored for specific artifacts, our noise-agnostic approaches offer a
more generic and broadly applicable solution for curating high-quality training
data.

TL;DR: 提出MC-LExt框架，通过将目标说话人的注册语音前置到多通道混合信号中，实现端到端的多通道目标说话人提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖DOA或说话人嵌入，但DOA方法对麦克风阵列几何敏感，说话人嵌入方法在噪声混响环境中性能下降。

Method: 将目标说话人的短注册语音前置到每个通道的混合信号中，作为起始提示条件信号，让DNN联合学习空间和说话人身份线索。

Result: 在WHAMR!和MC-Libri2Mix等噪声混响基准测试中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: MC-LExt是一个简单但高效的多通道目标说话人提取框架，能够端到端地学习空间和说话人身份信息。

Abstract: Multi-channel target speaker extraction (MC-TSE) aims to extract a target
speaker's voice from multi-speaker signals captured by multiple microphones.
Existing methods often rely on auxiliary clues such as direction-of-arrival
(DOA) or speaker embeddings. However, DOA-based approaches depend on explicit
direction estimation and are sensitive to microphone array geometry, while
methods based on speaker embeddings model speaker identity in an implicit
manner and may degrade in noisy-reverberant conditions. To address these
limitations, we propose multi-channel listen to extract (MC-LExt), a simple but
highly-effective framework for MC-TSE. Our key idea is to prepend a short
enrollment utterance of the target speaker to each channel of the multi-channel
mixture, providing an onset-prompted conditioning signal that can guide TSE.
This design allows the deep neural network (DNN) to learn spatial and speaker
identity cues jointly in a fully end-to-end manner. Experiments on
noisy-reverberant benchmarks, including WHAMR! and MC-Libri2Mix, demonstrate
the effectiveness of MC-TSE.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用共注意力机制的特征级融合框架，将幅度和相位域特征结合用于说话人识别，在VoxCeleb数据集上取得了97.20%的Top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征级融合方法通常忽略幅度和相位域中说话人语义的独特贡献，需要更有效地融合这两个域的特征。

Method: 构建了两个分别处理幅度和相位域的子网络，通过共注意力机制在池化层前融合中间高层输出，利用相关性矩阵动态调整两个域的权重贡献。

Result: 在VoxCeleb数据集上，Top-1准确率达到97.20%，比最先进系统绝对提升0.82%，相比单特征FBank系统EER降低0.45%。

Conclusion: 基于共注意力机制的特征级融合策略能有效结合幅度和相位域特征，显著提升说话人识别性能。

Abstract: Phase-based features related to vocal source characteristics can be
incorporated into magnitude-based speaker recognition systems to improve the
system performance. However, traditional feature-level fusion methods typically
ignore the unique contributions of speaker semantics in the magnitude and phase
domains. To address this issue, this paper proposed a feature-level fusion
framework using the co-attention mechanism for speaker recognition. The
framework consists of two separate sub-networks for the magnitude and phase
domains respectively. Then, the intermediate high-level outputs of both domains
are fused by the co-attention mechanism before a pooling layer. A correlation
matrix from the co-attention module is supposed to re-assign the weights for
dynamically scaling contributions in the magnitude and phase domains according
to different pronunciations. Experiments on VoxCeleb showed that the proposed
feature-level fusion strategy using the co-attention mechanism gave the Top-1
accuracy of 97.20%, outperforming the state-of-the-art system with 0.82%
absolutely, and obtained EER reduction of 0.45% compared to single feature
system using FBank.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SpikeVox是一个基于脉冲驱动生成语言模型的节能语音治疗框架，能够准确识别语音障碍并提供治疗建议反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音治疗解决方案（如治疗师或工具）有限且昂贵，无法满足全球数百万患者的需求。现有神经网络方法虽然能检测语音障碍，但不提供治疗建议反馈，且能耗高难以在低功耗平台上部署。

Method: SpikeVox采用语音识别模块进行高精度语音转文本；利用脉冲驱动生成语言模型高效进行语音障碍模式分析并生成合适的治疗练习；提供正确发音指导作为反馈；使用REST API实现用户无缝交互。

Result: 实验结果显示SpikeVox在语音障碍识别方面平均达到88%的置信度，同时提供完整的治疗练习反馈。

Conclusion: SpikeVox为节能语音治疗解决方案提供了一个全面框架，有望解决全球语音治疗获取差距问题。

Abstract: Speech disorders can significantly affect the patients capability to
communicate, learn, and socialize. However, existing speech therapy solutions
(e.g., therapist or tools) are still limited and costly, hence such solutions
remain inadequate for serving millions of patients worldwide. To address this,
state-of-the-art methods employ neural network (NN) algorithms to help
accurately detecting speech disorders. However, these methods do not provide
therapy recommendation as feedback, hence providing partial solution for
patients. Moreover, these methods incur high energy consumption due to their
complex and resource-intensive NN processing, hence hindering their deployments
on low-power/energy platforms (e.g., smartphones). Toward this, we propose
SpikeVox, a novel framework for enabling energy-efficient speech therapy
solutions through spike-driven generative language model. Specifically,
SpikeVox employs a speech recognition module to perform highly accurate
speech-to-text conversion; leverages a spike-driven generative language model
to efficiently perform pattern analysis for speech disorder detection and
generates suitable exercises for therapy; provides guidance on correct
pronunciation as feedback; as well as utilizes the REST API to enable seamless
interaction for users. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeVox achieves
88% confidence level on average in speech disorder recognition, while providing
a complete feedback for therapy exercises. Therefore, SpikeVox provides a
comprehensive framework for energy-efficient speech therapy solutions, and
potentially addresses the significant global speech therapy access gap.

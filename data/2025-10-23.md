*Tomer Shaked,Philipp del Hougne,George C. Alexandropoulos,Nir Shlezinger*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于AI辅助退火Langevin动态(ALD)的快速优化方法，无需显式信道建模，通过深度展开ALD算法和DNN估计梯度，在复杂动态环境中优化可重构智能表面(RIS)参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要简单信道模型来支持快速优化，但实际中这些模型往往是粗略近似，而更准确的描述需要复杂仿真或测量。需要一种能绕过显式信道建模的快速优化方法。

Method: 使用AI辅助退火Langevin动态(ALD)，通过深度展开ALD算法，利用DNN估计梯度，结合零阶梯度和主动学习的训练方法，在无需信道建模的情况下优化信道参数。

Result: 在受丰富散射效应影响的RIS辅助场景中评估，AI-aided ALD方法能够实现快速可靠的信道参数调谐，具有有限的延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂动态环境中的信道参数优化提供了一种有效的解决方案，无需依赖显式信道建模。

Abstract: Emerging technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) make
it possible to optimize some parameters of wireless channels. Conventional
approaches require relating the channel and its programmable parameters via a
simple model that supports rapid optimization, e.g., re-tuning the parameters
each time the users move. However, in practice such models are often crude
approximations of the channel, and a more faithful description can be obtained
via complex simulators, or only by measurements. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach for rapid optimization of programmable channels based on
AI-aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD), which bypasses the need for explicit
channel modeling. By framing the ALD algorithm using the MAP estimate, we
design a deep unfolded ALD algorithm that leverages a Deep Neural Network (DNN)
to estimate score gradients for optimizing channel parameters. We introduce a
training method that overcomes the need for channel modeling using zero-order
gradients, combined with active learning to enhance generalization, enabling
optimization in complex and dynamically changing environments. We evaluate the
proposed method in RIS-aided scenarios subject to rich-scattering effects. Our
results demonstrate that our AI-aided ALD method enables rapid and reliable
channel parameter tuning with limited latency.

### [2] [Fundamental Limits of Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communications over Low-Earth Orbit THz Satellite Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19007)
*Haofan Dong,Houtianfu Wang,Hanlin Cai,Ozgur B. Akan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一个网络克拉美-罗下界(N-CRLB)框架来分析太赫兹星间链路的感知精度，考虑了动态拓扑、硬件损伤、相位噪声和网络干扰等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太赫兹星间链路在低地球轨道星座中能实现前所未有的感知精度，但受到硬件损伤、指向误差和网络干扰的基本限制，需要系统性的分析框架。

Method: 开发了网络CRLB框架，结合动态拓扑、硬件质量因子Γ_eff、相位噪声σ²_φ，并通过递归Fisher信息分析来考虑协作效应。

Result: 发现三个关键见解：硬件和相位噪声造成功率无关的性能上限和下限；干扰系数α_ℓm在特定条件下可实现5.5dB的感知增益；共享定时参考的测量相关性不会降低性能，反而能提供共模抑制优势。

Conclusion: 亚毫米级测距需要硬件(Γ_eff<0.01)、振荡器(σ²_φ<10⁻²)和适当3D几何配置的协同优化。

Abstract: Terahertz inter-satellite links enable unprecedented sensing precision for
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, yet face fundamental bounds from hardware
impairments, pointing errors, and network interference. We develop a Network
Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (N-CRLB) framework incorporating dynamic topology,
hardware quality factor $\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$, phase noise $\sigma^2_\phi$, and
cooperative effects through recursive Fisher Information analysis. Our analysis
reveals three key insights: (i) hardware and phase noise create
power-independent performance ceilings ($\sigma_{\text{ceiling}} \propto
\sqrt{\Gamma_{\text{eff}}}$) and floors ($\sigma_{\text{floor}} \propto
\sqrt{\sigma^2_\phi}/f_c$), with power-only scaling saturating above
$\text{SNR}_{\text{crit}}=1/\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$; (ii) interference
coefficients $\alpha_{\ell m}$ enable opportunistic sensing with demonstrated
gains of 5.5~dB under specific conditions (65~dB processing gain, 50~dBi
antennas); (iii) measurement correlations from shared timing references, when
properly modeled, do not degrade performance and can provide common-mode
rejection benefits compared to mismodeled independent-noise baselines.
Sub-millimeter ranging requires co-optimized hardware
($\Gamma_{\text{eff}}<0.01$), oscillators ($\sigma^2_\phi<10^{-2}$), and
appropriate 3D geometry configurations.

*Anna Cetera,Sima Ghafoori,Ali Rabiee,Mohammad Hassan Farhadi,Yalda Shahriari,Reza Abiri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于视觉的抓握平台，使用EEG神经影像技术研究抓握类型特异性（精确抓握、力量抓握、无抓握）的神经活动。研究发现低频振荡（0.5-8 Hz）在规划和执行阶段都携带抓握相关信息，分类性能优于传统MRCP方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然侵入式记录已成功解码与抓握类型规划和执行相关的局部神经活动，但非侵入性脑电图（EEG）捕获的宏观神经激活模式仍知之甚少。本研究旨在探索大规模脑网络中抓握类型特异性的神经活动。

Method: 开发了新型视觉抓握平台，在自然视觉运动任务中分离抓握特异性规划与执行阶段。使用Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern（FBCSP）技术提取各阶段中具有区分性的频率特异性特征，并通过支持向量机（SVM）进行分类。

Result: 低频振荡（0.5-8 Hz）在规划和执行阶段都携带抓握相关信息，精确抓握vs力量抓握的分类准确率达75.3-77.8%，优于MRCP的61.1%。高频活动（12-40 Hz）显示阶段依赖性结果，抓握vs无抓握分类准确率达93.3%。SVM系数识别出规划阶段前额顶叶网络和执行阶段运动网络中的区分性特征。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了低频振荡在使用非侵入性EEG解码规划阶段抓握类型中的作用，为理解视觉抓握脑网络提供了新的见解。

Abstract: The vision-based grasping brain network integrates visual perception with
cognitive and motor processes for visuomotor tasks. While invasive recordings
have successfully decoded localized neural activity related to grasp type
planning and execution, macroscopic neural activation patterns captured by
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) remain far less understood. We
introduce a novel vision-based grasping platform to investigate
grasp-type-specific (precision, power, no-grasp) neural activity across
large-scale brain networks using EEG neuroimaging. The platform isolates
grasp-specific planning from its associated execution phases in naturalistic
visuomotor tasks, where the Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP)
technique was designed to extract discriminative frequency-specific features
within each phase. Support vector machine (SVM) classification discriminated
binary (precision vs. power, grasp vs. no-grasp) and multiclass (precision vs.
power vs. no-grasp) scenarios for each phase, and were compared against
traditional Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) methods. Low-frequency
oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) carry grasp-related information established during
planning and maintained throughout execution, with consistent classification
performance across both phases (75.3-77.8\%) for precision vs. power
discrimination, compared to 61.1\% using MRCP. Higher-frequency activity (12-40
Hz) showed phase-dependent results with 93.3\% accuracy for grasp vs. no-grasp
classification but 61.2\% for precision vs. power discrimination. Feature
importance using SVM coefficients identified discriminative features within
frontoparietal networks during planning and motor networks during execution.
This work demonstrated the role of low-frequency oscillations in decoding grasp
type during planning using noninvasive EEG.

*Yining Li,Ziwei Wan,Chongjia Sun,Kaijun Feng,Keke Ying,Wenyan Ma,Lipeng Zhu,Xiaodan Shao,Zhenyu Xiao,Zhen Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了移动可重构天线(MARA)的统一建模框架，整合了几何可移动天线(GMA)和电磁可重构天线(ERA)的优化，研究了信道建模和频谱效率优化，并系统回顾了AI在解决高维非凸优化问题中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G系统向智能化和高可重构性发展，传统固定天线的局限性日益突出，GMA和ERA成为突破瓶颈的关键技术，但它们形成的"几何-电磁双重构"范式给信号处理带来了高维混合优化的严峻挑战。

Method: 首次整合GMA的几何优化和ERA的电磁重构，提出MARA的统一建模框架，研究GMA、ERA和MARA的信道建模和频谱效率优化，并系统回顾基于AI的解决方案。

Result: 填补了现有文献在几何-电磁双重构下AI驱动信号处理范式缺乏全面综述的空白，为设计具有高频谱效率和灵活性的6G无线系统提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: 本文提出的MARA框架和AI驱动方法为6G无线通信系统的高维优化问题提供了有效解决方案，推动了智能可重构天线技术的发展。

Abstract: As 6G wireless communication systems evolve toward intelligence and high
reconfigurability, the limitations of traditional fixed antenna (TFA) has
become increasingly prominent, with geometrically movable antenna (GMA) and
electromagnetically reconfigurable antenna (ERA) emerging as key technologies
to break through this bottleneck. GMA activates spatial degrees of freedom
(DoF) by dynamically adjusting antenna positions, ERA regulates radiation
characteristics using tunable metamaterials, thereby introducing DoF in the
electromagnetic domain. However, the ``geometric-electromagnetic dual
reconfiguration" paradigm formed by their integration poses severe challenges
of high-dimensional hybrid optimization to signal processing. To address this
issue, we integrate the geometric optimization of GMA and the electromagnetic
reconfiguration of ERA for the first time, propose a unified modeling framework
for movable and reconfigurable antenna (MARA), investigate the channel modeling
and spectral efficiency (SE) optimization for GMA, ERA, and MARA. Besides, we
systematically review artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, focusing on
analyzing the advantages of AI over traditional algorithms in high-dimensional
non-convex optimization computations. This paper fills the gap in existing
literature regarding the lack of a comprehensive review on the AI-driven signal
processing paradigm under geometric-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration and
provides theoretical support for the design and optimization of 6G wireless
systems with high SE and flexibility.

### [5] [Generalized Modified Blake-Zisserman Robust Spline Adaptive Filter for Generalized Gaussian Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19256)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了广义修正Blake-Zisserman鲁棒样条自适应滤波(SAF-GMBZ)算法，解决了传统SAF算法在广义高斯噪声和脉冲噪声环境下的性能退化问题，并在主动噪声控制应用中开发了FcGMBZ算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAF算法在广义高斯噪声环境下性能下降，在脉冲噪声下稳态失调严重，且未能有效处理异常值的影响。

Method: 提出了SAF-GMBZ算法，基于信息理论学习，计算了步长的均值收敛范围和稳态均方误差，并进一步开发了用于主动噪声控制的FcGMBZ算法。

Result: 仿真结果验证了理论稳态MSE的准确性，SAF-GMBZ在广义高斯噪声环境下表现出优越性能，FcGMBZ在脉冲噪声环境下的主动噪声控制中有效。

Conclusion: SAF-GMBZ算法在广义高斯噪声环境下具有优越的学习性能，FcGMBZ算法在脉冲噪声环境下的主动噪声控制应用中表现出良好的收敛精度和噪声消除能力。

Abstract: The spline adaptive filtering (SAF) algorithm-based information-theoretic
learning has exhibited strong convergence performance in nonlinear system
identification (NSI), establishing SAF as a promising framework for adaptive
filtering. However, existing SAF-based methods suffer from performance
degradation under generalized Gaussian noise (GGN) environment and exhibit
significant steady-state misalignment under impulse noise. Moreover, prior
research on SAF algorithms has not effectively addressed the adverse effects
caused by outliers. To overcome these challenges, the generalized modified
Blake-Zisserman robust spline adaptive filtering (SAF-GMBZ) algorithm is
proposed. Compared to conventional SAF algorithms, SAF-GMBZ exhibits superior
learning performance in GGN. Furthermore, the mean convergence ranges of the
step-sizes and the steady-state mean-square error (MSE) are calculated by
introducing the commonly utilized assumptions. To arrive at good convergence
accuracy and noise cancellation capability in active noise control (ANC)
application, the filter-c GMBZ (FcGMBZ) algorithm is further developed based on
SAF-GMBZ. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the theoretical
steady-state MSE, and the superiority of the SAF-GMBZ algorithm under GGN
environment in NSI, along with the effectiveness of the FcGMBZ algorithm in ANC
application under impulsive noise environment.

### [6] [A Study on Delay Assessment for Heterogenous Traffic in VANET](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19267)
*Shama Siddiqu,Indrakshi Dey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文比较了VANET中的802.11p标准和FROG-MAC协议，发现FROG-MAC通过分片传输机制为紧急数据提供更早的信道访问，从而降低了延迟并提高了吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VANET中多优先级异构节点产生的数据需要差异化服务，但802.11p标准在非关键数据开始传输时，关键数据节点必须等待，这可能导致紧急消息延迟。

Method: 研究比较了802.11p标准和FROG-MAC协议，FROG-MAC通过将普通数据包分片传输并在分片间设置短暂间隔，让紧急数据包能在这些间隔期间访问信道。

Result: 模拟评估显示，FROG-MAC在高优先级和低优先级数据的延迟和吞吐量方面都表现更好，因为其为紧急流量提供了更早的信道访问。

Conclusion: FROG-MAC通过分片传输机制有效改善了VANET中紧急数据的传输性能，降低了延迟并提高了吞吐量。

Abstract: Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) comprise of multi-priority hetero-genous
nodes, both stationary and/or mobile. The data generated by these nodes may
include messages relating to information, safety, entertainment, traffic
management and emergency alerts. The data in the network needs dif-ferentiated
service based on the priority/urgency. Media Access Control (MAC) protocols
hold a significant value for managing the data priority. This paper studies a
comparison of 802.11p which is a standard PHY and MAC protocol for VANET with a
fragmentation-based protocol, FROG-MAC. The major design principle of 802.11-p
is to allow direct Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
communication without associa-tion, using Enhanced Distributed Channel Access
(EDCA) to prioritize safety-critical messages. However, if non-critical
messages already start to transmit, the nodes with critical data have to wait.
FROG-MAC reduces this delay by transmitting normal packets in fragments with
short pauses between them, al-lowing urgent packets to access the channel
during these intervals. Simula-tions have been performed to assess the delay
and throughput for high and low priority data. We report that FROG-MAC improves
both the performance parameters due to offering an early channel access to the
emergency traffic.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 使用物联网技术监测巴基斯坦高中教师的睡眠质量，发现睡眠质量与认知功能存在显著关联，大多数教师睡眠质量差且认知功能不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高中教师因工作压力大和多任务要求，经常面临睡眠质量和认知功能问题，这对教学能力产生负面影响。

Method: 使用嵌入脉搏率和血氧传感器的智能手表监测睡眠质量，将其分为"差"、"一般"或"好"，并使用认知评估问卷进行自我评估。

Result: 研究发现大多数教师睡眠质量差且认知功能不佳，两者之间存在明显关联。

Conclusion: 需要改善教师的工作量和其他因素以确保他们的福祉，这将对其教学质量产生积极影响。

Abstract: Sleep quality is an important indicator of the efficient cognitive function
for high school teachers. Due to the high work stress and multi-tasking
expectations, the teachers often face issues with their sleep quality and
cognitive function, which has a clearly negative influence on their teaching
abilities. In this work, we propose a unique but simple method of deploying
Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the sleep quality of high school
teachers at Pakistan. Smart watches embedded with pulse rate and SpO2 sensors
were used to collect data and categorize the sleep quality as "poor", "fair" or
"good". Moreover, we used a psychological tool, Cognitive Assessment
Questionnaire (CAQ) for the self-assessment of teachers' cognitive function.
The study was conducted over 208 high school teachers from across Pakistan. It
has been found that most of the teachers had a poor sleep quality and cognitive
function; The link between these two variables indicate that the workload and
other factors must be improved for the teachers to ensure their well-being,
which will in turn have a positive impact on their teaching quality.

Conclusion: 证明了在增材制造中使用低功耗神经形态芯片进行异常检测的可行性，并为该过程创建了一个有效的检测框架。

Abstract: This study is the first application of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
anomaly detection in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing
process. The neural networks were used to identify print processing anomalies
generated by dropping of laser energy during the printing of individual layers
in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy lattice structures. Associated changes in the laser
generated melt pool were observed using an in-process photodiode monitoring
technique. photodiode sensors capturing plasma and infrared radiations
reflected from the print bed of the metal 3D printer were utilized to detect
sudden changes caused by anomalies during the printing process. The algorithm
is first implemented on non-neuromorphic hardware including a central
processing unit (CPU), on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and then on
neuromorphic Intel's Loihi chip. Improved detection of anomalies is achieved by
adjusting the spike latency of the neural network, which reduces masking of
information by noise within the monitored temporal signal. The work
demonstrates the possibility of using low-power neuromorphic chips within an
edge framework for anomaly detection in additive manufacturing and creates a
framework for the process.

Conclusion: 提出的动态码率调整框架有效解决了多边缘协同推理系统中的通信效率问题，为AI驱动的物联网任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with the internet of things
(IoT) enables task-oriented communication for multi-edge cooperative inference
system, where edge devices transmit extracted features of local sensory data to
an edge server to perform AI-driven tasks. However, the privacy concerns and
limited communication bandwidth pose fundamental challenges, since simultaneous
transmission of extracted features with a single fixed compression ratio from
all devices leads to severe inefficiency in communication resource utilization.
To address this challenge, we propose a framework that dynamically adjusts the
code rate in feature extraction based on its importance to the downstream
inference task by adopting a rate-adaptive quantization (RAQ) scheme.
Furthermore, to select the code rate for each edge device under limited
bandwidth constraint, a dynamic programming (DP) approach is leveraged to
allocate the code rate across discrete code rate options. Experiments on
multi-view datasets demonstrate that the proposed frameworks significantly
outperform the frameworks using fixed-rate quantization, achieving a favorable
balance between communication efficiency and inference performance under
limited bandwidth conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates narrow-beam channel characterization and performance
evaluation for 5G for railway (5G-R) systems based on ray-tracing (RT)
simulation. Three representative high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios including
viaduct, cutting, and station are established, and RT-based dynamic narrow-beam
channel simulations are conducted using a designed beam tracking scheme that
ensures continuous alignment with the moving train. The channel characteristics
are analyzed in terms of both large-scale and small-scale fading, as well as
non-stationarity, providing statistical insights into path loss, shadow fading,
fading severity, time-frequency-space dispersion, and stationarity interval.
The influence of beamwidth on these channel properties is also examined.
Furthermore, the performance of 5G-R systems operating in such narrow-beam
channels is evaluated using the Vienna 5G simulator, with a focus on block
error rate, throughput, and spectral efficiency. A hardware-in-the-loop
simulation platform is developed to further assess synchronization signal
reference signal received power, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, and
reference signal received quality. The results provide valuable guidance for
the design and optimization of 5G-R systems in HSR environments.

Abstract: Channel measurements are the prerequisite for applying emerging transmission
technologies and designing communication systems. In sixth-generation (6G)
system, conventional time or frequency domain channel sounding methods cannot
directly obtain Doppler information induced by high-mobility scenarios. The
channel spreading function (CSF) simultaneously captures delay and Doppler
information, while naturally characterizing the propagation environment in the
delay-Doppler (DD) domain. However, DD domain channel sounding methods remain
underexplored. This paper presents a novel DD domain channel sounding method
for 6G high-mobility scenarios. First, we introduce the waveform design for the
sounding signal and analyze its sounding capability. Next, the methodology of
DD domain channel sounding, including synchronization and CSF estimation, is
thoroughly detailed. Additionally, an algorithm for enhancing measurement
precision is proposed. The performance of the proposed method is rigorously
evaluated. Subsequently, a DD domain channel sounding system competent for 6G
high-mobility scenarios is established. Finally, DD domain channel measurements
are conducted for a vehicle-to-infrastructure scenario in urban environments.
Measurement results, including CSF, power delay profile, Doppler power spectral
density, number of multipath components, and other characteristics, are
derived, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and offer
helpful insights for advancing research on 6G high-mobility communications.

Abstract: This paper investigates security vulnerabilities and countermeasures for 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) Time
Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization
in low-altitude urban environments. We first optimize node selection strategies
under Air to Ground (A2G) channel conditions, proving that optimal selection
depends on UAV altitude and deployment density. We propose lightweight User
Equipment (UE)-assisted that reduce overhead while enhancing accuracy. We then
expose critical security vulnerabilities by introducing merged-peak spoofing
attacks where rogue UAVs transmit multiple lower-power pulses that merge with
legitimate signals, bypassing existing detection methods. Through theoretical
modeling and sensitivity analysis, we quantify how synchronization quality and
geometric factors determine spoofing success probability, revealing fundamental
weaknesses in current 3GPP positioning frameworks. To address these
vulnerabilities, we design a network-centric anomaly detection framework at the
Localization Management Function (LMF) using existing 3GPP-specified
parameters, coupled with a recursive gradient descent-based robust localization
algorithm that filters anomaly data while estimating UAV position. Our unified
framework simultaneously provides robust victim localization and spoofer
localization-capabilities not integrated in existing literature. Extensive
simulations validate the effectiveness of both optimization and security
mechanisms for 3GPP-compliant UAV positioning.

(AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveforms against passive
eavesdroppers performing brute-force demodulation to intercepted signals, under
the assumption that eavesdroppers have no knowledge of chirp parameters (in
AFDM) or the delay-Doppler grid configuration (in OTFS), such that they must
search exhaustively over possible demodulation matrices. Analytical results
show that the brute-force complexity scales as $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ for OTFS
and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ for AFDM, where $N$ is the number of subcarriers,
indicating that AFDM has superior resilience over OTFS. Bit error rate (BER)
simulations confirm the analysis by showing that, with AFDM, the signal remains
nearly undecodable at the eavesdropper, while OTFS allows partial signal
recovery under equivalent conditions.

*Sahar Maleki,Reza Lashgari,Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli,Mohammad Komareji*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出使用MLP神经网络作为新方法，比传统Naka-Rushton函数更好地拟合局部场电位对亮度对比度刺激的响应调谐曲线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 局部场电位（LFPs）是研究神经元群体活动的重要测量指标，但其响应调谐通常比尖峰调谐更弱更宽。选择合适的调谐方法对于准确评估LFP响应并与邻近的尖峰活动进行比较至关重要。

Method: 分析灵长类初级视觉皮层记录的亮度对比度诱发的LFP响应，使用单调性指数区分超饱和、线性和饱和对比度响应函数，然后通过MLP神经网络、RBF神经网络、模糊模型、神经模糊模型和LOLIMOT算法等静态识别方法识别超饱和记录数据。

Result: 与传统和改进的双曲Naka-Rushton函数相比，MLP神经网络在调谐局部场电位对亮度对比度刺激的响应方面表现出更优越的性能，成功调谐了所有三种类型的显著更多神经记录。

Conclusion: MLP神经网络模型可以作为测量神经元群体对比度敏感性调谐曲线的新方法，比其他当前使用的模型提供更好的拟合效果。

Abstract: Local field potentials (LFPs) have been demonstrated to be an important
measurement to study the activity of a local population of neurons. The
response tunings of LFPs have been mostly reported as weaker and broader than
spike tunings. Therefore, selecting optimized tuning methods is essential for
appropriately evaluating the LFP responses and comparing them with neighboring
spiking activity. In this paper, new models for tuning of the contrast response
functions (CRFs) are proposed. To this end, luminance contrast-evoked LFP
responses recorded in primate primary visual cortex (V1) are first analyzed.
Then, supersaturating CRFs are distinguished from linear and saturating CRFs by
using monotonicity index (MI). The supersaturated recording data are then
identified through static identification methods including multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural network,
fuzzy model, neuro-fuzzy model, and the local linear model tree (LOLIMOT)
algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the MLP neural network, compared to
traditional and modified hyperbolic Naka-Rushton functions, exhibits superior
performance in tuning the local field potential responses to luminance contrast
stimuli, resulting in successful tuning of a significantly higher number of
neural recordings of all three types. These results suggest that the MLP neural
network model can be used as a novel approach to measure a better fitted
contrast sensitivity tuning curve of a population of neurons than other
currently used models.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于微多普勒能量的77GHz FMCW雷达多目标生命体征监测框架，相比传统相位方法具有更强的抗噪和抗运动干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相位监测方法易受环境噪声、随机身体运动和严格校准要求影响，需要更鲁棒的生命体征监测技术。

Method: 集成STAP目标检测跟踪、MUSIC角度估计和自适应频谱滤波技术，建立微多普勒能量与生理活动的数学关系框架。

Result: 在5米范围内准确监测4个目标，呼吸和心率平均绝对误差分别为1.2和2.3次/分钟，性能优于传统相位方法。

Conclusion: 微多普勒能量方法在复杂多目标场景下具有显著优势，为鲁棒生命体征监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel micro-Doppler energy-based framework for robust
multi-target vital signs monitoring using 77-GHz Frequency-Modulated
Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Unlike conventional phase-based methods that are
susceptible to environmental noise, random body movements, and stringent
calibration requirements, our approach exploits the energy variations in radar
returns induced by cardiopulmonary activities. The proposed system integrates a
comprehensive processing pipeline including space-time adaptive processing
(STAP) for target detection and tracking, MUSIC algorithm for high-resolution
angle estimation, and an innovative adaptive spectral filtering technique for
vital signs extraction. We establish a rigorous mathematical framework that
formalizes the relationship between micro-Doppler energy variations and
physiological activities, enabling robust separation of closely spaced targets.
The key innovation lies in the micro-Doppler energy extraction methodology that
provides inherent robustness to phase noise and motion artifacts. Experimental
results using millimeter-wave radar datasets demonstrate that the system can
accurately detect and separate vital signs of up to four targets within
\SI{5}{\meter} range, achieving mean absolute errors of \SI{1.2}beats per
minute and \SI{2.3} beats per minute for respiration and heart rates,
respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared
to traditional phase-based methods, particularly in challenging multi-target
scenarios with environmental noise and subject movement.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究评估了ECG和ICG特征在生物识别中的表现，发现QRS相关的ECG特征在情绪变化下具有最强的区分能力和稳定性，而ICG特征提供补充但稳定性较差的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ECG和ICG特征在生物识别中的区分能力，特别关注它们对情绪变化的鲁棒性，以确定哪些特征最适合用于可靠的身份识别。

Method: 使用随机森林模型结合多种可解释性方法（Gini重要性、置换重要性、SHAP值）评估29个ECG和ICG特征，进行特征重要性分析、相关性分析和统计检验，并采用递归特征消除和遗传算法进行特征选择。

Result: ECG特征特别是QRS相关特征在重要性排名中始终位居前列，14个特征子集能达到与完整特征集相当的准确率（99%），同时提高了存储和计算效率。QRS相关特征对情绪变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可靠的生物识别主要依赖于QRS相关的ECG特征，这些特征在情绪变化下保持稳定，可能反映了心室质量、传导通路和胸腔几何的个体差异；ICG特征提供辅助但稳定性较差的信息。

Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance
cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their
discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29
features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological)
are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple
interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and
ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini
importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features,
particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In
parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower
cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial
multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across
highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions.
Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences
between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature
selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges
on a subset (14 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set
(99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. These complementary
analyses indicate that the individuality required for reliable identification
is primarily encoded in QRS-related ECG features across all four domains.
Meanwhile, BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude,
providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. The confirmed
resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation, where stable
inter-individual differences in the QRS complex could be traced to variations
in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry, may indicate
their central role in future models of cardiogram-based identity.

TL;DR: 提出了StutterZero和StutterFormer两种端到端波形到波形模型，能够直接将口吃语音转换为流畅语音并同时预测转录文本，在多个基准测试中显著降低了词错误率并提高了语义相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球有7000多万人经历口吃，但现有自动语音系统往往误解或无法准确转录不流畅的语音。现有方法依赖手工特征提取或多阶段ASR-TTS管道，导致失真放大。

Method: StutterZero采用卷积双向LSTM编码器-解码器加注意力机制，StutterFormer集成双流Transformer并共享声学-语言表示。两种架构都在合成的口吃-流畅配对数据上训练。

Result: StutterZero相比Whisper-Medium模型词错误率降低24%，语义相似度提高31%；StutterFormer表现更好，词错误率降低28%，语义相似度提高34%。

Conclusion: 验证了直接端到端口吃到流畅语音转换的可行性，为包容性人机交互、语音治疗和面向可访问性的AI系统提供了新机会。

Abstract: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic
speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them
accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature
extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech
(TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and
often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer,
the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert
stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription.
StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with
attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with
shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on
paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter
corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across
all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a
31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading
Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28%
decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the
feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering
new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and
accessibility-oriented AI systems.

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用cEEGrid耳部EEG系统进行听觉注意力解码，引入包含三个并发说话者的新数据集，采用嵌套留一验证方法评估四种基于规则的模型，发现Wiener滤波器和CCA模型能有效跟踪注意力状态切换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有cEEGrid听觉注意力解码研究往往忽略真实场景中注意力状态的动态特性，需要开发更生态有效的范式来研究注意力跟踪和切换。

Method: 引入包含三个说话者分布在五个空间位置的新cEEGrid数据集，采用嵌套留一验证方法，评估Wiener滤波器、CCA、CSP和Riemannian几何分类器四种模型。

Result: 30秒决策窗口下WF和CCA模型解码准确率分别为41.5%和41.4%，10秒窗口下CSP和RGC分别为37.8%和37.6%。WF和CCA能成功跟踪所有实验任务中的注意力状态切换，且上排电极和右耳附近电极解码准确率更高。

Conclusion: 动态生态有效范式和严格验证方法对推进cEEGrid听觉注意力解码研究具有重要价值，cEEGrid系统在跟踪注意力状态切换方面表现出实用性。

Abstract: Recent promising results in auditory attention decoding (AAD) using scalp
electroencephalography (EEG) have motivated the exploration of cEEGrid, a
flexible and portable ear-EEG system. While prior cEEGrid-based studies have
confirmed the feasibility of AAD, they often neglect the dynamic nature of
attentional states in real-world contexts. To address this gap, a novel cEEGrid
dataset featuring three concurrent speakers distributed across three of five
distinct spatial locations is introduced. The novel dataset is designed to
probe attentional tracking and switching in realistic scenarios. Nested
leave-one-out validation-an approach more rigorous than conventional
single-loop leave-one-out validation-is employed to reduce biases stemming from
EEG's intricate temporal dynamics. Four rule-based models are evaluated: Wiener
filter (WF), canonical component analysis (CCA), common spatial pattern (CSP)
and Riemannian Geometry-based classifier (RGC). With a 30-second decision
window, WF and CCA models achieve decoding accuracies of 41.5% and 41.4%,
respectively, while CSP and RGC models yield 37.8% and 37.6% accuracies using a
10-second window. Notably, both WF and CCA successfully track attentional state
switches across all experimental tasks. Additionally, higher decoding
accuracies are observed for electrodes positioned at the upper cEEGrid layout
and near the listener's right ear. These findings underscore the utility of
dynamic, ecologically valid paradigms and rigorous validation in advancing AAD
research with cEEGrid.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典听觉外周模型虽然保真度高，但具有随机性和计算量大，限制了大规模实验和低延迟应用。现有神经编码器很少专门训练来复现确定性速率域神经图谱。

Method: 使用紧凑的卷积编码器架构，省略随机尖峰效应，专注于确定性映射，实现音频到多频率神经图谱的转换。

Result: 编码器在保持与参考模型高度一致的同时，显著减少了计算量，实现了高效建模。

Conclusion: 该编码器为听觉神经科学和音频信号处理应用提供了高效的前端处理方案，支持大规模实验和低延迟使用。

Abstract: Classical auditory-periphery models, exemplified by Bruce et al., 2018,
provide high-fidelity simulations but are stochastic and computationally
demanding, limiting large-scale experimentation and low-latency use. Prior
neural encoders approximate aspects of the periphery; however, few are
explicitly trained to reproduce the deterministic, rate-domain neurogram ,
hindering like-for-like evaluation. We present a compact convolutional encoder
that approximates the Bruce mean-rate pathway and maps audio to a
multi-frequency neurogram. We deliberately omit stochastic spiking effects and
focus on a deterministic mapping (identical outputs for identical inputs).
Using a computationally efficient design, the encoder achieves close
correspondence to the reference while significantly reducing computation,
enabling efficient modeling and front-end processing for auditory neuroscience
and audio signal processing applications.

Result: 在现有数据集上训练的模型在重放音频上平均准确率降至59.6%，而在EchoFake上训练的模型在不同数据集上实现了更低的平均等错误率，表明更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EchoFake通过引入与真实世界部署相关的更实用挑战，为推进欺骗检测方法提供了更现实的基础。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of speech deepfakes has raised serious concerns,
particularly in real-world scenarios such as telephone fraud and identity
theft. While many anti-spoofing systems have demonstrated promising performance
on lab-generated synthetic speech, they often fail when confronted with
physical replay attacks-a common and low-cost form of attack used in practical
settings. Our experiments show that models trained on existing datasets exhibit
severe performance degradation, with average accuracy dropping to 59.6% when
evaluated on replayed audio. To bridge this gap, we present EchoFake, a
comprehensive dataset comprising more than 120 hours of audio from over 13,000
speakers, featuring both cutting-edge zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) speech and
physical replay recordings collected under varied devices and real-world
environmental settings. Additionally, we evaluate three baseline detection
models and show that models trained on EchoFake achieve lower average EERs
across datasets, indicating better generalization. By introducing more
practical challenges relevant to real-world deployment, EchoFake offers a more
realistic foundation for advancing spoofing detection methods.

Method: 使用协方差相减法估计选定独立声源的相对传递矩阵，并在混响条件下通过说话人分离应用验证方法。

Result: 在低信噪比条件下，与现有的相对传递矩阵和相对传递函数估计器相比，在模拟和真实环境中都表现出良好的分离性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为相对传递矩阵的估计提供了一种灵活实用的解决方案，在混响环境下的声源分离应用中具有良好性能。

Abstract: The Relative Transfer Matrix (ReTM), recently introduced as a generalization
of the relative transfer function for multiple receivers and sources, shows
promising performance when applied to speech enhancement and speaker separation
in noisy environments. Blindly estimating the ReTM of sound sources by
exploiting the covariance matrices of multichannel recordings is highly
beneficial for practical applications. In this paper, we use covariance
subtraction to present a flexible and practically viable method for estimating
the ReTM for a select set of independent sound sources. To show the versatility
of the method, we validated it through a speaker separation application under
reverberant conditions. Separation performance is evaluated at low
signal-to-noise ratio levels in comparison with existing ReTM-based and
relative transfer function-based estimators, in both simulated and real-life
environments.

Motivation: 改进EEND-VC框架的第二阶段，解决短片段中不可靠嵌入和说话人数量多、说话时长有限时的聚类鲁棒性问题。

Method: 第一阶段使用基于Conformer的EEND模型和WavLM特征推断短窗口内的说话人活动，第二阶段过滤不可靠嵌入并在聚类后重新分配，同时集成VBx聚类提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在跨多个领域的复合基准测试中，无需微调EEND模型或调整聚类参数，系统泛化良好，性能达到或超过最新技术水平。

Conclusion: 提出的改进方法有效提升了说话人日志系统的性能，特别是在处理不可靠嵌入和复杂说话人场景时表现出色。

Abstract: We present improvements to speaker diarization in the two-stage end-to-end
neural diarization with vector clustering (EEND-VC) framework. The first stage
employs a Conformer-based EEND model with WavLM features to infer frame-level
speaker activity within short windows. The identities and counts of global
speakers are then derived in the second stage by clustering speaker embeddings
across windows. The focus of this work is to improve the second stage; we
filter unreliable embeddings from short segments and reassign them after
clustering. We also integrate the VBx clustering to improve robustness when the
number of speakers is large and individual speaking durations are limited.
Evaluation on a compound benchmark spanning multiple domains is conducted
without fine-tuning the EEND model or tuning clustering parameters per dataset.
Despite this, the system generalizes well and matches or exceeds recent
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: AMAuT为大型预训练模型提供了高效灵活的替代方案，使最先进的音频分类在计算受限环境中变得可行。

Abstract: Recent foundational models, SSAST, EAT, HuBERT, Qwen-Audio, and Audio
Flamingo, achieve top-tier results across standard audio benchmarks but are
limited by fixed input rates and durations, hindering their reusability. This
paper introduces the Augmentation-driven Multiview Audio Transformer (AMAuT), a
training-from-scratch framework that eliminates the dependency on pre-trained
weights while supporting arbitrary sample rates and audio lengths. AMAuT
integrates four key components: (1) augmentation-driven multiview learning for
robustness, (2) a conv1 + conv7 + conv1 one-dimensional CNN bottleneck for
stable temporal encoding, (3) dual CLS + TAL tokens for bidirectional context
representation, and (4) test-time adaptation/augmentation (TTA^2) to improve
inference reliability. Experiments on five public benchmarks, AudioMNIST,
SpeechCommands V1 & V2, VocalSound, and CochlScene, show that AMAuT achieves
accuracies up to 99.8% while consuming less than 3% of the GPU hours required
by comparable pre-trained models. Thus, AMAuT presents a highly efficient and
flexible alternative to large pre-trained models, making state-of-the-art audio
classification accessible in computationally constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统频率分析和机器学习方法常忽略声音的细微特征，而拓扑数据分析能捕捉复杂模式，但在音色分析中应用有限，主要因为缺乏有效的声学表示方法。

Method: 使用合成和真实音频信号，研究不同时间延迟嵌入对TDA结果的影响，识别能增强谐波结构检测的时间延迟。

Result: 发现与基频周期分数相关的特定延迟能让TDA揭示关键谐波特征，有效区分整数和非整数谐波，适用于合成和真实乐器声音。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来研究开辟了道路，可通过高维嵌入和额外持久性统计扩展到更复杂的声音分析。

Abstract: Timbre allows us to distinguish between sounds even when they share the same
pitch and loudness, playing an important role in music, instrument recognition,
and speech. Traditional approaches, such as frequency analysis or machine
learning, often overlook subtle characteristics of sound. Topological Data
Analysis (TDA) can capture complex patterns, but its application to timbre has
been limited, partly because it is unclear how to represent sound effectively
for TDA. In this study, we investigate how different time delay embeddings
affect TDA results. Using both synthetic and real audio signals, we identify
time delays that enhance the detection of harmonic structures. Our findings
show that specific delays, related to fractions of the fundamental period,
allow TDA to reveal key harmonic features and distinguish between integer and
non-integer harmonics. The method is effective for synthetic and real musical
instrument sounds and opens the way for future works, which could extend it to
more complex sounds using higher-dimensional embeddings and additional
persistence statistics.

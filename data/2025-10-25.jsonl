Nevertheless, stability and fidelity remain key challenges,\nmanifesting as mispronunciations, audible noise, and quality degradation. To\naddress these issues, we introduce Vox-Evaluator, a multi-level evaluator\ndesigned to guide the correction of erroneous speech segments and preference\nalignment for TTS systems. It is capable of identifying the temporal boundaries\nof erroneous segments and providing a holistic quality assessment of the\ngenerated speech. Specifically, to refine erroneous segments and enhance the\nrobustness of the zero-shot TTS model, we propose to automatically identify\nacoustic errors with the evaluator, mask the erroneous segments, and finally\nregenerate speech conditioning on the correct portions. In addition, the\nfine-gained information obtained from Vox-Evaluator can guide the preference\nalignment for TTS model, thereby reducing the bad cases in speech synthesis.\nDue to the lack of suitable training datasets for the Vox-Evaluator, we also\nconstructed a synthesized text-speech dataset annotated with fine-grained\npronunciation errors or audio quality issues. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Vox-Evaluator in enhancing the\nstability and fidelity of TTS systems through the speech correction mechanism\nand preference optimization.

We propose a location deception (LD) scheme where scatterers\nare deliberately illuminated with probing power that is higher than that\ndirected toward targets of interest, with the goal of deceiving potential\neavesdroppers (Eves) with sensing capability into misidentifying scatterers as\ntargets. While the known scatterers can be removed at the legitimate sensing\nreceiver, our LD approach causes Eves to misdetect targets. Notably, this\ndeception is achieved without requiring any prior information about the Eves'\ncharacteristics or locations. To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among\ncommunication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and\npower allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate\nradar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the\nfractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to\nsolve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the\nCramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between\ntargets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD\nframework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical\nperspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can\nflexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements,\nthereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of\nsensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal\nstrength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the\nactual target."}

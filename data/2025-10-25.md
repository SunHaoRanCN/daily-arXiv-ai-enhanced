Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a crucial role in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) and neurological diagnostics, but its real-world deployment
faces challenges due to noise artifacts, missing data, and high annotation
costs. We introduce SSL-SE-EEG, a framework that integrates Self-Supervised
Learning (SSL) with Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SE-Nets) to enhance
feature extraction, improve noise robustness, and reduce reliance on labeled
data. Unlike conventional EEG processing techniques, SSL-SE-EEG} transforms EEG
signals into structured 2D image representations, suitable for deep learning.
Experimental validation on MindBigData, TUH-AB, SEED-IV and BCI-IV datasets
demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy (91% in MindBigData, 85% in TUH-AB),
making it well-suited for real-time BCI applications. By enabling low-power,
scalable EEG processing, SSL-SE-EEG presents a promising solution for
biomedical signal analysis, neural engineering, and next-generation BCIs.

Abstract: Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively
ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future
observations given past context. However, its direct computation for
high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable.
This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds
established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the
conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is
upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of
next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this
theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's
inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices.
  To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we
conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive
processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares
prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive
noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data
with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to
recover the known complexity ordering.
  This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series
complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models,
that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非侵入性脑机接口(EEG)信号质量差、空间分辨率低的问题，为运动或言语障碍患者提供安全、可扩展的通信恢复方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为非侵入性脑机接口提供了准确、低延迟、完全便携的实时通信解决方案。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a pathway to restore communication for
individuals with severe motor or speech impairments. Imagined handwriting
provides an intuitive paradigm for character-level neural decoding, bridging
the gap between human intention and digital communication. While invasive
approaches such as electrocorticography (ECoG) achieve high accuracy, their
surgical risks limit widespread adoption. Non-invasive electroencephalography
(EEG) offers safer and more scalable alternatives but suffers from low
signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, constraining its decoding
precision. This work demonstrates that advanced machine learning combined with
informative EEG feature extraction can overcome these barriers, enabling
real-time, high-accuracy neural decoding on portable edge devices. A 32-channel
EEG dataset was collected from fifteen participants performing imagined
handwriting. Signals were preprocessed with bandpass filtering and artifact
subspace reconstruction, followed by extraction of 85 time-, frequency-, and
graphical-domain features. A hybrid architecture, EEdGeNet, integrates a
Temporal Convolutional Network with a multilayer perceptron trained on the
extracted features. When deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2, the system achieved
89.83 percent accuracy with 914.18 ms per-character latency. Selecting only ten
key features reduced latency by 4.5 times to 202.6 ms with less than 1 percent
loss in accuracy. These results establish a pathway for accurate, low-latency,
and fully portable non-invasive BCIs supporting real-time communication.

Abstract: Accurate modulation classification is a core challenge in cognitive radio,
adaptive communications, spectrum analysis, and related domains, especially
under dynamic channels without transmitter knowledge. To address this need,
this article presents a labeled synthetic dataset designed for wireless
modulation classification under realistic propagation scenarios. The signals
were generated in MATLAB by modulating randomly generated bitstreams using five
digital modulation schemes: BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM. These
signals were then transmitted through Rayleigh and Rician fading channels with
standardized parameters, along with additional impairments to enhance realism
and diversity. Each modulated signal contains 1000 symbols. A comprehensive set
of features was extracted from the signals, encompassing statistical,
time-domain, frequency-domain, spectrogram-based, spectral correlation-based,
and image-processing-based descriptors such as BRISK, MSER, and GLCM. The
dataset is organized into 10 CSV files covering two channel types (Rayleigh and
Rician) across five sampling frequencies: 1 MHz, 10 MHz, 100 MHz, 500 MHz, and
1 GHz. To facilitate reproducibility and encourage further experimentation, the
MATLAB scripts used for signal generation and feature extraction are also
provided. This dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for developing and
evaluating machine learning models in modulation classification, signal
identification, and wireless communication research.

*Maximilian H. V. Tillmann,Avinash Kankari,Carsten Bockelmann,Armin Dekorsy*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一个多用户语义通信系统，同时支持任务执行和数据重建，通过互信息最大化来优化这两个目标的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义通信系统主要专注于任务执行或数据重建，缺乏同时支持这两个目标的解决方案，特别是在多用户场景下。

Method: 将任务执行和数据重建的目标表述为互信息最大化问题，使用联合目标函数作为两者的凸组合，并推导出SSIM损失与互信息最大化目标的关系。

Result: 在固定资源使用下，适当增加重建目标的权重可以在保持任务执行性能基本不变的同时，显著改善数据重建质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的语义通信系统能够有效平衡任务执行和数据重建两个目标，为多用户场景提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic communication has gained significant attention with the advances in
machine learning. Most semantic communication works focus on either task
execution or data reconstruction, with some recent works combining the two. In
this work, we propose a semantic communication system for concurrent task
execution and data reconstruction for a multi-user scenario, which we formulate
as the maximization of mutual information. To investigate the trade-off between
the two objectives, we formulate a joint objective as a convex combination of
task execution and data reconstruction. We show that under specific
assumptions, the \ac{SSIM} loss can be obtained from the mutual information
maximization objective for data reconstruction, which takes human visual
perception into account. Furthermore, for constant resource use, we show that
by increasing the weight of the reconstruction objective up to a certain point,
the task execution performance can be kept nearly constant, while the data
reconstruction can be significantly improved.

*Tawfik Osman,Aditya S. Shekhawat,Abhradeep Roy,Georgios C. Trichopoulos,Ahmed Alkhateeb*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文介绍了在O-RAN 5G系统中集成可重构智能表面(RIS)的设计、实现和评估，展示了RIS在毫米波频段显著提升信号覆盖和移动性管理的实际可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用RIS将电磁波重定向到期望方向，以增强信号覆盖和改善用户设备的信噪比，同时解决RIS辅助系统中用户移动性管理的挑战。

Method: 设计了1,024元件的1位RIS，采用模块化可扩展的瓦片架构；利用O-RAN E2接口动态控制RIS配置；开发了两种UE移动性管理算法，利用UE接收信号功率实时联合跟踪和调整RIS与UE波束。

Conclusion: 研究证实了将RIS集成到O-RAN系统中以增强下一代蜂窝网络覆盖、移动性支持和链路可靠性的实际可行性。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) can redirect electromagnetic waves
to desired directions to enhance signal coverage and/or improve signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at the user equipment (UE). We present the design, implementation,
and evaluation of an RIS-assisted O-RAN 5G system operating in the FR2
millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band. We first introduce the design of 1,024
element (32 $\times$ 32) 1-bit RIS operating at the 28 GHz band, utilizing a
modular and scalable tiled architecture. Then we demonstrate how the O-RAN E2
interface can be leveraged to dynamically control RIS configurations without
modifying standard 5G signaling procedures. To evaluate the RIS-assisted 5G
system, we conducted extensive field trials in both indoor and outdoor
environments. The results of the O-RAN link coverage trials show that the
deployed RIS provides substantial received signal power gains, ranging from 9
to 20 dB and 6 to 18 dB in indoor and outdoors scenarios, respectively.
Handling UE mobility in RIS-assisted systems is challenging due to the need for
joint RIS and UE beam management. For that, we develop two UE mobility
management algorithms and evaluate them in real-time operation using the RIS
O-RAN testbed. These algorithms leverage the received signal power at the UE to
jointly track and adapt the RIS and UE beams in real time as the UE moves. The
findings draw important insights into the practical feasibility of integrating
RIS into O-RAN systems to enhance coverage, mobility support, and link
reliability in next-generation cellular networks.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对OTFS双功能雷达通信系统的信号设计优化方法，通过联合优化导频符号设计和数据功率分配，显著提升了感知和通信性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了OTFS在双功能雷达通信系统中的信号设计优化，为充分利用OTFS潜力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) offers significant advantages in
managing mobility for both wireless sensing and communication systems, making
it a promising candidate for dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC).
However, the optimal signal design that fully exploits OTFS's potential in DFRC
has not been sufficiently explored. This paper addresses this gap by
formulating an optimization problem for signal design in DFRC-OTFS,
incorporating both pilot-symbol design for channel estimation and data-power
allocation. Specifically, we employ the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) of the
ambiguity function as a radar metric, accounting for the randomness of the data
symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. For communication, we derive
a channel capacity lower bound metric that considers channel estimation errors
in OTFS. We maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication metrics and
solve the optimization problem via an alternating optimization framework.
Simulations indicate that the proposed signal significantly improves the
sensing-communication performance region compared with conventional signal
schemes, achieving at least a 9.44 dB gain in ISL suppression for sensing, and
a 4.82 dB gain in the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for
communication.

Abstract: Underwater data infrastructures offer natural cooling and enhanced physical
security compared to terrestrial facilities, but are susceptible to acoustic
injection attacks that can disrupt data integrity and availability. This work
presents a comprehensive surveillance framework for localizing and tracking
close-range adversarial acoustic sources targeting offshore infrastructures,
particularly underwater data centers (UDCs). We propose a heterogeneous
receiver configuration comprising a fixed hydrophone mounted on the facility
and a mobile hydrophone deployed on a dedicated surveillance robot. While using
enough arrays of static hydrophones covering large infrastructures is not
feasible in practice, off-the-shelf approaches based on time difference of
arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) filtering fail to
generalize for this dynamic configuration. To address this, we formulate a
Locus-Conditioned Maximum A-Posteriori (LC-MAP) scheme to generate acoustically
informed and geometrically consistent priors, ensuring a physically plausible
initial state for a joint TDOA-FDOA filtering. We integrate this into an
unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) pipeline, which provides reliable convergence
under nonlinearity and measurement noise. Extensive Monte Carlo analyses,
Gazebo-based physics simulations, and field trials demonstrate that the
proposed framework can reliably estimate the 3D position and velocity of an
adversarial acoustic attack source in real time. It achieves sub-meter
localization accuracy and over 90% success rates, with convergence times nearly
halved compared to baseline methods. Overall, this study establishes a
geometry-aware, real-time approach for acoustic threat localization, advancing
autonomous surveillance capabilities of underwater infrastructures.

Conclusion: 所提出的位置欺骗方案能在无需窃听者先验信息的情况下有效提升感知安全性，实现通信、感知和安全性的灵活权衡。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore sensing security in near-field (NF) integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios by exploiting known scatterers in
the sensing scene. We propose a location deception (LD) scheme where scatterers
are deliberately illuminated with probing power that is higher than that
directed toward targets of interest, with the goal of deceiving potential
eavesdroppers (Eves) with sensing capability into misidentifying scatterers as
targets. While the known scatterers can be removed at the legitimate sensing
receiver, our LD approach causes Eves to misdetect targets. Notably, this
deception is achieved without requiring any prior information about the Eves'
characteristics or locations. To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among
communication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and
power allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate
radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the
fractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to
solve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the
Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed.
Additionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between
targets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD
framework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical
perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can
flexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements,
thereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of
sensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal
strength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the
actual target.

Abstract: The cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) is a promising
technology for the six generation (6G) communication systems. Channel
prediction will play an important role in obtaining the accurate CSI to improve
the performance of CF-mMIMO systems. This paper studies a deep learning (DL)
based joint space-time-frequency domain channel prediction for CF-mMIMO.
Firstly, the prediction problems are formulated, which can output the
multi-step prediction results in parallel without error propagation. Then, a
novel channel prediction model is proposed, which adds frequency convolution
(FreqConv) and space convolution (SpaceConv) layers to Transformer-encoder. It
is able to utilize the space-time-frequency correlations and extract the space
correlation in the irregular AP deployment. Next, simulated datasets with
different sizes of service areas, UE velocities and scenarios are generated,
and correlation analysis and cross-validation are used to determine the optimal
hyper-parameters. According to the optimized hyper-parameters, the prediction
accuracy and computational complexity are evaluated based on simulated
datasets. It is indicated that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is
higher than traditional model, and its computational complexity is lower than
traditional Transformer model. After that, the impacts of space-time-frequency
correlations on prediction accuracy are studied. Finally, realistic datasets in
a high-speed train (HST) long-term evolution (LTE) network are collected to
verify the prediction accuracy. The verification results demonstrate that it
also achieves higher prediction accuracy compared with traditional models in
the HST LTE network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络对高速数据传输的需求推动VLC作为射频系统的补充，但现有标准未充分利用光链路的特性，VLC链路的不对称性和方向性特点需要重新设计MAC层协议，NOMA技术有望解决这些问题。

Method: 通过文献综述方法，分析VLC链路特性、现有MAC协议的局限性，探讨NOMA在VLC中的应用场景、优化约束和目标，并指出未来研究方向。

Result: 研究发现VLC链路具有不对称性、方向性和带宽限制等特点，CSMA/CA等传统协议需要调整，NOMA技术能够允许多用户共享时频资源并控制干扰，在VLC中具有应用潜力。

Conclusion: VLC需要全新的MAC层设计，NOMA技术是6G VLC中一个有前景的方向，未来需要在优化约束、应用场景和实际部署等方面进行深入研究。

Abstract: Rapidly increasing demand for high speed data is pushing 6G wireless networks
to support larger link scales, lower latency, and higher spectral efficiency.
Visible light communications (VLC) is a strong complement to radio frequency
(RF) systems within 6G. The latest ITU G.9991 and IEEE 802.11bb standards are
adapted from cable and RF wireless technologies for use in VLC, so they do not
fully exploit the optical nature of light links. VLC links are often asymmetric
between uplink and downlink, which makes TDMA style protocols inefficient when
many users generate bursty and asymmetric traffic. Compared with RF, the strong
directionality and frequent line of sight in VLC can mitigate hidden and
exposed terminals, yet these effects can still appear under limited field of
view, blockage, or reflections. CSMA/CA and related methods remain usable in
VLC and in RF plus VLC networks, but they usually need design tweaks such as
RTS/CTS or directional sensing to perform well. Although the optical spectrum
is vast, the bandwidth of practical LEDs and of common PIN or APD receivers is
limited, so efficient multiple access can yield large gains. This motivates a
clean slate design for VLC, especially at the MAC layer. NOMA, first explored
in 5G RF systems, is also promising for 6G VLC. It lets multiple users share
the same time and frequency resources while tolerating controlled interference.
This paper reviews progress in VLC and in NOMA based VLC, outlines key
optimization constraints and objectives, surveys scenarios that fit NOMA in
VLC, and points to several directions for future work.

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a two-dimensional modulation
technique that uses the delay-Doppler (DD) domain and is a candidate for
providing robust, high-capacity wireless communications for envisioned 6G and
beyond networks. The OTFS technique maps data to the DD domain instead of the
traditional time-frequency domain, enabling it to fully utilize channel
diversity and transform fast time-varying channels into nearly static channels.
Index modulation (IM) is a communication paradigm that conveys information not
only through conventional modulation symbols but also by encoding data bits in
the indices of the selected communication resources to improve error
performance, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency. In this survey, a
comprehensive review of work on OTFS-based wireless communication systems is
presented. In particular, the existing OTFS-IM schemes are reviewed and
systematically categorized according to their system architectures, detection
methods, and performance aspects such as capacity, peak-to-average power ratio,
diversity, complexity, imperfect channel state information, spectral
efficiency, and outage probability. Furthermore, the operating principles and
system models of OTFS-IM variants-including OTFS-based space shift keying,
OTFS-based spatial modulation, OTFS-based quadrature spatial modulation,
OTFS-based media-based modulation, and OTFS-based code index modulation-are
described, followed by a comparative performance analysis in terms of
computational complexity, error performance, capacity, energy saving, spectral
efficiency, and throughput. Finally, the challenges, benefits, and future
directions for OTFS-IM systems are discussed, covering key aspects such as
complexity, efficiency, latency, channel estimation, hardware constraints,
synchronization, security, and potential integration with other advanced
wireless communication techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在近场XL-MIMO系统中，由于信道矩阵满列秩，现有的远场或单天线用户近场码本无法有效估计信道，需要新的解决方案

Method: 三阶段算法：1) 使用OMP和DFT字典进行子阵列信道估计；2) 利用MUSIC和LS准则估计用户阵列中心位置；3) 构建位置辅助字典矩阵，使用SBL进行MIMO信道估计

Result: 与多个基准方法相比，所提算法在导频开销和估计精度方面均表现出显著优势

Conclusion: 该三阶段算法有效解决了近场XL-MIMO系统中多天线用户的信道估计和3D定位问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of channel estimation and 3D localization
algorithms in a challenging scenario, where a sub-connected planar extremely
large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communicates with
multi-antenna users. In the near field, the uplink MIMO channel is of full
column rank and therefore can not be estimated effectively by applying existing
codebooks that are designed for the far-field case or for the near-field case
but limited to single antenna users. To solve this problem, we propose a
three-stage algorithm aided by orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and sparse
Bayesian learning (SBL). Specifically, we firstly partition the XL-MIMO into
subarrays and use OMP to solve the compressed sensing (CS) problem about
subarray channel estimation with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based
dictionary matrix. Secondly, exploiting the estimated subarray channels and
employing one-dimensional multiple signal classification (MUSIC), we estimate
the central location of the user array under the Least Squares (LS) criterion.
Finally, we utilize the estimated central location to construct a refined
location-aided dictionary matrix and obtain the MIMO channel estimation using
SBL. Results exhibit the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm
compared with several benchmarks, in terms of both the pilot overhead and
estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: 该研究为像素型RIS提供了有效的信道估计和波束成形解决方案，在保持低成本的同时实现了高性能。

Abstract: Pixel-based reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) employ a novel design
to achieve high reflection gain at a lower hardware cost by eliminating the
phase shifters used in traditional RIS. However, this design presents
challenges for channel estimation and passive beamforming due to its
non-separable state response, rendering existing solutions ineffective. To
address this, we first approximate the non-separable RIS response functions
using a kernel-based method and a deep neural network, achieving high accuracy
while reducing computational and memory complexity. Next, we propose a
simplified cascaded channel model that focuses on dominated scattering paths
with limited unknown parameters, along with customized algorithms to estimate
short-term and long-term parameters separately. Finally, we introduce a
low-complexity passive beamforming algorithm to configure the discrete RIS
state vector, maximizing the achievable rate. Our simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly outperforms various
baselines across a wide SNR range.

Abstract: We present AttDet, a Transformer-inspired MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple

inter-stream interference via a lightweight self-attention mechanism. Queries

interpretability with data-driven flexibility. We demonstrate through
link-level simulations under realistic 5G channel models and high-order, mixed
QAM modulation and coding schemes, that AttDet can approach near-optimal
BER/BLER (Bit Error Rate/Block Error Rate) performance while maintaining
predictable, polynomial complexity.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文比较了两种工业M2M网络MAC协议：BoP-MAC和FROG-MAC。BoP-MAC通过差异化退避值处理多优先级流量，而FROG-MAC通过分段低优先级流量实现高优先级数据早期传输。仿真显示FROG-MAC在延迟和吞吐量方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业M2M网络中需要低延迟可靠通信，多优先级数据的存在增加了挑战。过去十年开发了众多MAC方案，需要综合比较以了解各协议的相对优势和局限。

Method: 在Contiki平台上进行仿真，通过改变节点数量来比较BoP-MAC和FROG-MAC两种协议的性能。BoP-MAC采用差异化退避机制，FROG-MAC采用流量分段方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，在工业环境中处理多优先级异构数据时，FROG-MAC在延迟和吞吐量方面表现优于BoP-MAC。

Conclusion: 对于工业环境中的多优先级异构数据传输，FROG-MAC协议比BoP-MAC协议在延迟和吞吐量方面具有更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Efficient medium access control (MAC) is critical for enabling low-latency
and reliable communication in industrial Machine-to-Machine (M2M) net-works,
where timely data delivery is essential for seamless operation. The presence of
multi-priority data in high-risk industrial environments further adds to the
challenges. The development of tens of MAC schemes over the past decade often
makes it a tough choice to deploy the most efficient solu-tion. Therefore, a
comprehensive cross-comparison of major MAC protocols across a range of
performance parameters appears necessary to gain deeper insights into their
relative strengths and limitations. This paper presents a comparison of
Contention window-based MAC scheme BoP-MAC with a fragmentation based,
FROG-MAC; both protocols focus on reducing the delay for higher priority
traffic, while taking a diverse approach. BoP-MAC assigns a differentiated
back-off value to the multi-priority traffic, whereas FROG-MAC enables early
transmission of higher-priority packets by fragmenting lower-priority traffic.
Simulations were performed on Contiki by varying the number of nodes for two
traffic priorities. It has been shown that when work-ing with multi-priority
heterogenous data in the industrial environment, FROG-MAC results better both
in terms of delay and throughput.

Motivation: 探索在ISAC系统中，通过最大化判别增益而非传统的最小化均方误差，是否能获得更好的推理性能，特别是在低信噪比条件下实现更节能的传输。

Method: 采用压缩估计框架，将推理性能表征为判别增益的单调函数，推导了判别增益最优和均方误差最优的收发器闭式解，具有注水型结构和明确的感知通信权衡。

Conclusion: 判别增益最大化方法在ISAC系统中优于传统均方误差最小化，尤其在低信噪比条件下能实现更有效的功率分配和感知通信权衡。

Abstract: This work is concerned with the coordination gain in integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) systems under a compress-and-estimate (CE) framework,
wherein inference performance is leveraged as the key metric. To enable
tractable transceiver design and resource optimization, we characterize
inference performance via an error probability bound as a monotonic function of
the discriminant gain (DG). This raises the natural question of whether
maximizing DG, rather than minimizing mean squared error (MSE), can yield
better inference performance. Closed-form solutions for DG-optimal and
MSE-optimal transceiver designs are derived, revealing water-filling-type
structures and explicit sensing and communication (S\&C) tradeoff. Numerical
experiments confirm that DG-optimal design achieves more power-efficient
transmission, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, by
selectively allocating power to informative features and thus saving transmit
power for sensing.

Motivation: 当前DMA设计和模型通常是准窄带的，忽略了多功能的频率多样性表现及其利用，需要探索DMA在毫米波频段的频率多样性和色散操作。

Method: 通过动态全息可重构性操控DMA中超原子的色散，在操作频带内创建不同的辐射模式，实现灵活的频率多样性。

Result: 实现了增强的扫描范围和灵活的频率多样性，消除了对宽带系统或复杂移相网络的需求，为传统漏波天线的频率扫描静态波束提供了替代方案。

Conclusion: 结果为下一代近场和远场全息传感以及计算全息成像应用中DMA色散效应的建模和利用建立了基本见解。

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) represent a novel approach to
programmable and affordable electromagnetic wave manipulation for enhanced
wireless communications, sensing, and imaging applications. Nevertheless,
current DMA designs and models are usually quasi-narrowband, neglecting the
versatile frequency-diverse manifestation and its utilization. This work
demonstrates the frequency-diversity and dispersion operations of a
representative DMA structure at the millimeter-wave band. We demonstrate
flexible dispersion manipulation through dynamic holographic reconfigurability
of the meta-atoms in a DMA. This effect can create distinct radiation patterns
across the operating frequency band, achieving flexible frequency diversity
with enhanced scanning range within a compact, reconfigurable platform. It
eliminates the need for wideband systems or complex phase-shifting networks
while offering an alternative to frequency-scanned static beams of traditional
leaky-wave antennas. The results establish fundamental insights into modelling
and utilization of dispersive effects of DMAs in next-generation near-field and
far-field holographic sensing and computational holographic imaging
applications.

Motivation: 传统WMMSE算法由于矩阵求逆导致计算复杂度高（与基站天线数立方相关），难以应用于延迟敏感场景，需要开发更高效的计算方法。

Method: 采用块坐标梯度下降更新预编码矩阵，避免矩阵求逆仅使用矩阵乘法；引入基于和均方误差最小化问题的两阶段热启动策略加速收敛。

Result: 仿真结果表明A-MMMSE在加权和速率性能上与传统WMMSE及其增强变体reduced-WMMSE相当，但在各种系统配置下计算时间显著减少。

Conclusion: A-MMMSE算法通过避免矩阵求逆和利用GPU并行性，在保持性能的同时大幅提升计算效率，适用于延迟敏感的多用户MIMO系统。

Abstract: Precoding design based on weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization is a
fundamental problem in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) systems. While the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)
algorithm is a standard solution, its high computational complexity--cubic in
the number of base station antennas due to matrix inversions--hinders its
application in latency-sensitive scenarios. To address this limitation, we
propose a highly parallel algorithm based on a block coordinate descent
framework. Our key innovation lies in updating the precoding matrix via block
coordinate gradient descent, which avoids matrix inversions and relies solely
on matrix multiplications, making it exceptionally amenable to GPU
acceleration. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary
point of the WSR maximization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage
warm-start strategy grounded in the sum mean-square error (MSE) minimization
problem to accelerate convergence. We refer to our method as the Accelerated
Mixed weighted-unweighted sum-MSE minimization (A-MMMSE) algorithm. Simulation
results demonstrate that A-MMMSE matches the WSR performance of both
conventional WMMSE and its enhanced variant, reduced-WMMSE, while achieving a
substantial reduction in computational time across diverse system
configurations.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks have shown strategic superiority in
maritime communications, assisting in establishing signal transmissions from
shore to ship through space-based links. Traditional performance modeling based
on multiple circular orbits is challenging to characterize large-scale LEO
satellite constellations, thus requiring a tractable approach to accurately
evaluate the network performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical
framework for an LEO satellite-aided shore-to-ship communication network
(LEO-SSCN), where LEO satellites are distributed as a binomial point process
(BPP) on a specific spherical surface. The framework aims to obtain the
end-to-end transmission performance by considering signal transmissions through
either a marine link or a space link subject to Rician or Shadowed Rician
fading, respectively. Due to the indeterminate position of the serving
satellite, accurately modeling the distance from the serving satellite to the
destination ship becomes intractable. To address this issue, we propose a
distance approximation approach. Then, by approximation and incorporating a
threshold-based communication scheme, we leverage stochastic geometry to derive
analytical expressions of end-to-end transmission success probability and
average transmission rate capacity. Extensive numerical results verify the
accuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the effect of key parameters on the
performance of LEO-SSCN.

Conclusion: 所提出的UNDF方法有效实现了基于用户自定义指向性模式的空间滤波，在泛化性和性能方面优于传统方法

Abstract: Spatial filtering with a desired directivity pattern is advantageous for many
audio applications. In this work, we propose neural directional filtering with
user-defined directivity patterns (UNDF), which enables spatial filtering based
on directivity patterns that users can define during inference. To achieve
this, we propose a DNN architecture that integrates feature-wise linear
modulation (FiLM), allowing user-defined patterns to serve as conditioning
inputs. Through analysis, we demonstrate that the FiLM-based architecture
enables the UNDF to generalize to unseen user-defined patterns during
interference with higher directivities, scaling variations, and different
steering directions. Furthermore, we progressively refine training strategies
to enhance pattern approximation and enable UNDF to approximate irregular
shapes. Lastly, experimental comparisons show that UNDF outperforms
conventional methods.

Conclusion: Vox-Evaluator通过错误修正和偏好对齐机制，能够有效提升零样本文本到语音系统的稳定性和保真度，解决了当前TTS系统中的发音错误和质量下降问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), driven by language models,
diffusion models and masked generation, have achieved impressive naturalness in
speech synthesis. Nevertheless, stability and fidelity remain key challenges,
manifesting as mispronunciations, audible noise, and quality degradation. To
address these issues, we introduce Vox-Evaluator, a multi-level evaluator
designed to guide the correction of erroneous speech segments and preference
alignment for TTS systems. It is capable of identifying the temporal boundaries
of erroneous segments and providing a holistic quality assessment of the
generated speech. Specifically, to refine erroneous segments and enhance the
robustness of the zero-shot TTS model, we propose to automatically identify
acoustic errors with the evaluator, mask the erroneous segments, and finally
regenerate speech conditioning on the correct portions. In addition, the
fine-gained information obtained from Vox-Evaluator can guide the preference
alignment for TTS model, thereby reducing the bad cases in speech synthesis.
Due to the lack of suitable training datasets for the Vox-Evaluator, we also
constructed a synthesized text-speech dataset annotated with fine-grained
pronunciation errors or audio quality issues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Vox-Evaluator in enhancing the
stability and fidelity of TTS systems through the speech correction mechanism
and preference optimization. The demos are shown.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，UniSE与判别性和生成性基线模型相比，能够达到竞争性的性能表现。

Conclusion: 语言模型具有统一语音增强任务的能力，为多任务学习提供了兼容性。

Abstract: The development of neural audio codecs (NACs) has largely promoted
applications of language models (LMs) to speech processing and understanding.
However, there lacks the verification on the effectiveness of autoregressive
(AR) LMbased models in unifying different sub-tasks of speech enhancement (SE).
In this work, we propose UniSE, a unified decoder-only LM-based framework to
handle different SE tasks including speech restoration, target speaker
extraction and speech separation. It takes input speech features as conditions
and generates discrete tokens of the target speech using AR modeling, which
facilitates a compatibility between distinct learning patterns of multiple
tasks. Experiments on several benchmarks indicate the proposed UniSE can
achieve competitive performance compared to discriminative and generative
baselines, showing the capacity of LMs in unifying SE tasks. The demo page is

Conclusion: 语义优先的方法在语音编解码中有效，通过简化语义能力强的模型可以平衡语义和声学质量。

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between continuous speech signals and large
language models, yet face an inherent conflict between acoustic fidelity and
semantic preservation. To mitigate this conflict, prevailing methods augment
acoustic codecs with complex semantic supervision. We explore the opposite
direction: a semantic-first approach that starts from a semantically-capable
model and adapts it for high-fidelity acoustic reconstruction. Through
empirical analysis, we discover that targeted architectural simplification can
unlock the acoustic modeling potential of Whisper, a text-aligned Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) model. Based on this finding, we propose
SimWhisper-Codec, a novel codec that balances the semantic and acoustic
preservation by leveraging a frozen, simplified Whisper encoder without
requiring external supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that
SimWhisper-Codec achieves superior performance in both semantic preservation
and acoustic quality compared to semantically-supervised codecs such as Mimi
Codec and SpeechTokenizer at similar bitrates, validating the effectiveness of
our semantic-first approach. Code is available at

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DeEAR是一个评估语音表达性的框架，通过将人类对语音表达性的偏好转化为客观分数，解决了现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音到语音模型生成的语音虽然可理解，但缺乏自然的表达性，主要原因是缺乏可靠的评估指标。现有的主观MOS评分、低层声学特征和情感识别方法成本高、有限或不完整。

Method: DeEAR基于语音学和心理学，从情感、韵律和自发性三个维度评估语音表达性，使用少于500个标注样本就能实现与人类感知的强相关性（SRCC=0.86）。

Result: DeEAR不仅能够可靠地评分，还能实现公平基准测试和针对性数据筛选。它识别了不同S2S模型之间的表达性差距，并筛选了14K个表达性话语形成ExpressiveSpeech数据集，将S2S模型的表达性分数从2.0提升到23.4（100分制）。

Conclusion: DeEAR提供了一个有效的语音表达性评估框架，能够显著提升语音到语音模型的表达性质量。

Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still
lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable
evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings,
low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or
incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive
Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech
expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology,
DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and
Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples.
Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data
curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but
also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves
the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models.

Abstract: Achieving immersive auditory experiences in virtual environments requires
flexible sound modeling that supports dynamic source positions. In this paper,
we introduce a task called resounding, which aims to estimate room impulse
responses at arbitrary emitter location from a sparse set of measured emitter
positions, analogous to the relighting problem in vision. We leverage the
reciprocity property and introduce Versa, a physics-inspired approach to
facilitating acoustic field learning. Our method creates physically valid
samples with dense virtual emitter positions by exchanging emitter and listener
poses. We also identify challenges in deploying reciprocity due to
emitter/listener gain patterns and propose a self-supervised learning approach
to address them. Results show that Versa substantially improve the performance
of acoustic field learning on both simulated and real-world datasets across
different metrics. Perceptual user studies show that Versa can greatly improve
the immersive spatial sound experience. Code, dataset and demo videos are

Abstract: In real-world singing voice conversion (SVC) applications, environmental
noise and the demand for expressive output pose significant challenges.
Conventional methods, however, are typically designed without accounting for
real deployment scenarios, as both training and inference usually rely on clean
data. This mismatch hinders practical use, given the inevitable presence of
diverse noise sources and artifacts from music separation. To tackle these
issues, we propose R2-SVC, a robust and expressive SVC framework. First, we
introduce simulation-based robustness enhancement through random fundamental
frequency ($F_0$) perturbations and music separation artifact simulations
(e.g., reverberation, echo), substantially improving performance under noisy
conditions. Second, we enrich speaker representation using domain-specific
singing data: alongside clean vocals, we incorporate DNSMOS-filtered separated
vocals and public singing corpora, enabling the model to preserve speaker
timbre while capturing singing style nuances. Third, we integrate the Neural
Source-Filter (NSF) model to explicitly represent harmonic and noise
components, enhancing the naturalness and controllability of converted singing.
R2-SVC achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple SVC benchmarks under both
clean and noisy conditions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于情绪引导音乐嵌入转换的新框架，通过轻量级翻译模型实现可控的音乐检索，能够在改变音乐情绪的同时保持其他音乐属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音乐嵌入表示缺乏对单一音乐属性（如情绪）的精确控制能力，无法在改变特定维度（如情绪）的同时保持其他属性（如流派、乐器）不变。

Method: 使用基于采样的机制获取代理目标，训练轻量级翻译模型，并引入联合目标函数来平衡转换和信息保留。

Result: 在两个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在情绪转换方面表现强劲，同时在保持流派和乐器方面远优于无训练基线方法。

Conclusion: 可控嵌入转换是个性化音乐检索的一个有前景的范式。

Abstract: Music representations are the backbone of modern recommendation systems,
powering playlist generation, similarity search, and personalized discovery.
Yet most embeddings offer little control for adjusting a single musical
attribute, e.g., changing only the mood of a track while preserving its genre
or instrumentation. In this work, we address the problem of controllable music
retrieval through embedding-based transformation, where the objective is to
retrieve songs that remain similar to a seed track but are modified along one
chosen dimension. We propose a novel framework for mood-guided music embedding
transformation, which learns a mapping from a seed audio embedding to a target
embedding guided by mood labels, while preserving other musical attributes.
Because mood cannot be directly altered in the seed audio, we introduce a
sampling mechanism that retrieves proxy targets to balance diversity with
similarity to the seed. We train a lightweight translation model using this
sampling strategy and introduce a novel joint objective that encourages
transformation and information preservation. Extensive experiments on two
datasets show strong mood transformation performance while retaining genre and
instrumentation far better than training-free baselines, establishing
controllable embedding transformation as a promising paradigm for personalized
music retrieval.

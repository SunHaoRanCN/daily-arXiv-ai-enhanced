### [1] [Nonlinear Stacked Intelligent Surfaces for Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23780)
*Omran Abbas,Abdullah Zayat,Loıc Markley,Anas Chaaban*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了非线性堆叠智能表面(SIS)的概念，能够模拟神经网络行为，相比传统线性SIS在MIMO系统中显著降低了符号错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SIS只能进行线性操作，限制了其应用潜力。为了解锁SIS的更多可能性，需要开发能够执行非线性操作的SIS。

Method: 设计具有阶跃响应的非线性SIS单元，在MIMO系统中部署发射端和接收端SIS，仅使用统计信道信息来优化SIS结构以最小化符号错误率。

Result: 非线性SIS相比线性SIS能够提高通信可靠性，通过在SIS表面形成复杂信号模式来提供更高的抗噪声干扰多样性，同时仍允许接收器识别这些模式。

Conclusion: 非线性SIS是下一代无线系统的有前景技术，能够显著提升通信性能，并具有多种无线通信应用潜力。

Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS) are a promising technology for
next-generation wireless systems, offering an opportunity to enhance
communication performance with low power consumption. Typically, an SIS is
modelled as a surface that imparts phase shifts on impinging electromagnetic
signals to achieve desired communication objectives. However, this mode of
operation results in a linear SIS, which limits its applicability to linear
operations. To unlock further SIS potential, we propose a nonlinear SIS that
can mimic the behaviour of nonlinear neural networks. We discuss the
feasibility and potential of this idea and propose a nonlinear SIS unit cell
with a step-like response. To evaluate the system-level performance of
nonlinear SIS, we present a case study where SIS structures are optimized to
minimize the symbol error rate (SER) in an MIMO system with SIS deployed at
both the transmitter and receiver sides using only statistical channel
information. We demonstrate that a nonlinear SIS can improve communication
reliability compared to a linear SIS by forming complex signal patterns across
the SIS surface, which provide higher diversity against noise disturbances,
while still allowing the receiver to discern these patterns. Finally, we
outline several potential applications of nonlinear SIS in wireless
communication scenarios.

### [2] [Communication in a Fractional World: MIMO MC-OTFS Precoder Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23832)
*Evan Allen,Karim Said,Robert Calderbank,Lingjia Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于OTFS调制的物理信息复杂指数基扩展模型预测框架，用于解决高移动性MIMO通信中CSI反馈的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G高移动性场景（如VANETs和FANETs）中，传统时频CSI反馈方案在快速变化的信道条件下负担过重，需要转向更稳定的延迟-多普勒表示方法。

Method: 推导了OTFS输入输出关系随时间变化的表达式，并基于此创建了物理信息复杂指数基扩展模型预测框架，充分利用过时的CSI信息。

Result: 该框架能够处理整数和分数延迟-多普勒信道，支持高移动性MIMO通信。

Conclusion: OTFS调制结合物理信息预测框架为高移动性环境下的MIMO通信提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As 6G technologies advance, international bodies and regulatory agencies are
intensifying efforts to extend seamless connectivity especially for
high-mobility scenarios such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{MANETs}) types
such as Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{VANETs}) and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks
(\textit{FANETs}). For these environments to be considered for long term
adoption and use they must support Multiple-Input-Multiple- (MIMO) technology,
rapidly fluctuating channel conditions in these environments place a heavy
burden on traditional time-frequency CSI feedback schemes required for MIMO
precoding. This motivates a shift toward delay-Doppler representations like
those employed by Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space(OTFS) modulation, which
offers greater stability under mobility. We derive an expression for the
variation over time in the OTFS I/O relationship. We then use this to create a
physics informed complex exponential basis expansion model prediction framework
that maximizes the usefulness of outdated Channel State Information (CSI) in
the presence of integer and fractional delay-Doppler channels and facilitates
high mobility MIMO communication.

### [3] [Coordinated Multipoint Transmission in Pinching Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23837)
*Ali Amhaz,Shreya Khisa,Mohamed Elhattab,Chadi Assi,Sanaa Sharafeddine*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了采用捏合天线系统的CoMP传输，通过梯度元学习策略联合优化波束成形向量和捏合位置，以最大化可实现的系统和速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CoMP系统使用均匀线性阵列时存在速率上限限制，而捏合天线技术能够克服MIMO系统中的大规模衰落问题，因此研究其在CoMP系统中的应用具有重要意义。

Method: 采用梯度元学习策略来解决联合优化传输波束成形向量和波导上捏合位置的非凸优化问题，该问题由于决策参数间的强耦合而难以用传统优化方法解决。

Result: 数值分析表明，所提出的GML方法能达到最优解的92%，相比其他基准方法具有优越性，并且相比传统CoMP系统实现了更高的可达到速率上限。

Conclusion: 基于捏合天线系统的CoMP传输结合梯度元学习优化策略，能够有效提升系统性能，克服传统系统的速率限制，为未来无线通信系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: We study a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission where two base
stations (BSs), each supported by a pinching antenna system (PASS), are
deployed to jointly serve communication users under spatial division multiple
access (SDMA) technology. Pinching Antenna technology was introduced as a
promising solution to overcome the large-scale fading that has been shown to be
an impediment in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To realize the
advantages of this technology in CoMP systems, which suffer from an upperbound
rate limitation when traditional uniform linear arrays (ULAs) are adopted, we
formulate an optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the achievable sum
rate by jointly determining the transmit beamforming vectors and pinching
locations on the waveguides while respecting the quality of service (QoS)
requirements of users. This problem is inherently non-convex due to the strong
coupling among its decision parameters, making it challenging to solve using
traditional optimization methods. Thus, we utilize a gradient-based
meta-learning (GML) strategy specifically designed for large-scale optimization
tasks. Finally, numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed GML approach, achieving 92 percent of the optimal solution, and the
superiority of the solution presented compared to other benchmarks. In
addition, it achieves a higher upper bound on the achievable rate compared to
conventional CoMP systems.

### [4] [Accurate Prediction of Nonlinear Distortion of Multi-Carrier Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23844)
*Cameron M. Pike,Brad Oney,Gabriel Hepner,Animesh Yadav*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 使用特征函数级数方法预测稀疏多载波传输中的非线性失真频谱，该方法计算效率高，通过理论和实验验证了其准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 功率放大器中的非线性会严重影响多载波调制技术，需要准确预测非线性失真以在设计输出功率和网络吞吐量之间进行权衡。

Method: 采用特征函数级数方法，将非线性表示为前向散射参数或跨导函数的快速傅里叶变换，失真贡献表示为干净频谱的数值自卷积。

Result: 理论验证表明该方法与经典的Price定理结果一致；实验验证显示预测输出频谱与实验室测量结果相符，能够轻松计算信噪比。

Conclusion: 特征函数级数方法为预测非线性失真提供了一种计算效率高的有效工具，特别适用于难以应用Price定理的情况。

Abstract: Nonlinearities in power amplifiers adversely affect multi-carrier modulation
techniques. Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making
design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the
series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion
spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in
efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The
method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation
is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard
limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are
identical with the classical Price's theorem. Practical validation is shown by
considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a
fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into
compression for which application of Price's theorem is difficult, and the
predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the
computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed
as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering
parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects),
and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical
autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be
easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as
overdrive level.

### [5] [Learning-based Spectral Regression for Cocoa Bean Physicochemical Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23892)
*Kebin Contreras,Emmanuel Martinez,Brayan Monroy,Sebastian Ardila,Cristian Ramirez,Mariana Caicedo,Hans Garcia,Tatiana Gelvez-Barrera,Juan Poveda-Jaramillo,Henry Arguello,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于VIS-NIR光谱和机器学习回归模型的可扩展方法，用于非破坏性地评估可可豆的物理化学性质，替代传统耗时且破坏性的实验室分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可可豆质量评估方法耗时、破坏性且难以扩展，需要快速、可靠、非侵入性的替代方案。光谱技术提供了一种非侵入性替代方案，通过捕捉与这些性质相关的分子特征。

Method: 使用集成VIS-NIR光谱仪的传送带系统，结合基于学习的回归模型，从可可豆的光谱特征预测关键物理化学性质。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法代表了在可可生产链中质量评估的合适且可扩展的替代方案，可替代传统的实验室方法。

Abstract: Cocoa bean quality assessment is essential for ensuring compliance with
commercial standards, protecting consumer health, and increasing the market
value of the cocoa product. The quality assessment estimates key
physicochemical properties, such as fermentation level, moisture content,
polyphenol concentration, and cadmium content, among others. This assessment
has traditionally relied on the accurate estimation of these properties via
visual or sensory evaluation, jointly with laboratory-based physicochemical
analyses, which are often time-consuming, destructive, and difficult to scale.
This creates the need for rapid, reliable, and noninvasive alternatives.
Spectroscopy, particularly in the visible and near-infrared ranges, offers a
non-invasive alternative by capturing the molecular signatures associated with
these properties. Therefore, this work introduces a scalable methodology for
evaluating the quality of cocoa beans by predicting key physicochemical
properties from the spectral signatures of cocoa beans. This approach utilizes
a conveyor belt system integrated with a VIS-NIR spectrometer, coupled with
learning-based regression models. Furthermore, a dataset is built using cocoa
bean batches from Santander, Colombia. Ground-truth reference values were
obtained through standardized laboratory analyses and following commercial
cocoa quality regulations. To further evaluate the proposed methodology's
generalization, performance is tested on samples collected from other Colombian
regions and from Cusco, Peru. Experimental results show that the proposed
models achieved R2 scores exceeding 0.98 across all physicochemical properties,
and reached 0.96 accuracy on geographically independent samples. This
non-destructive approach represents a suitable and scalable alternative to
conventional laboratory methods for quality assessment across the cocoa
production chain.

Conclusion: 该推导方法为LEO通信系统提供了更准确的信道建模工具，有助于理解传播几何参数对信道特性的影响。

Abstract: This paper presents a new derivation of LEO-to-ground receiver channel model
to address a clear gap in the prior art: the lack of an appropriate geometry
aware characterization of non LOS (NLOS) link model represented by the power
spectral density (PSD). Specifically, the main contribution is a coherent
derivation of the PSD from 1st principles that is able to reproduce results in
prior art and explain the causal relationship of main PSD features to the
propagation geometry parameters.

### [7] [Inferring Group Intent as a Cooperative Game. An NLP-based Framework for Trajectory Analysis using Graph Transformer Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23905)

Conclusion: 该框架为群体目标轨迹意图的建模和推断提供了有效的多层级方法，结合了贝叶斯信号处理和神经网络技术，在群体行为分析方面具有应用价值。

Abstract: This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a
cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an
NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by
the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players
in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or
the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that
govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect
the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the
intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic
function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy
observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a
Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which
yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal
patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based
generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic
multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph
Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as
the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data
with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the
track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer
approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN
(for group intent inference).

### [8] [Machine Learning-Driven User Localization in RIS-Assisted Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23908)
*M. T. Hassan,D. Zelenchuk,M. A. B. Abbasi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的用户定位框架，用于RIS辅助的6G通信，通过测量四个角扇区的接收信号功率来实时预测用户角度位置，显著减少波束探测开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G需要毫米波频段的超可靠低延迟通信，但RIS扩展了波束搜索空间，传统穷举扫描方法效率低下且延迟高。

Method: 使用20x20 RIS在0-90度仰角平面扫描四个角扇区，记录接收信号功率构建数据集，训练多种回归模型（决策树、SVR、KNN、XGBoost等）进行用户角度位置预测。

Result: 决策树模型表现最佳，MAE为4.8度，R²=0.96；其他模型准确率在70-86%之间；预测辐射模式与真实值高度匹配。

Conclusion: 该框架减少波束探测，实现更快对准，降低RIS辅助6G网络的延迟。

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) targets ultra reliable, low latency (URLLC) gigabit
connectivity in mmWave bands, where directional channels require precise beam
alignment. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) reshape wave propagation
and extend coverage, but they enlarge the beam search space at the base
station, making exhaustive sweeps inefficient due to control overhead and
latency. We propose an ML based user localization framework for RIS assisted
communication at 27 GHz. A 20x20 RIS reflects signals from a core network
connected base station and sweeps beams across the 0-90 degree elevation plane,
divided into four angular sectors. We build a dataset by recording received
signal power (Pr in dBm) across user locations and train multiple regressors,
including decision tree (DT), support vector regressor (SVR), k nearest
neighbor (KNN), XGBoost, gradient boosting, and random forest. In operation, an
unknown user in the same plane measures four received power values (one per
sector) and reports them to the pretrained RIS controller, which predicts the
user's angular position in real time. Evaluation using mean absolute error
(MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R squared (R2) shows high accuracy.
The DT model achieves an MAE of 4.8 degrees with R2 = 0.96, while other models
reach 70 to 86 percent. Predicted radiation patterns, including main lobe
alignment between 52 and 55 degrees, closely track ground truth. The framework
reduces beam probing, enables faster alignment, and lowers latency for RIS
assisted 6G networks.

### [9] [Localized Acoustic-Event Measurement Probe: Connector Confirmation Utilizing Acoustic Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24017)
*Brian Skoglind,Travis Roberts,Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron Turner,Laine Mears*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于声学检测的电气连接状态验证系统，通过物理降噪和声音特征放大算法提高信噪比，在不改变现有手动连接过程的情况下，有效检测电气连接状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电子产品中大量的电气连接仍需要手动完成，容易因连接力不均或人为疲劳导致连接不良。现有视觉验证、增强现实或电路参数检测方法在检测连接状态方面能力有限。虽然大多数连接在成功配合时会发出特定声音，但基于声学的验证系统尚未得到充分研究，主要挑战是工厂环境中连接声音与背景噪声的低信噪比问题。

Method: 采用物理系统进行背景噪声抑制，并开发了成功配合噪声特征放大算法，提高电气连接配合声音与工厂声音环境之间的信噪比。

Result: 该解决方案在检测和分类连接状态方面的有效性超过75%，且无需对现有手动互连过程进行任何修改。

Conclusion: 声学检测方法可以有效验证电气连接状态，通过噪声抑制和特征放大技术能够克服工厂环境中低信噪比的挑战，为自动化装配线提供了一种可行的连接状态检测方案。

Abstract: Modern consumer products are full of interconnected electrical and electronic
modules to fulfill direct and indirect needs. In an automated assembly line
still, most of these interconnections are required to be done manually due to
the large variety of connector types, connector positions, and the soft,
flexible nature of their structures. The manual connection points are the
source of partial or completely loose connections. Sometimes connections are
missed due to the application of unequal mating forces and natural human
fatigue. Subsequently, these defects can lead to unexpected downtime and
expensive rework. For successful connection detection, past approaches such as
vision verification, Augmented Reality, or circuit parameter-based measurements
have shown limited ability to detect the correct connection state. Though most
connections emit a specific noise for successful mating, the acoustic-based
verification system for electrical connection confirmation has not been
extensively researched. The main discouraging reason for such research is the
typically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the sound of a pair of
electrical connector mating and the diverse soundscape of the plant. In this
study, the authors investigated increasing the SNR between the electrical
connector mating sound and the plant soundscape to improve connection success
detection by employing a physical system for background noise mitigation and
the successful met noise signature amplification algorithm. The solution is
over 75% effective at detecting and classifying connection state. The solution
has been constructed without any modification to the existing manual
interconnection process.

### [10] [PULSE: Privileged Knowledge Transfer from Electrodermal Activity to Low-Cost Sensors for Stress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24058)
*Zihan Zhao,Masood Mortazavi,Ning Yan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: PULSE框架利用EDA信号进行自监督预训练，但在推理阶段仅使用更易获取的ECG、BVP、ACC和TEMP信号，通过知识迁移将EDA的应激检测能力转移到低成本传感器上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EDA信号虽然是应激检测的主要信号，但需要昂贵的硬件设备，在现实可穿戴设备中往往不可用。

Method: 将编码器输出分为共享和私有嵌入，对齐跨模态的共享嵌入并融合为模态不变表示，私有嵌入携带模态特定信息支持重建目标。预训练后进行知识迁移，冻结的EDA教师模型将交感神经兴奋表示转移到学生编码器。

Result: 在WESAD数据集上，该方法实现了强大的应激检测性能。

Conclusion: 证明了特权EDA信号的表示可以转移到低成本传感器上，在降低硬件成本的同时提高准确性。

Abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA), the primary signal for stress detection,
requires costly hardware often unavailable in real-world wearables. In this
paper, we propose PULSE, a framework that utilizes EDA exclusively during
self-supervised pretraining, while enabling inference without EDA but with more
readily available modalities such as ECG, BVP, ACC, and TEMP. Our approach
separates encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings. We align shared
embeddings across modalities and fuse them into a modality-invariant
representation. The private embeddings carry modality-specific information to
support the reconstruction objective. Pretraining is followed by knowledge
transfer where a frozen EDA teacher transfers sympathetic-arousal
representations into student encoders. On WESAD, our method achieves strong
stress-detection performance, showing that representations of privileged EDA
can be transferred to low-cost sensors to improve accuracy while reducing
hardware cost.

Conclusion: 子带全双工无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统是通信感知一体化系统的可行方案，能够同时支持高质量的上行通信和精确的目标参数估计。

Abstract: In-band Full-duplex joint communication and sensing systems require self
interference cancellation as well as decoupling of the mutual interference
between UL communication signals and radar echoes. We present sub-band
full-duplex as an alternative duplexing scheme to achieve simultaneous uplink
communication and target parameter estimation in a cell-free massive MIMO
system. Sub-band full-duplex allows uplink and downlink transmissions
simultaneously on non-overlapping frequency resources via explicitly defined
uplink and downlink sub-bands in each timeslot. Thus, we propose a sub-band
full-duplex cell-free massive MIMO system with active downlink sensing on
downlink sub-bands and uplink communication on uplink sub-band. In the proposed
system, the target illumination signal is transmitted on the downlink (radar)
sub-band whereas uplink users transmit on the uplink (communication) sub-band.
By assuming efficient suppression of inter-sub-band interference between radar
and communication sub-bands, uplink communication and radar signals can be
efficiently processed without mutual interference. We show that each AP can
estimate sensing parameters with high accuracy in SBFD cell-free massive MIMO
JCAS systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动调制分类技术的进步使得非合作通信场景中的信号感知和识别技术得到发展，但也让窃听者能够有效拦截无线通信环境中的用户信号。为了保护通信链路中的用户隐私，需要开发对抗性扰动生成方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效保护无线通信中的用户隐私，防止信号被自动调制分类系统识别和拦截。

Abstract: The advancements in Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) have propelled
the development of signal sensing and identification technologies in
non-cooperative communication scenarios but also enable eavesdroppers to
effectively intercept user signals in wireless communication environments. To
protect user privacy in communication links, we have optimized the adversarial
example generation model and introduced a novel framework for generating
adversarial perturbations for transmitted signals. This framework implements
dual-domain constraints in both the time and frequency domains, ensuring that
the adversarial perturbation cannot be filtered out. Comparative experiments
confirm the superiority of the proposed method and the concealment of the
adversarial examples it generates.

*Mahmut Kemal Ercan,Alireza Pourafzal,Musa Furkan Keskin,Sinan Gezici,Henk Wymeersch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种OFDM导频失真方法，通过优化子载波失真向量来混淆到达时间估计，同时保持通信性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保持通信性能的同时，通过信号级机制控制到达时间的可观测性，无需协议更改或人工路径注入。

Method: 设计复杂子载波失真向量，使用Dinkelbach变换和凸差更新求解广义分数规划问题。

Result: 优化的失真提高了失配模糊函数的旁瓣，显著降低了延迟估计精度，同时在宽信噪比范围内仅产生边际容量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种在通信约束下控制到达时间可观测性的有效信号级机制。

Abstract: We study uplink orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot
distortion to deliberately obfuscate time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation at a
single base station while preserving communication performance. We design a
complex per-subcarrier distortion vector that increases sidelobes of the
mismatched ambiguity function (MAF) relative to its mainlobe, using two
objectives: the sidelobe-to-peak level ratio and the integrated sidelobe level.
The design is subject to a transmit-power budget and a proximity
(dissimilarity) constraint around the communication-optimal pilot.
Communication impact is quantied by a capacity-motivated lower bound obtained
from the linear minimum mean-squared error error covariance with a mismatched
channel estimate. The resulting generalized fractional program is solved with
Dinkelbach's transform and a difference-of-convex update that yields a
closed-form Karush-Kuhn-Tucker step. Simulations on a single-input
single-output OFDM link show that the optimized distortions raise MAF sidelobes
and degrade delay estimation, as validated by a mismatched maximum-likelihood
ToA estimator, while incurring only marginal capacity loss over a broad
signal-to-noise ratio range. The method requires no protocol changes or
artificial path injection and provides a signal-level mechanism to control ToA
observability under communication constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了全双工ISAC系统中的联合优化问题，为多目标场景下的通信-感知权衡提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a full-duplex (FD) Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) system, in which the base station (BS) performs downlink
and uplink communications with multiple users while simultaneously sensing
multiple targets. In the scope of this work, we assume a narrowband and static
scenario, aiming to focus on the beamforming and power allocation strategies.
We propose a joint beamforming strategy for designing transmit and receive
beamformer vectors at the BS. The optimization problem aims to maximize the
communication sum-rate, which is critical for ensuring high-quality service to
users, while also maintaining accurate sensing performance for detection tasks
and adhering to maximum power constraints for efficient resource usage. The
optimal receive beamformers are first derived using a closed-form Generalized
Rayleigh Quotient (GRQ) solution, reducing the variables to be optimized. Then,
the remaining problem is solved using floating-point Genetic Algorithms (GA).
The numerical results show that the proposed GA-based solution demonstrates up
to a 98% enhancement in sum-rate compared to a baseline half-duplex ISAC system
and provides better performance than a benchmark algorithm from the literature.
Additionally, it offers insights into sensing performance effects on beam
patterns as well as communicationsensing trade-offs in multi-target scenarios.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as key enablers for low-altitude
wireless network (LAWN), particularly when terrestrial networks are
unavailable. In such scenarios, the environmental topology is typically
unknown; hence, designing efficient and safe UAV trajectories is essential yet
challenging. To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training
and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated
sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground
users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT
server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs
accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV
sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight
safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme
that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the
twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous
trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring
obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission
completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and
efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.

### [16] [Towards actionable hypotension prediction -- predicting catecholamine therapy initiation in the intensive care unit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24287)
*Richard Koebe,Noah Saibel,Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz,Simon Schäfer,Nils Strodthoff*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个机器学习模型来预测ICU患者是否需要开始使用儿茶酚胺治疗，相比传统基于固定血压阈值的低血压预测，这种方法更贴近临床决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU患者低血压常见且危及生命，儿茶酚胺治疗是关键的干预步骤。现有机器学习模型主要预测低血压事件，忽略了治疗升级的临床决策过程。预测儿茶酚胺起始使用能提供更具临床操作性的决策支持。

Method: 使用MIMIC-III数据库，将儿茶酚胺起始使用建模为15分钟预测窗口内的二元事件。输入特征包括两小时滑动平均动脉压窗口的统计描述符、人口统计学、生命体征、合并症和当前治疗。采用XGBoost模型并通过SHAP进行解释。

Result: 模型AUROC达到0.822，显著优于基于MAP<65的低血压基线（AUROC 0.686）。SHAP分析显示近期MAP值、MAP趋势和当前治疗是主要预测因子。在男性、年轻患者、高BMI患者以及无合并症或同时用药的患者中表现更好。

Conclusion: 基于MAP动态、治疗背景和患者特征预测儿茶酚胺起始使用，支持治疗升级的关键决策，将重点从基于阈值的警报转向可操作的决策支持。该方法在自然事件不平衡的广泛ICU人群中可行。

Abstract: Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening.
Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both
undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML)
models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting,
overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting
catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent
administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real
decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine
initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input
features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context
window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing
treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and
interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an
AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65,
AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP
trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant
predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger
patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without
comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation
based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports
the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from
threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is
feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work
should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to
include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension
prediction systems.

*Yiming Zhu,Zhuhong Zhu,Xiaodong Xu,Hongwei Hou,Wenjin Wang,Rui Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种与CP-OFDMA框架兼容的恒包络波形设计，解决了OFDM功率效率低的问题，同时降低了收发器复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM在现代无线通信系统中广泛应用，但其包络波动大导致功率效率受限。现有高效功率波形大多与CP-OFDMA框架不兼容，在多用户下行传输中效果不佳。

Method: 从通用CE FDMA信号模型出发，开发CP-OFDMA兼容波形结构，设计优化CE约束脉冲整形滤波器；优化时域二进制导频序列，提出多阶段信道估计方法；设计低复杂度MRC辅助LMMSE均衡器；开发多用户下行CE传输方案。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方案在误码率性能上接近理想情况，同时相比现有CE波形解决方案显著降低了收发器复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出的恒包络波形设计在保持与CP-OFDMA框架完全兼容的同时，实现了低复杂度收发器架构，为多用户下行传输提供了有效的功率效率解决方案。

Abstract: OFDM is widely adopted in modern wireless communication systems, but its
power efficiency is limited by high envelope fluctuations. Although various
high power-efficiency waveforms have been proposed, most are incompatible with
the CP-OFDMA framework and remain ineffective in multi-user downlink
transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a constant-envelope (CE)
waveform design, which enables low-complexity transceiver architectures while
maintaining full compatibility with the prevailing CP-OFDMA framework.
Specifically, we start from a general CE FDMA signal model and develop a
CP-OFDMA-compatible waveform implementation structure, followed by the design
of an optimized CE-constrained pulse-shaping filter to suppress out-of-band
emissions. To tackle channel estimation challenge under non-flat
frequency-domain pilots induced by CE modulation, we optimize the time-domain
binary pilot sequence to achieve frequency-domain CE properties, and then
propose a multi-stage method combining delay-domain denoising with power delay
profile estimation to facilitate reduced-dimension LMMSE estimation.
Subsequently, we design a low-complexity maximum ratio combining-aided LMMSE
equalizer by exploiting the periodicity and conjugate symmetry of the CE
received signals. To mitigate the downlink peak-to-average power ratio increase
caused by FDMA, we further develop a multi-user downlink CE transmission scheme
including multiple access mechanism, downlink control information design, and
corresponding system-level implementation, which ensures compatibility with the
New Radio standard. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
achieves bit error rate performance close to the ideal case while significantly
reducing transceiver complexity compared to existing CE waveform solutions.

Motivation: TDD系统利用信道互易性获取下行CSI，但用户移动性和处理延迟导致信道老化，降低CSI准确性，影响链路自适应和系统性能

Method: 提出基于学习的CSI预测框架，在有效SINR域进行预测，使用EESM映射确保与5G标准兼容。比较了全连接DNN和LSTM网络两种模型

Result: LSTM预测器在中等多普勒条件下，NMSE改善达2dB，吞吐量增益达1.2Mbps，优于无预测基线

Conclusion: 轻量级AI基CSI预测能有效缓解信道老化，增强TDD 5G系统的链路自适应能力，具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Time division duplexing (TDD) has become the dominant duplexing mode in 5G
and beyond due to its ability to exploit channel reciprocity for efficient
downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, channel aging
caused by user mobility and processing delays degrades the accuracy of CSI,
leading to suboptimal link adaptation and loss of performance. To address this
issue, we propose a learning-based CSI prediction framework that leverages
temporal correlations in wireless channels to forecast future signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) values. The prediction operates in the
effective SINR domain, obtained via exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM),
ensuring full compatibility with existing 5G standards without requiring
continuous pilot signaling. Two models are considered: a fully connected deep
neural network (DNN) and an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based network. The
simulation results show that the LSTM predictor achieves an improvement of up
to 2 dB in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and a gain of up to 1.2 Mbps
throughput over a baseline without prediction under moderate Doppler
conditions. These results confirm the potential of lightweight AI-based CSI
prediction to effectively mitigate channel aging and enhance link adaptation in
TDD 5G systems.

Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, implementing
AI-based techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging
research topic. Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and
estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by
traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver
efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI
problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently
deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with
traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver
design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential
of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions
brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further
adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.

*Magnus Heimpel,Irena Hajnsek,Othmar Frey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了三种用于多时相InSAR相位链接的质量评估系数，用于筛选可靠像素点：基于闭合相位的内部一致性系数、拟合优度系数和模糊度系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式散射体的多时相InSAR处理中，相位信息通常不一致，需要评估估计的相位历史是否可靠，以排除不可靠像素点。

Method: 在统一的数学框架内提出了三种归一化质量系数：闭合相位系数量化相干矩阵中相位信息的内部一致性；拟合优度系数评估相位历史估计对原始相位信息的拟合程度；模糊度系数比较原始估计与正交替代方案的拟合优度。

Result: 在瑞士维什普的TerraSAR-X数据实验中，闭合相位系数有效预筛选稳定区域，拟合优度系数与现有质量指标一致且系统性地推广了它们，模糊度系数标记拟合良好但不稳定的解。

Conclusion: 这三种系数共同实现了分布式散射体干涉处理中系统性的像素选择和质控。

Abstract: In multi-temporal InSAR, phase linking refers to the estimation of a
single-reference interferometric phase history from the information contained
in the coherence matrix of a distributed scatterer. Since the phase information
in the coherence matrix is typically inconsistent, the extent to which the
estimated phase history captures it must be assessed to exclude unreliable
pixels from further processing. We introduce three quality criteria in the form
of coefficients, for threshold-based pixel selection: a coefficient based on
closure phase that quantifies the internal consistency of the phase information
in the coherence matrix; a goodness-of-fit coefficient that quantifies how well
a resulting phase history estimate approximates the phase information according
to the characteristic optimization model of a given phase linking method; and
an ambiguity coefficient that compares the goodness of fit of the original
estimate with that of an orthogonal alternative. We formulate the phase linking
methods and these criteria within a unified mathematical framework and discuss
computational and algorithmic aspects. Unlike existing goodness-of-fit
indicators, the proposed coefficients are normalized to the unit interval with
explicit noise-floor correction, improving interpretability across stacks of
different size. Experiments on TerraSAR-X data over Visp, Switzerland, indicate
that the closure phase coefficient effectively pre-screens stable areas, the
goodness-of-fit coefficient aligns with and systematically generalizes
established quality indicators, and the ambiguity coefficient flags solutions
that fit well but are unstable. Together, the coefficients enable systematic
pixel selection and quality control in the interferometric processing of
distributed scatterers.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are poised to seamlessly integrate communication,
computing, localization, and sensing functionalities, ensuring high reliability
and trustworthiness. This paper introduces Smart Sensing Feedback (SSF), a
limited-feedback framework designed to enhance sensing capabilities while
maintaining communication performance. SSF adapts the concept of retransmission
from communication to sensing. Specifically, we focus on downlink (DL) bistatic
sensing, where the User Equipment (UE) performs measurements from reflected
sensing signals and provides feedback to the network (NW). In sensing services,
UE reporting can vary significantly due to dynamic factors such as target
characteristics, environmental conditions, and UE status. Our results
demonstrate that SSF significantly improves sensing quality while preserving
communication efficiency. Additionally, it enhances key performance metrics
such as probability of detection, latency, and power consumption. These
improvements underscore SSF's ability to deliver robust, low-overhead feedback
and adaptability to support a wide range of ISAC applications.

Conclusion: 该宽带超表面可作为提高雷达和无线系统频谱效率和安全性性能的有效候选方案。

Abstract: Digital metasurfaces have attracted significant attention in recent years due
to their ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves for secure sensing
and communication. However, most reported metasurfaces operate at relatively
high frequencies, primarily due to the constraints imposed by the physical
scale of the dielectric substrate, thus limiting their full-wave system
applications. In this work, a wideband digital reflective metasurface is
presented for capable of dynamically controlling EM waves, with multifunctional
applications in the lower-frequency S-band. The metasurface is composed of
electronically reconfigurable meta-atoms with wideband characteristics, and
designed by using trapezoidal and M-shaped patches connected by a pin diode.
Simulation results show that the proposed digital metasurface could achieve
wideband 1-bit phase quantization with a stable phase difference within 180
degree +/- 25 degree and small reflection loss below 0.6 dB from 2.72 to 3.25
GHz. To validate the proposed design, a 20x20-unit metasurface array was
designed, simulated and fabricated. By dynamically adjusting the coding
sequence, the metasurface could enable multi-mode orbital angular momentum
(OAM) beam generation, dynamic beam scanning, and precise direction finding.
These capabilities support secure sensing and secure communications through
high-resolution target detection and anti-jamming beam steering, as well as
physical-layer security. The proposed wideband metasurface may serve as an
effective candidate for enhancing spectral efficiency and security performance
in radar and wireless systems.

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves automatic speech recognition (ASR) by integrating
external knowledge, such as user-specific phrases or entities, during decoding.
In this work, we use an attention-based biasing decoder to produce scores for
candidate phrases based on acoustic information extracted by an ASR encoder,
which can be used to filter out unlikely phrases and to calculate bonus for
shallow-fusion biasing. We introduce a per-token discriminative objective that
encourages higher scores for ground-truth phrases while suppressing
distractors. Experiments on the Librispeech biasing benchmark show that our
method effectively filters out majority of the candidate phrases, and
significantly improves recognition accuracy under different biasing conditions
when the scores are used in shallow fusion biasing. Our approach is modular and
can be used with any ASR system, and the filtering mechanism can potentially
boost performance of other biasing methods.

Abstract: Audio-visual captioning aims to generate holistic scene descriptions by
jointly modeling sound and vision. While recent methods have improved
performance through sophisticated modality fusion, it remains unclear to what
extent the two modalities are complementary in current audio-visual captioning
models and how robust these models are when one modality is degraded. We
address these questions by conducting systematic modality robustness tests on
LAVCap, a state-of-the-art audio-visual captioning model, in which we
selectively suppress or corrupt the audio or visual streams to quantify
sensitivity and complementarity. The analysis reveals a pronounced bias toward
the audio stream in LAVCap. To evaluate how balanced audio-visual captioning
models are in their use of both modalities, we augment AudioCaps with textual
annotations that jointly describe the audio and visual streams, yielding the
AudioVisualCaps dataset. In our experiments, we report LAVCap baseline results
on AudioVisualCaps. We also evaluate the model under modality robustness tests
on AudioVisualCaps and the results indicate that LAVCap trained on
AudioVisualCaps exhibits less modality bias than when trained on AudioCaps.

Abstract: Dereverberation has long been a crucial research topic in speech processing,
aiming to alleviate the adverse effects of reverberation in voice communication
and speech interaction systems. Among existing approaches, forward
convolutional prediction (FCP) has recently attracted attention. It typically
employs a deep neural network to predict the direct-path signal and
subsequently estimates a linear prediction filter to suppress residual
reverberation. However, a major drawback of this approach is that the required
linear prediction filter is often excessively long, leading to considerable
computational complexity. To address this, our work proposes a novel FCP method
based on Kronecker product (KP) decomposition, in which the long prediction
filter is modeled as the KP of two much shorter filters. This decomposition
significantly reduces the computational cost. An adaptive algorithm is then
provided to iteratively update these shorter filters online. Experimental
results show that, compared to conventional methods, our approach achieves
competitive dereverberation performance while substantially reducing
computational cost.

Abstract: Surround sound systems commonly distribute loudspeakers along standardized
layouts for multichannel audio reproduction. However in less controlled
environments, practical layouts vary in loudspeaker quantity, placement, and
listening locations / areas. Deviations from standard layouts introduce
sound-field errors that degrade acoustic timbre, imaging, and clarity of audio
content reproduction. This work introduces both Bayesian loudspeaker
normalization and content panning optimization methods for sound-field
correction. Conjugate prior distributions over loudspeaker-listener directions
update estimated layouts for non-stationary listening locations; digital
filters adapt loudspeaker acoustic responses to a common reference target at
the estimated listening area without acoustic measurements. Frequency-domain
panning coefficients are then optimized via sensitivity / efficiency objectives
subject to spatial, electrical, and acoustic domain constraints; normalized and
panned loudspeakers form virtual loudspeakers in standardized layouts for
accurate multichannel reproduction. Experiments investigate robustness of
Bayesian adaptation, and panning optimizations in practical applications.

Abstract: We present a neuromuscular speech interface that translates electromyographic
(EMG) signals collected from orofacial muscles during speech articulation
directly into audio. We show that self-supervised speech (SS) representations
exhibit a strong linear relationship with the electrical power of muscle action
potentials: SS features can be linearly mapped to EMG power with a correlation
of $r = 0.85$. Moreover, EMG power vectors corresponding to different
articulatory gestures form structured and separable clusters in feature space.
This relationship: $\text{SS features}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{linear mapping}}$
$\text{EMG power}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{gesture-specific clustering}}$
$\text{articulatory movements}$, highlights that SS models implicitly encode
articulatory mechanisms. Leveraging this property, we directly map EMG signals
to SS feature space and synthesize speech, enabling end-to-end EMG-to-speech
generation without explicit articulatory models and vocoder training.

Result: 在VGGSound上将FAD降至0.40，显著超越最佳分类器自由引导基线，在FD、IS和对齐指标上持续优于现有方法，在UnAV-100基准测试中泛化良好。

Conclusion: 模型引导的双角色对齐是条件视频到音频生成中强大且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: We present MGAudio, a novel flow-based framework for open-domain
video-to-audio generation, which introduces model-guided dual-role alignment as
a central design principle. Unlike prior approaches that rely on
classifier-based or classifier-free guidance, MGAudio enables the generative
model to guide itself through a dedicated training objective designed for
video-conditioned audio generation. The framework integrates three main
components: (1) a scalable flow-based Transformer model, (2) a dual-role
alignment mechanism where the audio-visual encoder serves both as a
conditioning module and as a feature aligner to improve generation quality, and
(3) a model-guided objective that enhances cross-modal coherence and audio
realism. MGAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance on VGGSound, reducing
FAD to 0.40, substantially surpassing the best classifier-free guidance
baselines, and consistently outperforms existing methods across FD, IS, and
alignment metrics. It also generalizes well to the challenging UnAV-100
benchmark. These results highlight model-guided dual-role alignment as a
powerful and scalable paradigm for conditional video-to-audio generation. Code

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) has recently attracted attention as a low-power
alternative to neural networks due to its simple and interpretable inference
mechanisms. However, its performance on speech-related tasks remains limited.
This paper proposes TsetlinKWS, the first algorithm-hardware co-design
framework for the Convolutional Tsetlin Machine (CTM) on the 12-keyword
spotting task. Firstly, we introduce a novel Mel-Frequency Spectral Coefficient
and Spectral Flux (MFSC-SF) feature extraction scheme together with spectral
convolution, enabling the CTM to reach its first-ever competitive accuracy of
87.35% on the 12-keyword spotting task. Secondly, we develop an Optimized
Grouped Block-Compressed Sparse Row (OG-BCSR) algorithm that achieves a
remarkable 9.84$\times$ reduction in model size, significantly improving the
storage efficiency on CTMs. Finally, we propose a state-driven architecture
tailored for the CTM, which simultaneously exploits data reuse and sparsity to
achieve high energy efficiency. The full system is evaluated in 65 nm process
technology, consuming 16.58 $\mu$W at 0.7 V with a compact 0.63 mm$^2$ core
area. TsetlinKWS requires only 907k logic operations per inference,
representing a 10$\times$ reduction compared to the state-of-the-art KWS
accelerators, positioning the CTM as a highly-efficient candidate for
ultra-low-power speech applications.

Abstract: Purpose: Surgical scene understanding is key to advancing computer-aided and
intelligent surgical systems. Current approaches predominantly rely on visual
data or end-to-end learning, which limits fine-grained contextual modeling.
This work aims to enhance surgical scene representations by integrating 3D
acoustic information, enabling temporally and spatially aware multimodal
understanding of surgical environments.
  Methods: We propose a novel framework for generating 4D audio-visual
representations of surgical scenes by projecting acoustic localization
information from a phased microphone array onto dynamic point clouds from an
RGB-D camera. A transformer-based acoustic event detection module identifies
relevant temporal segments containing tool-tissue interactions which are
spatially localized in the audio-visual scene representation. The system was
experimentally evaluated in a realistic operating room setup during simulated
surgical procedures performed by experts.
  Results: The proposed method successfully localizes surgical acoustic events
in 3D space and associates them with visual scene elements. Experimental
evaluation demonstrates accurate spatial sound localization and robust fusion
of multimodal data, providing a comprehensive, dynamic representation of
surgical activity.
  Conclusion: This work introduces the first approach for spatial sound
localization in dynamic surgical scenes, marking a significant advancement
toward multimodal surgical scene representations. By integrating acoustic and
visual data, the proposed framework enables richer contextual understanding and
provides a foundation for future intelligent and autonomous surgical systems.

Conclusion: BELLE为连续值自回归TTS提供了一种有效的建模方法，能够处理语音多样性并实现可靠的采样策略。

Abstract: Codec-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have recently gained traction for
their efficiency and strong performance in voice cloning. However, codec-based
TTS faces limitations due to the challenges of pretraining robust speech codecs
and the quality degradation introduced by quantization errors. Emerging
evidence suggests that continuous-valued generative models can alleviate these
issues and serve as a promising alternative. Yet, effectively modelling diverse
speech patterns and developing reliable sampling strategies for
continuous-valued autoregressive (AR) TTS remains underexplored. In this work,
we propose BELLE, Bayesian evidential learning with language modelling for TTS,
a novel continuous-valued AR framework that directly predicts mel-spectrograms
from textual input. BELLE treats each mel-spectrogram frame as a Gaussian
distribution sampled from a learned hyper distribution, enabling principled
uncertainty estimation, particularly in scenarios with parallel data (i.e., one
text-audio prompt paired with multiple speech samples). To obtain such data,
diverse speech samples are synthesized using multiple pre-trained TTS models
given the same text-audio prompts, which are distilled into BELLE via Bayesian
evidential learning. Experimental results indicate that BELLE demonstrates
highly competitive performance compared with the current best open-source TTS
models, even though BELLE is trained on a large amount of synthetic data and
uses only approximately one-tenth of their training data. Audio samples
generated by BELLE are available at https://belletts.github.io/Belle/. The
code, checkpoints, and synthetic data will be released after the paper is
accepted.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定波束形成虽然稳定但不适应变化的声学条件，传统的自适应凸组合算法在高度非平稳场景（如快速移动干扰）中跟踪能力不足。

Method: 使用神经网络估计多个无失真差分波束形成器的组合权重，采用帧在线处理方式。

Conclusion: 基于神经网络的融合框架在动态声学环境中优于传统自适应方法，为波束形成提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fixed beamforming is widely used in practice since it does not depend on the
estimation of noise statistics and provides relatively stable performance.
However, a single beamformer cannot adapt to varying acoustic conditions, which
limits its interference suppression capability. To address this, adaptive
convex combination (ACC) algorithms have been introduced, where the outputs of
multiple fixed beamformers are linearly combined to improve robustness.
Nevertheless, ACC often fails in highly non-stationary scenarios, such as
rapidly moving interference, since its adaptive updates cannot reliably track
rapid changes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a frame-online neural
fusion framework for multiple distortionless differential beamformers, which
estimates the combination weights through a neural network. Compared with
conventional ACC, the proposed method adapts more effectively to dynamic
acoustic environments, achieving stronger interference suppression while
maintaining the distortionless constraint.

Motivation: 传统MFCC特征缺乏时间信息，小波变换虽然提供时频信息但频率分辨率不足且计算复杂。需要结合两者优点开发更高效的特征提取方法

Method: 提出时域梅尔频率小波系数(TMFWC)方法，在时域结合小波变换概念提取梅尔尺度特征，避免额外的时频转换和复杂的小波提取过程

Result: TMFWC方法显著降低了计算负担，与储层计算方法结合后大幅提升了音频信号处理的效率

Conclusion: TMFWC成功结合了MFCC和小波变换的优点，在保持特征质量的同时降低了计算复杂度，为音频信号处理提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech
signal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most
widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition
applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering
taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it
provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the
information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet
transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency
information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of
non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform
frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in
analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies,
and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to
develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet
transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features.
The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods
require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of
Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are
proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the
concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of
time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining
our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique
with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the
efficiency of audio signal processing.

TL;DR: STAR-Bench是一个新的音频基准测试，专注于测量音频4D智能（在时间和3D空间中对声音动态进行推理），揭示了现有模型在细粒度感知推理方面的显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型和音频-语言模型基准主要测试可从文本标题中恢复的语义，掩盖了在细粒度感知推理方面的不足，需要一个新的基准来测量音频4D智能。

Method: STAR-Bench结合了基础声学感知设置（六个属性，包括绝对和相对机制）和整体时空推理设置（包括连续和离散过程的片段重新排序，以及静态定位、多源关系和动态轨迹的空间任务）。数据收集采用程序合成、物理模拟音频和四阶段人工标注流程。

Result: 评估19个模型显示与人类存在显著差距，并揭示了能力层次：闭源模型受限于细粒度感知，而开源模型在感知、知识和推理方面均落后。相比先前基准，STAR-Bench导致准确率大幅下降（时间任务-31.5%，空间任务-35.2%）。

Conclusion: STAR-Bench为开发具有更强大物理世界理解能力的未来模型提供了关键见解和清晰路径，强调了在音频4D智能方面仍需重大改进。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models and Large
Audio-Language Models, existing audio benchmarks largely test semantics that
can be recovered from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained
perceptual reasoning. We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as
reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to
measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six
attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete
processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source
relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two
methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use
procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we
follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection
based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only
answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops
(-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically
hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared
with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked
by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception,
knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear
path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of
the physical world.

Online research is quicker and more inclusive, but most participants\nlack calibration equipment and their sound sources are uncalibrated and\ndiverse. This article explains how the open-source EasyEyes.app calibrates\nloudspeakers online. A library of smartphone-microphone profiles allows\nEasyEyes to use the participant's phone to calibrate their computer's\nloudspeaker in three minutes. Participants select their phone model, which is\nverified by screen size. Calibration employs the Novak et al. nonsynchronous\nmaximum-length-sequence (MLS) algorithm. The computer's loudspeaker is\ncorrected by convolving its input with the inverse of its impulse response.\nResearchers can contribute to the open-access library by calibrating phones\nwith a measurement microphone. In the library, each profile is linked back to\nthe profile used to produce it, back to the manufacturer profile of a\nmeasurement microphone. Correction accuracy is such that playing the\nflat-spectrum MLS through the corrected loudspeaker produces a nearly flat\nspectrum, with standard deviation less than 3 dB. A survey shows that a library\nof 94 phone models from major brands will support most participants in the USA\n(87%) and UK (80%). This method facilitates efficient and inclusive online\nhearing research."}

State-of-the-art systems extract embeddings from an adapted audio\nencoder and detect anomalies via nearest-neighbor search, but fine tuning on\nnoisy machine sounds often acts like a denoising objective, suppressing noise\nand reducing generalization under mismatched mixtures or inconsistent labeling.\nTraining-free systems with frozen self-supervised learning (SSL) encoders avoid\nthis issue and show strong first-shot generalization, yet their performance\ndrops when mixture embeddings deviate from clean-source embeddings. We propose\nto improve SSL backbones with a retain-not-denoise strategy that better\npreserves information from mixed sound sources. The approach combines a\nmulti-label audio tagging loss with a mixture alignment loss that aligns\nstudent mixture embeddings to convex teacher embeddings of clean and noise\ninputs.

In\na previous study, we conducted an SI experiment with 14 older adult (OA)\nlisteners, using speech-in-noise sounds that were either processed with an\nideal ratio mask (IRM) enhancement technique or left unprocessed. The current\nstudy involved an SI experiment with 15 young, normal-hearing (YNH) listeners.\nThis experiment used simulated HL sounds processed with the WHIS simulator that\nreflected the hearing level of a specific OA from the previous study. The\nresults showed that the target OA's SI scores were higher than the average YNH\nscores. This implies that the target OA's higher-level processes may be more\neffective than those of the average YNH. To understand the characteristics of\nother OAs, we used the GESI objective intelligibility measure to predict SI.\nFirst, we confirmed that GESI could fairly accurately predict the SI scores for\nboth the YNH and OA listeners. Next, we predicted the SI scores of the 14 OA\nlisteners using the parameters estimated in the YNH experiment. The results\nshowed that some OAs had higher SI scores than the average YNH, while one OA\nhad lower scores. These differences in SI scores may reflect variations in the\nefficiency of higher-level processes.These results imply that WHIS and GESI\ncould facilitate contrastive experiments between YNH and OA listeners,\nregardless of hearing level. This would allow us to study the effects of\nhigher-level processes in OA listeners individually."}

Recent advancements in deep\nlearning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques.\nHowever, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that\nnecessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered\ncomputing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless\nnetworks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for\ndistributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to\nperform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this\ninvestigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this\ndistributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying\nmodulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective\nof the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the\ncentralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate\nof 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around\n41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods\nexhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers,\nthe initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while\nsubstantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized\nmodel. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature\nmap, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies\na substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach.\nThese findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly\nenhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of\nbandwidth-limited wireless networks."}

These phonation\ntypes are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and\nsocial meaning in speech.

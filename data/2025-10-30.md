### [1] [Distributed learning for automatic modulation recognition in bandwidth-limited networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24722)
*Narges Rashvand,Kenneth Witham,Gabriel Maldonado,Vinit Katariya,Aly Sultan,Gunar Schirner,Hamed Tabkhi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于分布式学习的自动调制识别方法，通过多接收器协作在带宽受限的无线网络中实现高效调制识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式AMR方法需要将所有训练数据收集到高性能计算设备上处理，这在带宽受限的无线网络中不实用。

Method: 1. 基于共识投票的分布式方法：六个接收器投票决定调制类型，带宽需求降至集中式方法的1/256；2. 特征图共享方法：各接收器共享特征图，由中心节点聚合，带宽需求降至集中式方法的1/8。

Result: 集中式AMR（6个接收器）准确率达91%，单个接收器准确率仅41%。两种分布式方法在显著降低带宽需求的同时提升了准确率。

Conclusion: 分布式AMR方法能够在有效应对带宽受限无线网络约束的同时，显著提升调制识别准确率。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is critical in identifying various
modulation types in wireless communication systems. Recent advancements in deep
learning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques.
However, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that
necessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered
computing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless
networks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for
distributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to
perform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this
investigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this
distributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying
modulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective
of the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the
centralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate
of 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around
41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods
exhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers,
the initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while
substantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized
model. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature
map, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies
a substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach.
These findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly
enhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of
bandwidth-limited wireless networks.

### [2] [Ambient Backscatter Communication Assisted by Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24725)
*Masoud Kaveh,Farshad Rostami Ghadi,Riku Jantti,Kai-Kit Wong,F. Javier Lopez-Martinez*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了将流体可重构智能表面(FRIS)集成到环境反向散射通信(AmBC)系统中，通过动态调整流体元件位置来增强空间适应性，并使用粒子群优化算法优化配置，显著提升了系统吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RIS具有固定位置的元件，在直接链路弱或被障碍物阻挡的场景中性能受限。FRIS通过流体元件的动态位置调整提供更好的空间适应性，改善AmBC系统性能。

Method: 开发了FRIS辅助的AmBC系统模型，将FRIS元件位置优化建模为非凸问题，采用粒子群优化(PSO)算法来获得近最优的流体元件配置。

Result: 仿真结果表明，FRIS辅助的AmBC系统在可实现吞吐量方面显著优于传统的RIS基AmBC系统。

Conclusion: FRIS通过动态位置调整增强了AmBC系统的空间适应性，在弱直接链路场景下提供了显著的性能提升，证明了流体可重构智能表面在环境反向散射通信中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of a fluid reconfigurable intelligent
surface (FRIS) into ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems. Unlike
conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed position
elements, FRIS employs fluidic elements that can dynamically adjust their
positions, offering enhanced spatial adaptability. We develop a system model
where an AmBC tag communicates with a reader through an FRIS, which is
particularly beneficial in scenarios where the direct tag-to-reader link is
weak or blocked by obstacles. The achievable backscatter rate is analyzed, and
the optimization of FRIS element positions is formulated as a non-convex
problem. To address this, we employ particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain
near-optimal configurations of the fluid elements. Simulation results
demonstrate that FRIS-aided AmBC significantly outperforms conventional
RIS-based AmBC systems in terms of achievable throughput.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了在现实环境中获取足够上下文数据的挑战，为理解情绪状态与行为关系提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Measuring emotional states in transportation contexts is an emerging field.
Methods based on self-reported emotions are limited by their low granularity
and their susceptibility to memory bias. In contrast, methods based on
physiological indicators provide continuous data, enabling researchers to
measure changes in emotional states with high detail and accuracy. Not only are
emotions important in the analysis, but understanding what triggers emotional
changes is equally important. Uncontrolled variables such as traffic
conditions, pedestrian interactions, and infrastructure remain a significant
challenge, as they can have a great impact on emotional states. Explaining the
reasons behind these emotional states requires gathering sufficient and proper
contextual data, which can be extremely difficult in real-world environments.
This paper addresses these challenges by applying an innovative approach,
extracting contextual data (expert annotator level) from recorded multimedia
using large language models (LLMs). In this paper, data are collected from an
urban cycling case study of the City of Santiago, Chile. The applied models
focus on understanding how different environments and traffic situations affect
the emotional states and behaviors of the participants using physiological
data. Sequences of images, extracted from the recorded videos, are processed by
LLMs to obtain semantic descriptions of the environment. These discrete,
although dense and detailed, contextual data are integrated into a hybrid
model, where fatigue and arousal serve as latent variables influencing observed
cycling behaviors (inferred from GPS data) like waiting, accelerating, braking,
etc. The study confirms that cycling decisions are influenced by stress-related
emotions and highlights the strong impact of urban characteristics and traffic
conditions on cyclist behavior.

Conclusion: 该方案展示了实际ARIS部署的强大潜力，能够有效应对无人机飞行中的动态变化，提升无线网络性能。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for enhancing wireless networks. Compared to terrestrial RIS deployed on
building facades, aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on quadrotor unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) offers superior flexibility and extended coverage. However, the
inevitable tilt and altitude variations of a quadrotor UAV during flight may
lead to severe beam misalignment, significantly degrading ARIS's performance.
To address this challenge, we propose a Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme
that jointly optimizes the altitude and trajectory of the ARIS by leveraging
the UAV's dynamic model. Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy
consumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS),
we jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS
beamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control
nature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the
problem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm
with prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies.
Based on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling
and bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance,
achieving approximately 14.4\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison
to the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive
trajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS
tilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.

Conclusion: 深度学习特别是Transformer架构在脑电信号建模中具有优势，但内部言语的解码仍然面临巨大困难，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: This thesis delves into the world of non-invasive electrophysiological brain
signals like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG),
focusing on modelling and decoding such data. The research aims to investigate
what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert
speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The
thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work.
A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in
electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or
between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset
variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep
learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli
using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep
learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods
to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel
forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based
architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior
capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby
enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's
electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset
containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped
magnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner
speech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and
sessions from a few participants. However, the decoding results are found to be
mostly negative, underscoring the difficulty of decoding inner speech.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: StrikeWatch是一个紧凑型腕戴系统，通过IMU信号在设备上实时进行步态识别，专门检测脚跟与脚前掌着地模式，为跑步者提供视觉和听觉反馈以纠正有害步态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跑步有益健康但不正确的步态模式可能导致受伤，现有步态分析系统笨重且仅限于离线分析。腕戴设备更实用但实时步态识别面临IMU信号噪声、计算资源有限和依赖云连接的挑战。

Method: 提出四种紧凑的深度学习架构（1D-CNN、1D-SepCNN、LSTM和Transformer），在两个嵌入式FPGA上优化能效推理，使用定制硬件原型收集户外跑步数据集，通过自动化部署管道评估所有模型。

Result: 6位量化的1D-SepCNN在iCE40UP5K上实现最高平均F1分数0.847，每次推理仅消耗0.350μJ，延迟0.140ms，支持320mAh电池连续推理13.6天。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型复杂度和硬件效率之间的权衡，紧凑的1D-SepCNN架构在资源受限的嵌入式设备上实现了高效的实时步态识别。

Abstract: Running offers substantial health benefits, but improper gait patterns can
lead to injuries, particularly without expert feedback. While prior gait
analysis systems based on cameras, insoles, or body-mounted sensors have
demonstrated effectiveness, they are often bulky and limited to offline,
post-run analysis. Wrist-worn wearables offer a more practical and
non-intrusive alternative, yet enabling real-time gait recognition on such
devices remains challenging due to noisy Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
signals, limited computing resources, and dependence on cloud connectivity.
This paper introduces StrikeWatch, a compact wrist-worn system that performs
entirely on-device, real-time gait recognition using IMU signals. As a case
study, we target the detection of heel versus forefoot strikes to enable
runners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through visual and auditory
feedback during running. We propose four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN,
1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and optimize them for energy-efficient
inference on two representative embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs): the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 and the Lattice iCE40UP5K. Using our
custom-built hardware prototype, we collect a labeled dataset from outdoor
running sessions and evaluate all models via a fully automated deployment
pipeline. Our results reveal clear trade-offs between model complexity and
hardware efficiency. Evaluated across 12 participants, 6-bit quantized
1D-SepCNN achieves the highest average F1 score of 0.847 while consuming just
0.350 {\mu}J per inference with a latency of 0.140 ms on the iCE40UP5K running
at 20 MHz. This configuration supports up to 13.6 days of continuous inference
on a 320 mAh battery. All datasets and code are available in the GitHub
repository https://github.com/tianheng-ling/StrikeWatch.

### [8] [Comparative Analysis of Data Augmentation for Clinical ECG Classification with STAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24740)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: STAR是一种针对12导联心电图的节拍级数据增强方法，通过在R-R间期进行受控时间扭曲和幅度缩放，保持P-QRS-T顺序不变，提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床12导联心电图分类面临记录条件多样、病理重叠和标签不平衡等挑战，传统数据增强方法可能扭曲诊断关键形态。

Method: STAR在连续R峰之间进行操作，对每个R-R段应用时间扭曲和幅度缩放，保持心电图形态完整性，可与常见1D SE-ResNet风格编码器集成。

Result: STAR提供形态保真变异性，提升跨设备、站点和队列的稳定性，改善罕见类别学习效果，避免临床标志点错位。

Conclusion: STAR为临床心电图分类提供简单可控的数据增强方法，在形态可信度、操作简便性和跨源耐久性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Clinical 12-lead ECG classification remains difficult because of diverse
recording conditions, overlapping pathologies, and pronounced label imbalance
hinder generalization, while unconstrained augmentations risk distorting
diagnostically critical morphology. In this study, Sinusoidal Time--Amplitude
Resampling (STAR) is introduced as a beat-wise augmentation that operates
strictly between successive R-peaks to apply controlled time warping and
amplitude scaling to each R--R segment, preserving the canonical P--QRS--T
order and leaving the head and tail of the trace unchanged. STAR is designed
for practical pipelines and offers: (i) morphology-faithful variability that
broadens training diversity without corrupting peaks or intervals; (ii)
source-resilient training, improving stability across devices, sites, and
cohorts without dataset-specific tuning; (iii) model-agnostic integration with
common 1D SE--ResNet-style ECG encoders backbone; and (iv) better learning on
rare classes via beat-level augmentation, reducing overfitting by resampling
informative beats instead of duplicating whole records. In contrast to global
crops, large shifts, or additive noise, STAR avoids transformations that
suppress or misalign clinical landmarks. A complete Python implementation and a
transparent training workflow are released, aligned with a source-aware,
stratified five-fold protocol over a multi-institutional 12-lead corpus,
thereby facilitating inspection and reuse. Taken together, STAR provides a
simple and controllable augmentation for clinical ECG classification where
trustworthy morphology, operational simplicity, and cross-source durability are
essential.

Abstract: Non-intrusive monitoring of vital signs has become increasingly important in
a variety of healthcare settings. In this paper, we present PulseFi, a novel
low-cost non-intrusive system that uses Wi-Fi sensing and artificial
intelligence to accurately and continuously monitor heart rate and breathing
rate, as well as detect apnea events. PulseFi operates using low-cost commodity
devices, making it more accessible and cost-effective. It uses a signal
processing pipeline to process Wi-Fi telemetry data, specifically Channel State
Information (CSI), that is fed into a custom low-compute Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) neural network model. We evaluate PulseFi using two datasets: one that
we collected locally using ESP32 devices and another that contains recordings
of 118 participants collected using the Raspberry Pi 4B, making the latter the
most comprehensive data set of its kind. Our results show that PulseFi can
effectively estimate heart rate and breathing rate in a seemless non-intrusive
way with comparable or better accuracy than multiple antenna systems that can
be expensive and less accessible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 声音源到达方向估计面临声学特征随时间频率连续变化的挑战，需要有效聚合相关特征并建模时间依赖性，同时平衡模型性能和计算效率。

Method: 提出FA-Stateformer网络：1) 特征聚合模块增强时频维度信息特征；2) 轻量化Conformer架构压缩前馈层减少冗余；3) 时间移位机制扩展卷积感受野；4) 双向Mamba模块高效建模双向时间依赖；5) 自注意力层与Mamba块协同建模。

Result: 大量实验表明FA-Stateformer相比传统架构实现了更优越的性能和效率。

Conclusion: FA-Stateformer通过状态空间和自注意力的协同建模框架，在声音源到达方向估计任务中实现了表示能力和计算效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is
challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across
time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the
ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies
effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model
performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention
collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first
employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across
both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight
Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where
the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter
overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand
the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel
size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba
module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of
temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining
self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a
collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation
capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to
conventional architectures.

*Dong-Hyeon Kang,Ju-Hyeon Nam,Sang-Chul Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: EcoScaleNet是一种高效的卷积全尺度网络，通过分层设计和瓶颈卷积，在保持全感受野覆盖的同时大幅降低计算成本，在ECG分类任务中实现SOTA精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CNN在ECG长序列分类中感受野选择困难的问题，同时克服Omni Scale CNN计算成本过高、阻碍更深更宽模型的缺陷。

Method: 采用分层变体设计，每阶段限制最大核长度以减少冗余；在Omni Scale块前后插入瓶颈卷积来控制通道增长和融合多尺度特征。

Result: 在CODE 15% ECG数据集上，相比OS CNN减少90%参数和99%FLOPs，同时将宏平均F1分数提升2.4%。

Conclusion: EcoScaleNet以极低计算成本实现了长序列ECG分类的SOTA精度，可在普通硬件上实时部署。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
early detection of cardiac abnormalities, yet manual reading is error prone and
existing CNN based classifiers struggle to choose receptive field sizes that
generalize to the long sequences typical of ECGs. Omni Scale CNN (OS CNN)
addresses this by enumerating prime sized kernels inspired by Goldbach
conjecture to cover every scale, but its exhaustive design explodes
computational cost and blocks deeper, wider models. We present Efficient
Convolutional Omni Scale Network (EcoScale-Net), a hierarchical variant that
retains full receptive field coverage while eliminating redundancy. At each
stage, the maximum kernel length is capped to the scale still required after
down sampling, and bottleneck convolutions inserted before and after every Omni
Scale block curtail channel growth and fuse multi scale features. On the large
scale CODE 15% ECG dataset, EcoScaleNet reduces parameters by 90% and FLOPs by
99% compared with OS CNN, while raising macro averaged F1 score by 2.4%. These
results demonstrate that EcoScaleNet delivers SOTA accuracy for long sequence
ECG classification at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling real time
deployment on commodity hardware. Our EcoScaleNet code is available in GitHub
Link.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WPW综合征是一种与心源性猝死相关的先天性心脏病，传统筛查方法依赖心电图解读，限制了大规模和成本效益的筛查。

Method: 回顾性分析包含来自87,836名中国个体的3,566,626份单导联ECG记录，使用NMPA批准的便携式ECG设备，通过AI系统性能验证和随机抽样评估。

Result: AI系统达到45.5%的敏感性和95.9%的特异性，AI阳性结果使确认WPW的风险增加约210倍，AI选择阳性可将医生工作量减少99.5%。

Conclusion: 单导联AI-ECG系统能够实现高效实用的WPW综合征机会性筛查，显著减少医生工作量，支持基于人群的心血管预防。

Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a congenital cardiac condition
associated with sudden cardiac death, with a prevalence of 0.1-0.3%.
Conventional screening relies on electrophysiological testing or 12-lead
electrocardiography interpreted by cardiologists, which limits large-scale and
cost-effective screening. Building on our previous work developing a
single-lead AI-ECG mobile system for atrial fibrillation screening, this study
evaluates its efficiency and effectiveness for opportunistic detection of WPW
syndrome in real-world settings. This retrospective analysis included 3,566,626
single-lead ECG recordings from 87,836 individuals in China, collected using
the NMPA-approved portable ECG device WenXinWuYang. The AI system performance
was validated using cardiologist annotations and random sampling. We quantified
AI-assisted workload reduction and compared review efficiency across
AI-positive and user-initiated workflows. The AI system achieved 45.5%
sensitivity and 95.9% specificity. A positive AI result indicated about 210
times higher risk of confirmed WPW. Focusing on AI-selected positives reduced
physician workload by 99.5%, requiring only 12 reviews to confirm one WPW case,
compared with 909 and 875 in population-wide and user-driven approaches. In
conclusion, this large-scale real-world study demonstrates that a single-lead
AI-ECG system enables efficient and practical opportunistic screening for WPW
syndrome, significantly reducing physician workload and supporting
population-based cardiovascular prevention.

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables biocompatible and energy-efficient
information transfer through chemical signaling, forming a foundational
paradigm for emerging applications in the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) and
intrabody healthcare systems. The realization of this vision critically depends
on developing advanced receiver architectures that merge nanoscale
communication and networking techniques with bio-cyber interfaces, ensuring
energy-efficient, reliable, and low-complexity modulation and detection while
maintaining biocompatibility. To address these challenges, the Flexure-FET MC
receiver was introduced as a mechanically transducing design capable of
detecting both charged and neutral molecular species. In this study, we present
a cylindrical nanowire array-based Flexure-FET MC receiver that enhances design
versatility and scalability through distributed electromechanical coupling in a
suspended-gate configuration. The proposed array architecture offers additional
geometric degrees of freedom, including nanowire radius, length, spacing, and
array size, providing a flexible framework that can be tailored to advanced MC
scenarios. An analytical end-to-end model is developed to characterize the
system's electromechanical response, noise behavior, and information-theoretic
performance, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel capacity. The
results reveal the strong interdependence between geometry, electromechanical
dynamics, and molecular binding processes, enabling tunable control over
sensitivity, noise characteristics, and communication capacity. The enhanced
structural tunability and array configuration of the proposed design provide a
flexible foundation for future mixture-based and spatially modulated MC
systems, paving the way toward scalable and multifunctional receiver
architectures within the IoNT framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DyFrag-MAC的动态分片MAC方案，为不同优先级的流量提供差异化信道接入，通过动态分片普通优先级数据来支持紧急优先级数据的早期传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业信息物理系统中连接设备数量激增，需要可靠和及时的网络服务，现有协议无法动态调整分片大小或抢占低优先级传输。

Method: DyFrag-MAC通过动态分片普通优先级数据，允许紧急优先级数据在低优先级数据传输过程中获得信道接入机会。

Result: 与FROG-MAC和i-DSME相比，DyFrag-MAC在异构流量下的平均延迟和吞吐量性能表现更优。

Conclusion: DyFrag-MAC方案能够有效支持工业CPS中异构优先级流量的差异化服务需求，提供更好的网络性能。

Abstract: Next Generation Media Access Control (NGMA) techniques have been designed to
support diverse applications with heterogeneous priorities. In industrial
cyber-physical systems (CPS), the number of connected devices and systems is
expected to grow significantly, demanding dependable and prompt network
services. In this work, we present a novel scheme, Dynamic Fragmentation-MAC
(DyFrag-MAC) that offers dynamic, differentiated channel access to the traffic
of various priorities. DyFrag-MAC works on fragmenting the data of normal
priority in order to support early delivery of urgent priority data. In prior
work, urgent priority data either had to wait for the complete transmission of
lower-priority packets or relied on multi-channel protocols to gain access. We
compared the proposed fragmentation scheme with FROG-MAC and industrial
Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (i-DSME). FROG-MAC
fragmented the lower priority packets, but did not adjust the fragment size
dynamically, whereas i-DSME utilized multiple channels and adaptive contention
mechanisms; both protocols lack the ability to preempt ongoing lower-priority
transmissions. Hence, the performance evaluation in terms of average delay and
throughput reveals better performance of DyFRAG-MAC for the heterogeneous
traffic.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的基于优先级的MAC协议ADP2-MAC，用于无线体域网中异构流量的高效管理，通过概率性方法动态确定信道轮询间隔，并在预期紧急数据包时中断低优先级传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线体域网中异构流量具有不同优先级，需要高效管理以优化可靠性、延迟和能效。最小化数据包生成到接收的延迟对提升WBAN性能和健康结果至关重要，但延迟优化需要针对不同流量优先级进行定制。

Method: ADP2-MAC协议采用概率性方法动态确定信道轮询/监听间隔，识别流量到达模式以确定最优轮询间隔，并在预期紧急数据包时中断低优先级数据的传输。

Result: 与支持异构流量的MVDR协议相比，ADP2-MAC表现更优，这得益于其概率性轮询间隔和旨在高效处理紧急优先级数据的中断机制。

Conclusion: ADP2-MAC协议通过动态轮询间隔和优先级中断机制，能够有效支持无线体域网中的异构流量管理，在延迟优化方面优于现有协议。

Abstract: Efficient management of heterogeneous traffic with varying priorities is
critical in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). The priority mechanisms
embedded in Media Access Control (MAC) schemes largely govern the performance
of WBAN in terms of reliability, delay and energy efficiency. Minimizing the
delay between packet generation and reception is critical for enhancing WBAN
performance and associated health outcomes; however, delay optimization must be
tailored to each traffic priority. In this work, we proposed a novel
priority-based MAC protocol, Adaptive and Dynamic Polling MAC for Prioritized
Traffic (ADP2-MAC), designed to support heterogeneous traffic in WBANs. The
protocol utilizes a probabilistic approach to dynamically determine channel
polling/listening intervals. ADP2-MAC not only identifies traffic arrival
patterns to determine optimal polling intervals but also interrupts the
transmission of lower-priority data when urgent packets are expected. The
performance of ADP2-MAC has been compared with the MAC protocol for Variable
Data Rates (MVDR) which supports heterogeneous traffic by assigning different
data rates based on traffic priority. ADP2-MAC outperforms MVDR due to its use
of probabilistic polling intervals and an interruption mechanism designed to
efficiently handle urgent-priority data.

Conclusion: 这种混合方法保持了RFS框架固有的多目标跟踪优势，同时提高了灵活性和鲁棒性，为复杂机动目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of tracking maneuvering objects with complex
motion patterns, a task in which conventional methods often struggle due to
their reliance on predefined motion models. We integrate a data-driven liquid
neural network (LNN) into the random finite set (RFS) framework, leading to two
LNN-RFS filters. By learning continuous-time dynamics directly from data, the
LNN enables the filters to adapt to complex, nonlinear motion and achieve
accurate tracking of highly maneuvering objects in clutter. This hybrid
approach preserves the inherent multi-object tracking strengths of the RFS
framework while improving flexibility and robustness. Simulation results on
challenging maneuvering scenarios demonstrate substantial gains of the proposed
hybrid approach in tracking accuracy.

Abstract: The joint transmit and pinching beamforming design for spectral efficiency
(SE) and energy efficiency (EE) tradeoff in pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is
proposed. Both PASS-enabled single- and multi-user communications are
considered. In the single-user scenario, it is proved that the optimal pinching
antenna (PA) positions are independent of the transmit beamforming. Based on
this insight, a two-stage joint beamforming design is proposed. Specifically,
in the first stage, an iterative closed-form refinement (ICR) scheme is
proposed to align the phases of the received signals, based on which a PA
placement framework is proposed. In the second stage, the closed-form solution
for the optimal transmit beamformer is derived given the optimal PA positions.
In the multi-user scenario, an alternating optimization (AO)-based joint
beamforming design is proposed to balance the SE-EE performance while taking
the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements into account. It is proved that the
proposed AO-based algorithm is guaranteed to converge when no constraints are
violated in PA placement subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the
proposed algorithms significantly improve joint SE-EE performance with fast
convergence speed; 2) the SE-EE tradeoff regime gap between PASS and
conventional multi-antenna system widens as the number of PAs and service
coverage increase.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising solution for the
future sixth-generation (6G) system. However, classical fixed-position antenna
(FPA) ISAC systems fail to fully utilize spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs),
resulting in limited gains for both radar sensing and communication
functionalities. This challenge can be addressed by the emerging novel movable
antenna (MA) technology, which can pursue better channel conditions and improve
sensing and communication performances. In this paper, we aim to minimize the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's angle while guaranteeing
communication performance. This involves jointly optimizing active beamforming,
power allocation, receiving filters, and MA position configurations, which is a
highly non-convex problem. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an efficient
iterative solution that analytically optimizes all variables without relying on
numerical solvers, i.e., CVX. Specifically, by leveraging cutting-edge
majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) methods, we
develop a low-complexity algorithm to solve the beamformer configuration
problem containing the fractional and quartic terms. Numerical simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm,
highlighting significant performance improvements achieved by employing MA in
the ISAC system.

Abstract: This paper explores a multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink
communication system enabled by a unique transmissive reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) transceiver (TRTC) configuration. Within this system
framework, we formulate an optimization problem for the purpose of maximizing
the minimum rate of users for each cell via designing the transmit beamforming
of the TRTC, subject to the power constraints of each TRTC unit. Since the
objective function is non-differentiable, the max-min rate problem is difficult
to solve. In order to tackle this challenging optimization problem, an
efficient low-complexity optimization algorithm is developed. Specifically, the
log-form rate function is transformed into a tractable form by employing the
fractional programming (FP) methodology. Next, the max-min objective function
can be approximated using a differentiable function derived from smooth
approximation theory. Moreover, by applying the majorization-minimization (MM)
technique and examining the optimality conditions, a solution is proposed that
updates all variables analytically without relying on any numerical solvers.
Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and
effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm. Additionally, the
algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity without
performance loss. Furthermore, the simulation results illustrate the clear
superiority of the deployment of the TRTC over the benchmark schemes.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of radar-based non-contact
respiratory monitoring for wombats. Two measurement experiments were conducted
in June and December 2024 using 79-GHz millimeter-wave radar systems to monitor
the respiration of two wombats. To estimate the respiratory interval, we used a
method based on summing harmonic components in the autocorrelation function,
capturing the quasi-periodic displacement of the body surface caused by
respiration. Estimation accuracy was evaluated through simultaneous
measurements from different angles using two radar units. The respiratory
interval and respiratory rate were measured with errors of 47.4 ms (2.44%) and
0.81 bpm (2.21%), respectively. We also discuss the differences in respiratory
rates between the two wombats, as well as seasonal variations between June and
December. The results support the potential application of this method to
non-contact health monitoring of wombats.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for current and
next-generation multi-antenna systems. Yet conventional pilot-based estimators
incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow. In this paper, we address
this challenge by developing a novel framework based on Gaussian process
regression (GPR) that predicts full CSI from only a few observed entries,
thereby reducing pilot overhead. The correlation between data points in GPR is
defined by the covariance function, known as kernels. In the proposed GPR-based
CSI estimation framework, we incorporate three kernels, i.e., radial basis
function, Mat\'ern, and rational quadratic, to model smooth and multi-scale
spatial correlations derived from the antenna array geometry. The proposed
approach is evaluated across Kronecker and Weichselberger channel models with
three distinct pilot probing schemes. Results show that the proposed GPR with
50% pilot saving achieves the lowest prediction error, the highest empirical
95% credible-interval coverage, and the best preservation of mutual information
relative to benchmarks. This enables up to 50% pilot reduction while preserving
over 92% of the link capacity.

Abstract: Satellite-based communications are expected to be a substantial future market
in 6G networks. As satellite constellations grow denser and transmission
resources remain limited, frequency reuse plays an increasingly important role
in managing inter-user interference. In the multi-user downlink, precoding
enables the reuse of frequencies across spatially separated users, greatly
improving spectral efficiency. The analytical calculation of suitable
precodings for perfect channel information is well studied, however, their
performance can quickly deteriorate when faced with, e.g., outdated channel
state information or, as is particularly relevant for satellite channels, when
position estimates are erroneous. Deriving robust precoders under imperfect
channel state information is not only analytically intractable in general but
often requires substantial relaxations of the optimization problem or heuristic
constraints to obtain feasible solutions. Instead, in this paper we flexibly
derive robust precoding algorithms from given data using reinforcement
learning. We describe how we adapt the applied Soft Actor-Critic learning
algorithm to the problem of downlink satellite beamforming and show numerically
that the resulting precoding algorithm adjusts to all investigated scenarios.
The considered scenarios cover both single satellite and cooperative
multi-satellite beamforming, using either global or local channel state
information, and two error models that represent increasing levels of
uncertainty. We show that the learned algorithms match or markedly outperform
two analytical baselines in sum rate performance, adapting to the required
level of robustness. We also analyze the mechanisms that the learned algorithms
leverage to achieve robustness. The implementation is publicly available for
use and reproduction of the results.

Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication is
fundamentally reshaping the design paradigm of next-generation (NextG) systems,
where intelligent air interfaces are expected to operate adaptively and
efficiently in highly dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic
prefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency.
To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E)
transceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems.
The architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver
through joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or
time-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter
(CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead
by updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that
is scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly
reducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained
E2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional
transmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience
across diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native
NextG.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) band is considered a promising candidate to meet the
high-throughput requirement for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless
communications due to its ultrawide bandwidth. However, due to the high
penetration loss at high-frequencies, blockage becomes a serious problem in THz
communications, especially in near-field indoor communications with numerous
obstacles. To address this issue, this paper investigates blockage-resilient
near-field beam training based on self-accelerating Airy beam, which can
propagate along a curved trajectory to circumvent obstacles. Specifically, we
first analyze the trajectory of the Airy beam and the beam pattern at the
receiver using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook in the presence of
obstacles. Interestingly, we reveal that the beam pattern not only captures the
receiver's location information but also implicitly encodes the spatial
relationship between the receiver and obstacle, which facilitates identifying
the optimal Airy beam configuration. Based on this insight, we formulate the
blockage-resilient beam training task as a multitask learning problem and
propose a lightweight attention-based multi-parameter beam training network
(AMPBT-Net) to jointly predict the angle, distance, and curvature parameters of
the optimal Airy beam based on the beam pattern. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate that the Airy beam effectively mitigates blockage effects and the
proposed scheme achieves comparable performance to exhaustive beam sweeping
while significantly reducing training overhead.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a dynamic radio frequency sensing system aiming to
spatially track multiple targets over time. We develop a conditional denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (C-DDPM)-assisted framework that learns the
temporal evolution of target parameters by leveraging the noisy echo
observations as conditioning features. The proposed framework integrates a
variational autoencoder (VAE) for echo compression and utilizes classifier-free
guidance to enhance conditional denoising. In each transmission block, VAE
encodes the received echo into a latent representation that conditions DDPM to
predict future target states, which are then used for codebook beam selection.
Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms classical signal
processing, filtering, and deep learning benchmarks. The C-DDPM-assisted
framework achieves significantly lower estimation errors in both angle and
distance tracking, demonstrating the potential of generative models for
integrated sensing and communications.

estimator and quantized phase feedback. Analysis closely matches Monte Carlo
simulations and yields concrete design rules: with a surface of N=64 pixels,
pilot length $M=2N$, and pilot SNR=20 dB, the normalized mean-squared error
is0.005, implying an effective-SNR loss of about 0.5 and a capacity penalty of
0.007bits-s. Six-bit phase quantization introduces no measurable additional
penalty at these operating points, setting a practical benchmark for feedback
resolution. Training overhead scales strongly with pixel geometry: halving
pixel width (quartering pixel area) increases the pilot length required to
maintain the same NMSE by roughly fourfold. The framework reconciles
physical-optics modeling with estimation-and-feedback design and provides a
principled basis for scalable link budgeting in RIS-assisted optical networks.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler in 6G networks,
where sensing and communication capabilities are designed to complement and
enhance each other. One of the main challenges in ISAC lies in resource
allocation, which becomes computationally demanding in dynamic environments
requiring real-time adaptation. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL)-based approach for dynamic beamforming and power allocation in
ISAC systems. The DRL agent interacts with the environment and learns optimal
strategies through trial and error, guided by predefined rewards. Simulation
results show that the DRL-based solution converges within 2000 episodes and
achieves up to 80\% of the spectral efficiency of a semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) benchmark. More importantly, it offers a significant improvement in
runtime performance, achieving decision times of around 20 ms compared to 4500
ms for the SDR method. Furthermore, compared with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)
benchmark employing discrete beamforming, the proposed approach achieves
approximately 30\% higher sum-rate with comparable runtime. These results
highlight the potential of DRL for enabling real-time, high-performance ISAC in
dynamic scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业4.0应用需要检测过程中的突然变化，但测量数据通过有损无线链路传输，存在丢包和队列延迟问题，需要设计有效的快速变化检测算法。

Method: 使用伯努利采样过程，采用重传至成功的传输策略，将问题建模为马尔可夫过程，提出CUSUM算法，并考虑LCFS队列策略和多传感器调度。

Result: 证明了算法在误报率趋于零时的渐近最优性，数值分析展示了非渐近情况下的性能权衡，可用于优化系统设计参数。

Conclusion: 所提出的CUSUM算法在无线传感器网络变化检测中具有渐近最优性能，队列管理和传感器调度策略能有效降低检测延迟。

Abstract: Motivated by Industry 4.0 applications, we consider quickest change detection
(QCD) of an abrupt change in a process when its measurements are transmitted by
a sensor over a lossy wireless link to a decision maker (DM). The sensor node
samples measurements using a Bernoulli sampling process, and places the
measurement samples in the transmit queue of its transmitter. The transmitter
uses a retransmit-until-success transmission strategy to deliver packets to the
DM over the lossy link, in which the packet losses are modeled as a Bernoulli
process, with different loss probabilities before and after the change. We pose
the QCD problem in the non-Bayesian setting under Lorden's framework, and
propose a CUSUM algorithm. By defining a suitable Markov process, involving the
DM measurements and the queue length process, we show that the problem reduces
to QCD in a Markov process. Characterizing the information measure per
measurement sample at the DM, we establish the asymptotic optimality of our
algorithm when the false alarm rate tends to zero. Further, when the DM
receives incomplete data due to channel loss, we present asymptotically optimal
QCD algorithms by suitably modifying the CUSUM algorithm. We then explore the
last-come-first-served (LCFS) queuing discipline at the sensor transmit queue
to lower detection delay in the non-asymptotic case. Next, we consider the case
of multiple sensors, each with its own wireless transmitter queue, and show
that our analysis extends to the case of multiple homogeneous sensors. When the
sensors are heterogeneous, we present a sensor scheduling algorithm that
minimizes detection delay by balancing the trade-off between the age of the
observations and their information content. Numerical analysis demonstrate
trade-offs that can be used to optimize system design parameters in the
non-asymptotic regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统波反演方法通常假设少数离散均匀层，需要密集测量或对材料边界的强先验知识，这在特性连续变化的实际环境中限制了可扩展性和准确性。

Method: 使用物理信息机器学习框架，训练神经网络满足测量数据和麦克斯韦方程，将地下介电常数重建为深度的连续函数。

Result: 与现场介电常数测量结果高度一致（R^2=0.93），对细微变化敏感（Δε_r=2），在两层系统中仅需三个战略性放置的传感器即可恢复准确剖面。

Conclusion: 该方法将地下反演从边界驱动重构为连续特性估计，能够准确表征平滑介电常数变化，推动了使用低成本雷达系统的电磁成像技术发展。

Abstract: Estimating subsurface dielectric properties is essential for applications
ranging from environmental surveys of soils to nondestructive evaluation of
concrete in infrastructure. Conventional wave inversion methods typically
assume few discrete homogeneous layers and require dense measurements or strong
prior knowledge of material boundaries, limiting scalability and accuracy in
realistic settings where properties vary continuously. We present a physics
informed machine learning framework that reconstructs subsurface permittivity
as a fully neural, continuous function of depth, trained to satisfy both
measurement data and Maxwells equations. We validate the framework with both
simulations and custom built radar experiments on multilayered natural
materials. Results show close agreement with in-situ permittivity measurements
(R^2=0.93), with sensitivity to even subtle variations (Delta eps_r=2).
Parametric analysis reveals that accurate profiles can be recovered with as few
as three strategically placed sensors in two layer systems. This approach
reframes subsurface inversion from boundary-driven to continuous property
estimation, enabling accurate characterization of smooth permittivity
variations and advancing electromagnetic imaging using low cost radar systems.

Result: 成功复现了多个现有研究的实验，展示了DPFs如何解决状态空间建模中的常见挑战。

Conclusion: 该实现使可微分粒子滤波器更易于访问，促进了算法比较和应用研究。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In
the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ
particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the
hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle
filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of
the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based
optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle
filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several
recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering
differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such
differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular
PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible
to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison
between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several
existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several
common challenges with state space modelling.

Motivation: 传统相干方案需要导频进行信道估计，存在检测风险。Grassmannian信号具有噪声分布特性，可增强通信隐蔽性，适用于低检测概率通信场景。

Method: 结合直接序列扩频技术和Grassmannian信号设计非相干通信系统，利用Grassmannian星座的噪声分布特性提高隐蔽性。

Result: 仿真显示Grassmannian信号在低信噪比下提供竞争性误码率性能，相比使用QPSK或QAM调制的相干方案，在非目标接收器处具有更低的检测概率。

Conclusion: 非相干Grassmannian信号在低检测概率通信中具有实用性和安全性优势，因其改进的隐蔽性和性能表现。

Abstract: This paper proposes a noncoherent low probability of detection (LPD)
communication system based on direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and
Grassmannian signaling. Grassmannian constellations enhance covertness because
they tend to follow a noise-like distribution. Simulations showed that
Grassmannian signaling provides competitive bit error rates (BER) at low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes with low probability of detection at the
unintended receiver compared to coherent schemes that use QPSK or QAM
modulation formats and need pilots to perform channel estimation. The results
suggest the practicality and security benefits of noncoherent Grassmannian
signaling for LPD communications due to their improved covertness and
performance.

Motivation: 在线听力研究需要校准的声源，但大多数参与者缺乏专业校准设备，且其声源未校准且多样化，阻碍了高效和包容性的在线研究。

Method: 利用智能手机麦克风档案库，通过Novak等人的非同步最大长度序列算法校准计算机扬声器，通过卷积输入与脉冲响应的逆来校正扬声器。

Result: 校正后的扬声器播放平坦频谱MLS时产生近乎平坦的频谱，标准偏差小于3 dB。94个手机型号的档案库可支持美国87%和英国80%的参与者。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效和包容的在线听力研究，使缺乏专业设备的参与者也能参与校准的听力实验。

Abstract: Hearing research requires a calibrated sound source, traditionally as lab
equipment. Online research is quicker and more inclusive, but most participants
lack calibration equipment and their sound sources are uncalibrated and
diverse. This article explains how the open-source EasyEyes.app calibrates
loudspeakers online. A library of smartphone-microphone profiles allows
EasyEyes to use the participant's phone to calibrate their computer's
loudspeaker in three minutes. Participants select their phone model, which is
verified by screen size. Calibration employs the Novak et al. nonsynchronous
maximum-length-sequence (MLS) algorithm. The computer's loudspeaker is
corrected by convolving its input with the inverse of its impulse response.
Researchers can contribute to the open-access library by calibrating phones
with a measurement microphone. In the library, each profile is linked back to
the profile used to produce it, back to the manufacturer profile of a
measurement microphone. Correction accuracy is such that playing the
flat-spectrum MLS through the corrected loudspeaker produces a nearly flat
spectrum, with standard deviation less than 3 dB. A survey shows that a library
of 94 phone models from major brands will support most participants in the USA
(87%) and UK (80%). This method facilitates efficient and inclusive online
hearing research.

Motivation: 现有方法在噪声环境下训练时往往像去噪任务，抑制噪声信息导致泛化能力下降；而冻结的自监督学习编码器虽然避免此问题，但在混合声音嵌入偏离干净源嵌入时性能下降。

Method: 采用保留而非去噪策略，结合多标签音频分类损失和混合对齐损失，将学生混合嵌入与干净和噪声输入的教师嵌入凸组合对齐。

Conclusion: 提出的策略能更好地保留混合声源信息，在异常声音检测任务中展现出改进的分布偏移鲁棒性。

Abstract: Anomalous sound detection (ASD) in the wild requires robustness to
distribution shifts such as unseen low-SNR input mixtures of machine and noise
types. State-of-the-art systems extract embeddings from an adapted audio
encoder and detect anomalies via nearest-neighbor search, but fine tuning on
noisy machine sounds often acts like a denoising objective, suppressing noise
and reducing generalization under mismatched mixtures or inconsistent labeling.
Training-free systems with frozen self-supervised learning (SSL) encoders avoid
this issue and show strong first-shot generalization, yet their performance
drops when mixture embeddings deviate from clean-source embeddings. We propose
to improve SSL backbones with a retain-not-denoise strategy that better
preserves information from mixed sound sources. The approach combines a
multi-label audio tagging loss with a mixture alignment loss that aligns
student mixture embeddings to convex teacher embeddings of clean and noise
inputs. Controlled experiments on stationary, non-stationary, and mismatched
noise subsets demonstrate improved robustness under distribution shifts,
narrowing the gap toward oracle mixture representations.

Motivation: 研究动机是区分外周听力损失和高级认知处理对老年人言语可懂度的相对贡献，这对于理解老年人听力障碍的本质和改进助听技术具有重要意义。

Method: 采用对比实验方法：对年轻正常听力者使用WHIS模拟器模拟老年听力损失，对老年听力损失者进行实际测试，并使用GESI客观测量工具预测言语可懂度得分。

Result: 结果显示部分老年听力损失者的言语可懂度得分高于年轻正常听力者平均值，表明其高级处理过程可能更有效；GESI能够较准确地预测两组人群的得分。

Conclusion: WHIS和GESI工具能够促进不同听力水平人群的对比实验，有助于单独研究老年听力损失者高级处理过程的影响，为个性化听力康复提供支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for separating the effects of peripheral
hearing loss (HL) and higher-level processes on speech intelligibility (SI). In
a previous study, we conducted an SI experiment with 14 older adult (OA)
listeners, using speech-in-noise sounds that were either processed with an
ideal ratio mask (IRM) enhancement technique or left unprocessed. The current
study involved an SI experiment with 15 young, normal-hearing (YNH) listeners.
This experiment used simulated HL sounds processed with the WHIS simulator that
reflected the hearing level of a specific OA from the previous study. The
results showed that the target OA's SI scores were higher than the average YNH
scores. This implies that the target OA's higher-level processes may be more
effective than those of the average YNH. To understand the characteristics of
other OAs, we used the GESI objective intelligibility measure to predict SI.
First, we confirmed that GESI could fairly accurately predict the SI scores for
both the YNH and OA listeners. Next, we predicted the SI scores of the 14 OA
listeners using the parameters estimated in the YNH experiment. The results
showed that some OAs had higher SI scores than the average YNH, while one OA
had lower scores. These differences in SI scores may reflect variations in the
efficiency of higher-level processes.These results imply that WHIS and GESI
could facilitate contrastive experiments between YNH and OA listeners,
regardless of hearing level. This would allow us to study the effects of
higher-level processes in OA listeners individually.

Motivation: 开发一个能够明确控制音高同时保持高质量音频的神经音频编解码器，为解耦其他语音属性提供简单可扩展的框架。

Method: 在训练期间对F0轮廓进行平坦化和随机偏移，同时将真实F0作为条件输入；使用向量量化瓶颈防止音高恢复；采用基于流的解码器生成高质量音频。

Result: PitchFlower在音高控制准确性上优于WORLD，音频质量更高；在可控性上优于SiFiGAN，同时保持相当的音频质量。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅实现了音高的有效解耦和控制，还为解耦其他语音属性提供了简单可扩展的路径。

Abstract: We present PitchFlower, a flow-based neural audio codec with explicit pitch
controllability. Our approach enforces disentanglement through a simple
perturbation: during training, F0 contours are flattened and randomly shifted,
while the true F0 is provided as conditioning. A vector-quantization bottleneck
prevents pitch recovery, and a flow-based decoder generates high quality audio.
Experiments show that PitchFlower achieves more accurate pitch control than
WORLD at much higher audio quality, and outperforms SiFiGAN in controllability
while maintaining comparable quality. Beyond pitch, this framework provides a
simple and extensible path toward disentangling other speech attributes.

Conclusion: 该工作为理解语音基础模型如何处理语音中的副语言特征提供了新的评估方法和数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech foundation models (SFMs) have enabled the direct
processing of spoken language from raw audio, bypassing intermediate textual
representations. This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially
respond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal.
One under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality,
encompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation
types are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and
social meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely
rely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to
failure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic
features influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through
open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether
model behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce
a new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality,
designed to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work
provides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular
non-lexical aspects of speech perception.

Conclusion: MultiConvAdapter是一种有效的参数高效微调解决方案，能够以极少的可训练参数实现优异的合成语音检测性能。

Abstract: Recent synthetic speech detection models typically adapt a pre-trained SSL
model via finetuning, which is computationally demanding. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative. However, existing methods lack the
specific inductive biases required to model the multi-scale temporal artifacts
characteristic of spoofed audio. This paper introduces the Multi-Scale
Convolutional Adapter (MultiConvAdapter), a parameter-efficient architecture
designed to address this limitation. MultiConvAdapter integrates parallel
convolutional modules within the SSL encoder, facilitating the simultaneous
learning of discriminative features across multiple temporal resolutions,
capturing both short-term artifacts and long-term distortions. With only
$3.17$M trainable parameters ($1\%$ of the SSL backbone), MultiConvAdapter
substantially reduces the computational burden of adaptation. Evaluations on
five public datasets, demonstrate that MultiConvAdapter achieves superior
performance compared to full fine-tuning and established PEFT methods.

Abstract: Annotating time boundaries of sound events is labor-intensive, limiting the
scalability of strongly supervised learning in audio detection. To reduce
annotation costs, weakly-supervised learning with only clip-level labels has
been widely adopted. As an alternative, partial label learning offers a
cost-effective approach, where a set of possible labels is provided instead of
exact weak annotations. However, partial label learning for audio analysis
remains largely unexplored. Motivated by the observation that acoustic scenes
provide contextual information for constructing a set of possible sound events,
we utilize acoustic scene information to construct partial labels of sound
events. On the basis of this idea, in this paper, we propose a multitask
learning framework that jointly performs acoustic scene classification and
sound event detection with partial labels of sound events. While reducing
annotation costs, weakly-supervised and partial label learning often suffer
from decreased detection performance due to lacking the precise event set and
their temporal annotations. To better balance between annotation cost and
detection performance, we also explore a semi-supervised framework that
leverages both strong and partial labels. Moreover, to refine partial labels
and achieve better model training, we propose a label refinement method based
on self-distillation for the proposed approach with partial labels.

Conclusion: 该框架为高质量、引擎无关的多语言TTS建立了模块化基准，并提出了可懂度、自然度和用户偏好的评估策略。

Abstract: Intra-sentence multilingual speech synthesis (code-switching TTS) remains a
major challenge due to abrupt language shifts, varied scripts, and mismatched
prosody between languages. Conventional TTS systems are typically monolingual
and fail to produce natural, intelligible speech in mixed-language contexts. We
introduce Script-First Multilingual Synthesis with Adaptive Locale Resolution
(SFMS-ALR), an engine-agnostic framework for fluent, real-time code-switched
speech generation. SFMS-ALR segments input text by Unicode script, applies
adaptive language identification to determine each segment's language and
locale, and normalizes prosody using sentiment-aware adjustments to preserve
expressive continuity across languages. The algorithm generates a unified SSML
representation with appropriate "lang" or "voice" spans and synthesizes the
utterance in a single TTS request. Unlike end-to-end multilingual models,
SFMS-ALR requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with existing voices
from Google, Apple, Amazon, and other providers. Comparative analysis with
data-driven pipelines such as Unicom and Mask LID demonstrates SFMS-ALR's
flexibility, interpretability, and immediate deployability. The framework
establishes a modular baseline for high-quality, engine-independent
multilingual TTS and outlines evaluation strategies for intelligibility,
naturalness, and user preference.

to generate and playback eight-channel sound in real-time, creating an
immersive auditory experience over the course of a three-month exhibition. The
work is grounded in the concept of a "new form of archive," which aims to
preserve the artistic style of an artist while expanding beyond artists' past
artworks by continued generation of new sound elements. This speculative
approach to archival preservation is facilitated by training the AI model on a
dataset consisting of over 200 hours of Evala's past sound artworks.
  By addressing key requirements in the co-creation of art using AI, this study
highlights the value of the following aspects: (1) the necessity of integrating
artist feedback, (2) datasets derived from an artist's past works, and (3)
ensuring the inclusion of unexpected, novel outputs. In Studies for, the model
was designed to reflect the artist's artistic identity while generating new,
previously unheard sounds, making it a fitting realization of the concept of "a
new form of archive." We propose a Human-AI co-creation framework for
effectively incorporating sound generation AI models into the sound art
creation process and suggest new possibilities for creating and archiving sound
art that extend an artist's work beyond their physical existence. Demo page:

### [41] [Controlling Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning with Knowledge-Driven Multiple Hypothesis: Application to Beat Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25560)
*Antonin Gagnere,Slim Essid,Geoffroy Peeters*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出一种对比自监督预训练方法，利用数据中多个可能的正样本假设来处理音乐节拍跟踪中的歧义问题，通过基于知识的评分函数选择最合理的假设，在微调后优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据和问题约束中的歧义可能导致机器学习任务产生多个同样合理的结果，例如在节拍跟踪中不同听众可能有不同的节奏解释，这些解释都不一定是错误的。

Method: 采用对比自监督预训练方法，学习与不同假设兼容的表示，使用基于知识的评分函数选择最合理的假设。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，微调后的模型优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 将领域知识与多假设选择相结合在音乐表示学习中具有优势。

Abstract: Ambiguities in data and problem constraints can lead to diverse, equally
plausible outcomes for a machine learning task. In beat and downbeat tracking,
for instance, different listeners may adopt various rhythmic interpretations,
none of which would necessarily be incorrect. To address this, we propose a
contrastive self-supervised pre-training approach that leverages multiple
hypotheses about possible positive samples in the data. Our model is trained to
learn representations compatible with different such hypotheses, which are
selected with a knowledge-based scoring function to retain the most plausible
ones. When fine-tuned on labeled data, our model outperforms existing methods
on standard benchmarks, showcasing the advantages of integrating domain
knowledge with multi-hypothesis selection in music representation learning in
particular.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Binaspect是一个开源的Python库，用于双耳音频分析、可视化和特征生成，通过生成可解释的方位图来显示双耳线索的退化情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个无需先验头部模型知识的工具，使研究人员和工程师能够观察双耳线索如何被编解码器和渲染器设计选择等下游过程所退化。

Method: 通过计算修改的耳间时间和电平差频谱图，并将时频(TF)箱聚类为稳定的时-方位直方图表示，生成可解释的方位图。

Result: 该工具在比特率阶梯、Ambisonic渲染和VBAP源定位等场景中清晰显示了退化情况，多个活动源表现为不同的方位聚类，而退化表现为分布变宽、扩散或偏移。

Conclusion: Binaspect不仅具有诊断价值，其表示还可以导出为结构化特征，适用于质量预测、空间音频分类等机器学习模型的训练，并以开源许可证发布。

Abstract: We present Binaspect, an open-source Python library for binaural audio
analysis, visualization, and feature generation. Binaspect generates
interpretable "azimuth maps" by calculating modified interaural time and level
difference spectrograms, and clustering those time-frequency (TF) bins into
stable time-azimuth histogram representations. This allows multiple active
sources to appear as distinct azimuthal clusters, while degradations manifest
as broadened, diffused, or shifted distributions. Crucially, Binaspect operates
blindly on audio, requiring no prior knowledge of head models. These
visualizations enable researchers and engineers to observe how binaural cues
are degraded by codec and renderer design choices, among other downstream
processes. We demonstrate the tool on bitrate ladders, ambisonic rendering, and
VBAP source positioning, where degradations are clearly revealed. In addition
to their diagnostic value, the proposed representations can be exported as
structured features suitable for training machine learning models in quality
prediction, spatial audio classification, and other binaural tasks. Binaspect
is released under an open-source license with full reproducibility scripts at

### [43] [Efficient Vocal Source Separation Through Windowed Sink Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25745)
*Christodoulos Benetatos,Yongyi Zang,Randal Leistikow*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 通过用窗口化注意力机制替代全时域注意力，在保持92%原始性能的同时将计算量减少44.5倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音分离模型使用全时域自注意力机制，计算成本随音频长度呈二次方增长，需要更高效的注意力机制

Method: 分析预训练模型发现注意力模式高度局部化，使用窗口化注意力配合注意力sink机制替代全注意力

Result: 从原始检查点微调后恢复92%的原始SDR性能，同时FLOPs减少44.5倍

Conclusion: 窗口化注意力机制能显著降低计算成本而保持性能，为长音频处理提供高效解决方案

Abstract: State-of-the-art vocal separation models like Mel-Band-Roformer rely on full
temporal self-attention mechanisms, where each temporal frame interacts with
every other frames. This incurs heavy computational costs that scales
quadratically with input audio length, motivating chunking and windowing
approaches. Through analysis of a pre-trained vocal separation model, we
discovered that temporal attention patterns are highly localized. Building on
this insight, we replaced full attention with windowed sink attention (WSA)
with small temporal attention window and attention sinks. We show empirically
that fine-tuning from the original checkpoint recovers 92% of the original SDR
performance while reducing FLOPs by 44.5x. We release our code and checkpoints
under MIT license at https://github.com/smulelabs/windowed-roformer.

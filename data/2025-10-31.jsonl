However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely\non computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental\ninterference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided\nand light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength\nindicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically\ninterpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce\nthe model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to\nenvironmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our\nmodel reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under\nconventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the\nprevious benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance\nis achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a\nMobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions. The\ncombination of high accuracy, robustness to interference, and computational\nefficiency makes our framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device\ndeployment in edge devices, paving the way for more intelligent and reliable\nwireless communication systems."}

To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard,\nthe first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that\nsafety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to\nidentify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as\ntriggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference\ntime.

### [1] [Reading Radio from Camera: Visually-Grounded, Lightweight, and Interpretable RSSI Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25936)
*Sen Yan,Tianyu Hu,Brahim Mefgouda,Samson Lasaulce,Merouane Debbah*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理引导的轻量级框架，通过摄像头图像预测无线信号强度，将RSSI分解为路径损耗和阴影衰落，显著提升了预测精度和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的无线信号预测方法计算量大且对环境干扰敏感，需要一种更轻量、更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 将RSSI分解为路径损耗和阴影衰落两个物理可解释分量，使用基于MobileNet的轻量模型进行预测。

Result: 在常规条件下将预测RMSE降低了50.3%，在干扰消除条件下仍比之前基准低11.5%的RMSE，模型尺寸比竞品小19倍。

Conclusion: 该框架结合了高精度、抗干扰性和计算效率，非常适合在边缘设备上进行实时部署，为更智能可靠的无线通信系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate, real-time wireless signal prediction is essential for
next-generation networks. However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely
on computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental
interference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided
and light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength
indicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically
interpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce
the model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach
establishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to
environmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our
model reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under
conventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the
previous benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance
is achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a
MobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions. The
combination of high accuracy, robustness to interference, and computational
efficiency makes our framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device
deployment in edge devices, paving the way for more intelligent and reliable
wireless communication systems.

### [2] [Lightweight Ac Arc Fault Diagnosis via Fourier Transform Inspired Multi-frequency Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26093)
*Qianchao Wang,Chuanzhen Jia,Yuxuan Ding,Zhe Li,Yaping Du*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MFNN的多频神经网络，通过嵌入物理知识和自适应激活函数EAS，在资源受限条件下实现串联电弧故障的轻量级在线检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电弧故障诊断方法在资源受限条件下难以同时实现快速响应和鲁棒准确性，需要开发更有效的检测技术来预防电气火灾。

Method: 基于电弧电流曲线和傅里叶分解分析，设计了具有超强表达能力的自适应激活函数EAS，并构建了带有分支网络的新型网络架构，帮助MFNN提取多频特征。

Result: 在多个采样时间和多级噪声的实验数据集上，MFNN在电弧故障定位方面优于其他8种先进模型，在SNR=-9时测试准确率比LCNN高14.51%，比BLS高16.3%。

Conclusion: EAS激活函数和网络架构共同贡献了MFNN的优异性能，使其在噪声免疫性和故障定位精度方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Lightweight online detection of series arc faults is critically needed in
residential and industrial power systems to prevent electrical fires. Existing
diagnostic methods struggle to achieve both rapid response and robust accuracy
under resource-constrained conditions. To overcome the challenge, this work
suggests leveraging a multi-frequency neural network named MFNN, embedding
prior physical knowledge into the network. Inspired by arcing current curve and
the Fourier decomposition analysis, we create an adaptive activation function
with super-expressiveness, termed EAS, and a novel network architecture with
branch networks to help MFNN extract features with multiple frequencies. In our
experiments, eight advanced arc fault diagnosis models across an experimental
dataset with multiple sampling times and multi-level noise are used to
demonstrate the superiority of MFNN. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The
MFNN outperforms other models in arc fault location, befitting from signal
decomposition of branch networks. 2) The noise immunity of MFNN is much better
than that of other models, achieving 14.51% over LCNN and 16.3% over BLS in
test accuracy when SNR=-9. 3) EAS and the network architecture contribute to
the excellent performance of MFNN.

### [3] [Robust Super-Capacity SRS Channel Inpainting via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26097)
*Usman Akram,Fan Zhang,Yang Li,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散模型的信道修复框架，通过似然梯度项整合系统模型知识，使单一训练模型能够适应不匹配条件，在5G NR系统中实现鲁棒和可泛化的超容量SRS设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G NR中基于互易性的波束成形面临资源和覆盖限制，需要稀疏非均匀SRS分配。现有MAE方法在训练掩码上过拟合，在未见失真下性能下降。

Method: 使用基于扩散的信道修复框架，在推理时通过似然梯度项整合系统模型知识，采用基于分数的扩散变体。

Result: 在标准化CDL信道上，基于分数的扩散变体在分布偏移下持续优于UNet基线，在挑战性设置下NMSE提升达14dB，同时在匹配条件下保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 扩散引导的修复是5G NR系统中鲁棒且可泛化的超容量SRS设计方法。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for reliable multiuser
MIMO operation. In 5G NR, reciprocity-based beamforming via uplink Sounding
Reference Signals (SRS) face resource and coverage constraints, motivating
sparse non-uniform SRS allocation. Prior masked-autoencoder (MAE) approaches
improve coverage but overfit to training masks and degrade under unseen
distortions (e.g., additional masking, interference, clipping, non-Gaussian
noise). We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that
integrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term,
enabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On
standardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently
outperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution
shift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g.,
Laplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under
matched conditions. These results demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting
is a robust and generalizable approach for super-capacity SRS design in 5G NR
systems.

### [4] [Virtual-Real Collaborated Split Learning via Model Partitioning in IRS-Assisted IoT Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26150)
*Jiaying Di,Kunlun Wang,Jing Xu,Wen Chen,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种智能反射面辅助的数字孪生物联网网络中大规模分割学习的计算与通信协同设计框架，通过优化层分割点、DT分配决策、IRS相位矩阵等关键变量，显著降低端到端训练延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IRS辅助的IoT网络中，用户设备计算能力异构且通信资源受限，传统分割学习面临延迟挑战。数字孪生技术可以替代计算能力不足的设备参与训练，但需要协同优化计算与通信资源。

Method: 采用交替优化方法，结合闭式更新、半定松弛和低复杂度启发式算法，联合优化层分割点、DT分配、IRS相位矩阵、AP功率分配和DT频率调整五个关键变量。

Result: 仿真表明，所提方案相比传统基线显著降低训练延迟，在高用户密度和严格功率约束下可实现高达35%的延迟改善。

Conclusion: 该计算通信协同设计框架有效解决了IRS辅助DT-IoT网络中分割学习的延迟优化问题，为大规模异构设备协同训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel computation and communication co-design
framework for large-scale split learning in intelligent reflecting surface
(IRS)-assisted internet of things (IoT) networks integrated with digital twin
(DT) technique. The considered system consists of a multi-antenna access point
(AP), multiple heterogeneous user devices (UDs), and an deployed IRS to enhance
both uplink and downlink transmission. The training process of a deep neural
network is partitioned between devices and the AP, where a DT replica is
activated to replace UDs with insufficient local computation capabilities. We
formulate a delay-optimal split learning problem, which optimizes five key
variables: layer partitioning points, DT assignment decisions, IRS phase shift
matrix, AP downlink power allocation, and DT frequency adjustment, aiming to
minimize the overall end-to-end delay under communication and computation. The
proposed optimization problem is a highly coupled non-convex mixed-integer
problem. Therefore, we solve using an alternating optimization approach
combining closed-form updates, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and
low-complexity heuristics. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
scheme significantly reduces training delay compared to conventional baselines
and achieves up to 35\% delay improvement, especially under high UD density and
stringent power constraints.

### [5] [6D Channel Knowledge Map Construction via Bidirectional Wireless Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26166)
*Juncong Zhou,Chao Hu,Guanlin Wu,Zixiang Ren,Han Hu,Juyong Zhang,Rui Zhang,Jie Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为双向无线高斯溅射(BiWGS)的六维信道知识图谱框架，能够建模3D空间中动态发射器和接收器位置的无线信道，相比传统方法实现了维度扩展且不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D/3D信道知识图谱方法假设基站配置固定，无法处理动态变化的发射器和接收器位置。需要开发能建模6D空间(包含动态Tx和Rx位置)的信道知识图谱框架。

Method: 使用高斯椭球体表示无线环境中的虚拟散射簇和环境障碍物。通过学习双向散射模式和复杂衰减特性，这些椭球体能够捕获无线环境的电磁传输特性，准确建模不同收发器配置下的信号传输。

Result: BiWGS在构建6D信道功率增益图谱方面显著优于经典多层感知器(MLP)，在3D信道知识图谱构建方面实现了与最先进的无线辐射场高斯溅射(WRF-GS)相当的空间频谱预测精度。

Conclusion: BiWGS成功实现了6D信道知识图谱构建的维度扩展，同时保持了高保真度，验证了该方法在动态无线环境建模中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the construction of channel knowledge map (CKM) from
sparse channel measurements. Dif ferent from conventional
two-/three-dimensional (2D/3D) CKM approaches assuming fixed base station
configurations, we present a six-dimensional (6D) CKM framework named
bidirectional wireless Gaussian splatting (BiWGS), which is capable of mod
eling wireless channels across dynamic transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx)
positions in 3D space. BiWGS uses Gaussian el lipsoids to represent virtual
scatterer clusters and environmental obstacles in the wireless environment. By
properly learning the bidirectional scattering patterns and complex attenuation
profiles based on channel measurements, these ellipsoids inherently cap ture
the electromagnetic transmission characteristics of wireless environments,
thereby accurately modeling signal transmission under varying transceiver
configurations. Experiment results show that BiWGS significantly outperforms
classic multi-layer perception (MLP) for the construction of 6D channel power
gain map with varying Tx-Rx positions, and achieves spatial spectrum prediction
accuracy comparable to the state-of-the art wireless radiation field Gaussian
splatting (WRF-GS) for 3D CKM construction. This validates the capability of
the proposed BiWGS in accomplishing dimensional expansion of 6D CKM
construction, without compromising fidelity.

### [6] [Design of Orthogonal Phase of Arrival Positioning Scheme Based on 5G PRS and Optimization of TOA Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26245)
*Juyeop Kim,Hyejin Shin,Sohee Kim,Ilmu Byun*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在5G网络中，终端位置通过基站发送的定位参考信号的到达时间来确定，需要解决低采样率约束下的TOA精度问题

Method: 提出改进TOA精度的算法，在软件定义调制解调器中实现5G PRS定位，并研究PRS时频资源分配对TOA估计的影响

Result: 实现了在软件定义调制解调器中的5G PRS定位，分析了不同PRS配置对TOA估计精度的影响

Conclusion: 讨论了针对给定信号环境的最优PRS配置，为5G定位系统的优化提供了指导

Abstract: This study analyzes the performance of positioning techniques based on
configuration changes of 5G New Radio signals. In 5G networks, a terminal
position is determined from the Time of Arrival of Positioning Reference
Signals transmitted by base stations. We propose an algorithm that improves TOA
accuracy under low sampling rate constraints and implement 5G PRS for
positioning in a software defined modem. We also examine how flexible time
frequency resource allocation of PRS affects TOA estimation accuracy and
discuss optimal PRS configurations for a given signal environment.

### [7] [Optimal transmit field distribution for partially obstructed continuous radiating surfaces in near-field communication systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26262)
*Francesco Verde,Donatella Darsena,Marco Di Renzo,Vincenzo Galdi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在遮挡环境下优化合成孔径场的方法，用于近场通信中的能量聚焦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在遮挡环境下的近场通信中，需要解决能量传输效率低的问题，通过物理一致的建模来优化孔径场合成。

Method: 使用基于刀边衍射的物理模型，将问题表述为希尔伯特空间中的最大化问题，获得匹配滤波器形式的优化解。

Result: 得到了一个匹配衍射诱导核形状的优化滤波器，将波传播与信号处理方法联系起来。

Conclusion: 该框架通过物理建模、信号处理和硬件设计的结合，实现了遮挡近场信道中高效的能量聚焦。

Abstract: This paper deals with the optimal synthesis of aperture fields for
(radiating) near-field communications in obstructed environments. A physically
consistent model based on knife-edge diffraction is used to formulate the
problem as a maximization in Hilbert space. The optimal solution is obtained as
a matched filter that ``matches" the shape of a diffraction-induced kernel,
thus linking wave propagation with signal processing methods. The framework
supports hardware implementation using continuous apertures such as
metasurfaces or lens antennas. This approach bridges physically grounded
modeling, signal processing, and hardware design for efficient energy focusing
in near-field obstructed channels.

### [8] [SABER: Symbolic Regression-based Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26340)
*Shih-Kai Chou,Mengran Zhao,Cheng-Nan Hu,Kuang-Chung Chou,Carolina Fortuna,Jernej Hribar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出SABER框架，使用符号回归自动发现可解释的波束模式和到达角模型，在真实环境中实现高精度估计，是黑盒机器学习方法的可解释替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高分辨率技术需要多天线阵列和大量数据采集，而通用机器学习方法缺乏物理可解释性，需要开发既准确又可解释的到达角估计方法。

Method: 采用约束符号回归框架，从路径损耗测量中自动发现闭式波束模式和到达角模型，在无回声室和RIS辅助室内测试平台验证。

Result: 在控制环境中实现低于0.5度的平均绝对误差，在真实环境中实现接近零误差的到达角恢复，性能接近克拉美罗下界。

Conclusion: SABER框架在保持高精度的同时提供了物理可解释性，是到达角估计中黑盒机器学习方法的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation
wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision
localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution
techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,
while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models
that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a
Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based
Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained
symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam
pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER
achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and
interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a
controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of
the known $\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5
degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further
reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that
lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a
real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.
SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with
near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\'er-Rao Lower
Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and
accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA
estimation.

### [9] [HMM for short independent sequences: Multiple sequence Baum-Welch application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26532)
*Margarita Cabrera-Bean,Josep Vidal,Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin,Albert Roso-Llorach,Concepcion Violan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对多独立短序列数据的隐马尔可夫模型训练和解码的伪代码实现，特别适用于人口健康纵向研究中个体轨迹数据的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMM训练依赖单个长观测序列，但在人口健康等纵向研究中，数据通常由多个个体的短时间序列组成，需要专门的处理方法。

Method: 基于EM算法的Baum-Welch算法，针对多独立短序列场景进行改进，提供相应的训练和解码伪代码实现。

Result: 开发了适用于多短序列数据的HMM训练和解码算法框架，能够有效处理人口健康纵向研究中的个体轨迹数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理多独立短序列数据的HMM应用提供了实用解决方案，特别适用于人口健康等领域的纵向研究。

Abstract: In the classical setting, the training of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
typically relies on a single, sufficiently long observation sequence that can
be regarded as representative of the underlying stochastic process. In this
context, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied in its
specialized form for HMMs, namely the Baum Welch algorithm, which has been
extensively employed in applications such as speech recognition. The objective
of this work is to present pseudocode formulations for both the training and
decoding procedures of HMMs in a different scenario, where the available data
consist of multiple independent temporal sequences generated by the same model,
each of relatively short duration, i.e., containing only a limited number of
samples. Special emphasis is placed on the relevance of this formulation to
longitudinal studies in population health, where datasets are naturally
structured as collections of short trajectories across individuals with point
data at follow up.

### [10] [Statistically Adaptive Differential Protection for AC Microgrids Based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26604)
*Shahab Moradi Torkashvand,Arina Kharazi,Emad Sadeghi,Seyed Hossein Hesamedin Sadeghi,Adel Nasiri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于Kullback-Leibler散度的统计自适应差动保护方案，使用Bartlett校正G统计量对对数变换电流幅值进行计算，实现微电网故障检测与分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆变器资源的普及给传统微电网保护带来挑战，因为引入了可变故障电流和复杂瞬态过程。

Method: 采用多元故障检测引擎，使用马氏距离区分健康与故障状态，检测阈值基于卡方分布统计推导，故障类型识别通过轻量级分类器评估每相G统计量，并使用时序持久性滤波器增强安全性。

Result: 在改进的CIGRE 14总线微电网上进行广泛仿真，显示亚周期平均检测延迟、高检测和分类精度、对高达250欧姆高阻抗故障的弹性、对10ms通信延迟的容忍度，以及低至20dB信噪比的噪声水平。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代交流微电网保护提供了可重现且计算效率高的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of inverter-based resources challenges traditional
microgrid protection by introducing variable fault currents and complex
transients. This paper presents a statistically adaptive differential
protection scheme based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, implemented via a
Bartlett-corrected G-statistic computed on logarithm-transformed current
magnitudes. The method is a multivariate fault detection engine that employs
the Mahalanobis distance to distinguish healthy and faulty states, enabling
robust detection even in noisy environments. Detection thresholds are
statistically derived from a chi-squared distribution for precise control over
the false alarm rate. Upon detection, a lightweight classifier identifies the
fault type by assessing per-phase G-statistics against dedicated thresholds,
enhanced by a temporal persistence filter for security. Extensive simulations
on a modified CIGRE 14-bus microgrid show high efficacy: sub-cycle average
detection delays, high detection and classification accuracy across operating
modes, resilience to high-impedance faults up to 250 Ohms, tolerance to 10 ms
communication delay, and noise levels down to a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio.
These findings demonstrate a reproducible and computationally efficient
solution for next-generation AC microgrid protection.

### [11] [Graph Guided Modulo Recovery of EEG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26756)
*Soujanya Hazra,Sanjay Ghosh*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出GraphUnwrapNet，一种基于图神经网络的EEG信号模数恢复方法，通过图结构表示EEG通道间的时间依赖性，引入预估计引导的特征注入模块来增强恢复稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号存在显著的个体间变异性，容易导致信号失真或削波。模数采样通过折叠信号而非饱和来解决此问题，但从折叠观测中恢复原始波形是一个高度不适定问题。

Method: 将EEG信号表示为有组织的图结构，通道和时间连接建立底层相互依赖关系。引入预估计引导的特征注入模块，提供粗略的折叠指示器以增强在包裹边界处的恢复稳定性。

Result: 在STEW数据集上的综合实验表明，相比传统优化技术有持续改进，与当前深度学习模型相比具有竞争性的准确度。

Conclusion: 基于图的方法在稳健的模数EEG恢复方面具有潜力，将结构信息与折叠先验集成到统一框架中。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) often shows significant variability among
people. This fluctuation disrupts reliable acquisition and may result in
distortion or clipping. Modulo sampling is now a promising solution to this
problem, by folding signals instead of saturating them. Recovery of the
original waveform from folded observations is a highly ill-posed problem. In
this work, we propose a method based on a graph neural network, referred to as
GraphUnwrapNet, for the modulo recovery of EEG signals. Our core idea is to
represent an EEG signal as an organized graph whose channels and temporal
connections establish underlying interdependence. One of our key contributions
is in introducing a pre-estimation guided feature injection module to provide
coarse folding indicators that enhance stability during recovery at wrap
boundaries. This design integrates structural information with folding priors
into an integrated framework. We performed comprehensive experiments on the
Simultaneous Task EEG Workload (STEW) dataset. The results demonstrate
consistent enhancements over traditional optimization techniques and
competitive accuracy relative to current deep learning models. Our findings
emphasize the potential of graph-based methodology for robust modulo EEG
recovery.

### [12] [SPEAR: A Unified SSL Framework for Learning Speech and Audio Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25955)
*Xiaoyu Yang,Yifan Yang,Zengrui Jin,Ziyun Cui,Wen Wu,Baoxiang Li,Chao Zhang,Phil Woodland*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: SPEAR是首个成功从语音和音频混合数据中学习统一表示的自监督学习框架，通过掩码预测细粒度离散token的统一预训练目标，在语音和通用音频领域都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法都是领域特定的，要么针对语音，要么针对通用音频，阻碍了开发具有全面能力的统一表示模型。

Method: 提出基于掩码预测细粒度离散token的统一预训练目标，使用多码本向量量化方法从连续表示中提取token，保留丰富的声学细节。

Result: 语音领域模型在SUPERB基准测试中达到新SOTA，在15个任务中12个匹配或超越WavLM Large；统一模型在SUPERB和HEAR两个基准测试中展现全面能力；600M参数模型在两个领域都表现出色。

Conclusion: SPEAR成功实现了语音和音频的统一表示学习，建立了最强大和通用的开源自监督学习模型之一。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) excels at learning generic representations of
acoustic signals, yet prevailing methods remain domain-specific, tailored to
either speech or general audio, hindering the development of a unified
representation model with a comprehensive capability over both domains. To
address this, we present SPEAR (SPEech and Audio Representations), the first
SSL framework to successfully learn unified speech and audio representations
from a mixture of speech and audio data. SPEAR proposes a unified pre-training
objective based on masked prediction of fine-grained discrete tokens for both
speech and general audio. These tokens are derived from continuous speech and
audio representations using a Multi-codebook Vector Quantisation (MVQ) method,
retaining rich acoustic detail essential for modelling both speech and complex
audio events. SPEAR is applied to pre-train both single-domain and unified
speech-and-audio SSL models. Our speech-domain model establishes a new
state-of-the-art on the SUPERB benchmark, a speech processing benchmark for SSL
models, matching or surpassing the highly competitive WavLM Large on 12 out of
15 tasks with the same pre-training corpora and a similar model size.
Crucially, our unified model learns complementary features and demonstrates
comprehensive capabilities across two major benchmarks, SUPERB and HEAR, for
evaluating audio representations. By further scaling up the model size and
pre-training data, we present a unified model with 600M parameters that excels
in both domains, establishing it as one of the most powerful and versatile
open-source SSL models for auditory understanding. The inference code and
pre-trained models will be made publicly available.

### [13] [ALMGuard: Safety Shortcuts and Where to Find Them as Guardrails for Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26096)
*Weifei Jin,Yuxin Cao,Junjie Su,Minhui Xue,Jie Hao,Ke Xu,Jin Song Dong,Derui Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: ALMGuard是首个针对音频语言模型的防御框架，通过识别通用捷径激活扰动来激活模型的安全捷径，有效防御ALM特定的越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频语言模型引入了新的漏洞向量，现有从传统音频对抗攻击或文本LLM越狱防御直接迁移的方法对ALM特定威胁效果不佳。

Method: 基于安全对齐捷径自然存在于ALMs中的假设，设计识别通用捷径激活扰动的方法，并进一步提出Mel梯度稀疏掩码来筛选有效触发因素。

Result: 将先进ALM特定越狱攻击的平均成功率降至4.6%，同时在良性基准测试上保持相当的实用性。

Conclusion: ALMGuard在理论和实证上都证明了其对已知和未知攻击的鲁棒性，成为该领域的新最先进技术。

Abstract: Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved
multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio
modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies
have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that
defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective
against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard,
the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that
safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to
identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as
triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference
time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's
utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM),
which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to
jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both
seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate
of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while
maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new
state of the art. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/WeifeiJin/ALMGuard.

### [14] [SP-MCQA: Evaluating Intelligibility of TTS Beyond the Word Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26190)
*Hitomi Jin Ling Tee,Chaoren Wang,Zijie Zhang,Zhizheng Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了SP-MCQA评估方法，通过口语段落多选题问答来评估合成语音中关键信息的准确性，发现低WER并不保证高关键信息准确率，揭示了传统指标与实际可懂度之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS可懂度评估过度依赖词级准确率指标如WER，无法捕捉真实世界语音的复杂性或反映人类理解需求，需要更贴近实际的高层次评估标准。

Method: 提出口语段落多选题问答(SP-MCQA)主观评估方法，并发布了8.76小时新闻风格的SP-MCQA-Eval基准数据集。

Result: 实验表明低WER不一定保证高关键信息准确率，即使SOTA模型在文本规范化和语音准确性方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: 当前许多系统在WER上表现出色但在实际可懂度上可能不足，迫切需要更高层次、更贴近生活的评估标准。

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

Motivation: 研究神经音频编解码器(NACs)提供的连续向量和离散token两种语音表示在监督语音增强任务中的表现差异。

Method: 使用基于Conformer架构的自回归和非自回归语音增强模型，以及简单的编码器微调基线方法。

Result: 连续潜在表示预测始终优于离散token预测；自回归模型质量更高但牺牲了可懂度和效率；编码器微调获得最强的增强指标但会降低编解码重建质量。

Conclusion: 在语音增强任务中，连续向量表示优于离散token，非自回归模型更实用，编码器微调效果最佳但需权衡编解码重建质量。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) provide compact latent speech representations in
the form of sequences of continuous vectors or discrete tokens. In this work,
we investigate how these two types of speech representations compare when used
as training targets for supervised speech enhancement. We consider both
autoregressive and non-autoregressive speech enhancement models based on the
Conformer architecture, as well as a simple baseline where the NAC encoder is
simply fine-tuned for speech enhancement. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: predicting continuous latent representations consistently outperforms
discrete token prediction; autoregressive models achieve higher quality but at
the expense of intelligibility and efficiency, making non-autoregressive models
more attractive in practice; and encoder fine-tuning yields the strongest
enhancement metrics overall, though at the cost of degraded codec
reconstruction. The code and audio samples are available online.

Abstract: Generative modeling has recently achieved remarkable success across text,
image, and audio domains, demonstrating powerful capabilities for unified
representation learning. However, audio generation models still face challenges
in terms of audio quality and generalization ability across tasks. This
fragmentation results in redundant development efforts, inconsistent
performance, and limited extensibility. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{UniTok-Audio}, a scalable and extensible framework for unified audio
generation tasks. Specifically, 1) UniTok-Audio extracts continuous feature of
conditions to generates discrete tokens of target audio in an autoregressive
manner; 2) a special task identifier token unifies different learning patterns
of multiple tasks in a single framework; 3) a dual-stream audio codec involving
acoustic and semantic branch is developed for high-fidelity waveform
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that UniTok-Audio achieves
competitive performance in comparation with state-of-the-art task-specific or
multi-task systems across five time-aligned tasks: speech restoration, target
speaker extraction, speech separation, voice conversion, and language-queried
audio source separation. To foster future research, we will open-source our
codebase. The demo page of our work can be found here:

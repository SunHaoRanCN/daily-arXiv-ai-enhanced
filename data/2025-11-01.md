### [1] [Reading Radio from Camera: Visually-Grounded, Lightweight, and Interpretable RSSI Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25936)
*Sen Yan,Tianyu Hu,Brahim Mefgouda,Samson Lasaulce,Merouane Debbah*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理引导的轻量级框架，通过摄像头图像预测无线信号强度(RSSI)，将RSSI分解为路径损耗和阴影衰落两个物理可解释分量，显著降低了模型学习难度并增强了可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的无线信号预测框架依赖计算密集型模型且对环境干扰敏感，需要开发更鲁棒、轻量的解决方案。

Method: 将RSSI分解为路径损耗和阴影衰落两个物理可解释分量，使用基于MobileNet的轻量模型进行预测，显著减小模型规模。

Result: 在常规条件下将预测均方根误差(RMSE)降低50.3%，即使在消除干扰的基准条件下仍比先前基准低11.5%的RMSE，模型尺寸比竞争方案小19倍。

Conclusion: 该框架结合了高精度、抗干扰鲁棒性和计算效率，非常适合在边缘设备上进行实时部署，为更智能可靠的无线通信系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate, real-time wireless signal prediction is essential for
next-generation networks. However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely
on computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental
interference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided
and light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength
indicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically
interpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce
the model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach
establishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to
environmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our
model reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under
conventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the
previous benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance
is achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a
MobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions. The
combination of high accuracy, robustness to interference, and computational
efficiency makes our framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device
deployment in edge devices, paving the way for more intelligent and reliable
wireless communication systems.

### [2] [Lightweight Ac Arc Fault Diagnosis via Fourier Transform Inspired Multi-frequency Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26093)
*Qianchao Wang,Chuanzhen Jia,Yuxuan Ding,Zhe Li,Yaping Du*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MFNN的多频神经网络，用于轻量级在线串联电弧故障检测，通过嵌入物理先验知识和创新的网络架构，在资源受限条件下实现了快速响应和高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电弧故障诊断方法在资源受限条件下难以同时实现快速响应和鲁棒精度，需要开发轻量级在线检测方案来预防电气火灾。

Method: 基于电弧电流曲线和傅里叶分解分析，设计了具有超强表达能力的自适应激活函数EAS，以及带有分支网络的新型网络架构，帮助MFNN提取多频特征。

Result: MFNN在电弧故障定位方面优于其他模型，噪声免疫性显著优于LCNN和BLS，在SNR=-9时测试精度分别高出14.51%和16.3%。

Conclusion: EAS激活函数和网络架构共同贡献了MFNN的优异性能，为资源受限环境下的电弧故障检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Lightweight online detection of series arc faults is critically needed in
residential and industrial power systems to prevent electrical fires. Existing
diagnostic methods struggle to achieve both rapid response and robust accuracy
under resource-constrained conditions. To overcome the challenge, this work
suggests leveraging a multi-frequency neural network named MFNN, embedding
prior physical knowledge into the network. Inspired by arcing current curve and
the Fourier decomposition analysis, we create an adaptive activation function
with super-expressiveness, termed EAS, and a novel network architecture with
branch networks to help MFNN extract features with multiple frequencies. In our
experiments, eight advanced arc fault diagnosis models across an experimental
dataset with multiple sampling times and multi-level noise are used to
demonstrate the superiority of MFNN. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The
MFNN outperforms other models in arc fault location, befitting from signal
decomposition of branch networks. 2) The noise immunity of MFNN is much better
than that of other models, achieving 14.51% over LCNN and 16.3% over BLS in
test accuracy when SNR=-9. 3) EAS and the network architecture contribute to
the excellent performance of MFNN.

### [3] [Robust Super-Capacity SRS Channel Inpainting via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26097)
*Usman Akram,Fan Zhang,Yang Li,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型的信道修复框架，通过推理时整合系统模型知识，使单一训练模型能适应不匹配条件，在5G NR系统中实现鲁棒且可泛化的超容量SRS设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G NR中基于互易性的波束成形面临资源和覆盖限制，需要稀疏非均匀SRS分配。现有MAE方法会过拟合训练掩码，在未见失真下性能下降。

Method: 使用基于分数的扩散变体，在推理时通过似然梯度项整合系统模型知识，实现单一模型跨不匹配条件的自适应。

Result: 在标准化CDL信道上，该扩散方法在分布偏移下持续优于UNet基线，在挑战性场景下NMSE提升达14dB，同时在匹配条件下保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 扩散引导的修复是5G NR系统中鲁棒且可泛化的超容量SRS设计的有效方法。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for reliable multiuser
MIMO operation. In 5G NR, reciprocity-based beamforming via uplink Sounding
Reference Signals (SRS) face resource and coverage constraints, motivating
sparse non-uniform SRS allocation. Prior masked-autoencoder (MAE) approaches
improve coverage but overfit to training masks and degrade under unseen
distortions (e.g., additional masking, interference, clipping, non-Gaussian
noise). We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that
integrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term,
enabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On
standardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently
outperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution
shift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g.,
Laplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under
matched conditions. These results demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting
is a robust and generalizable approach for super-capacity SRS design in 5G NR
systems.

### [4] [Virtual-Real Collaborated Split Learning via Model Partitioning in IRS-Assisted IoT Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26150)
*Jiaying Di,Kunlun Wang,Jing Xu,Wen Chen,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数字孪生和智能反射面的计算通信协同设计框架，用于大规模分割学习，通过优化层分割点、DT分配、IRS相位矩阵等变量来最小化端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模物联网网络中分割学习的延迟问题，特别是在用户设备计算能力不足的情况下，通过数字孪生技术增强系统性能。

Method: 采用交替优化方法，结合闭式更新、半定松弛和低复杂度启发式算法，优化层分割点、DT分配决策、IRS相位矩阵、AP下行功率分配和DT频率调整。

Result: 仿真表明，所提方案相比传统基线显著降低训练延迟，在高用户密度和严格功率约束下可实现高达35%的延迟改进。

Conclusion: 该计算通信协同设计框架有效解决了大规模分割学习中的延迟优化问题，为IRS辅助的物联网网络提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel computation and communication co-design
framework for large-scale split learning in intelligent reflecting surface
(IRS)-assisted internet of things (IoT) networks integrated with digital twin
(DT) technique. The considered system consists of a multi-antenna access point
(AP), multiple heterogeneous user devices (UDs), and an deployed IRS to enhance
both uplink and downlink transmission. The training process of a deep neural
network is partitioned between devices and the AP, where a DT replica is
activated to replace UDs with insufficient local computation capabilities. We
formulate a delay-optimal split learning problem, which optimizes five key
variables: layer partitioning points, DT assignment decisions, IRS phase shift
matrix, AP downlink power allocation, and DT frequency adjustment, aiming to
minimize the overall end-to-end delay under communication and computation. The
proposed optimization problem is a highly coupled non-convex mixed-integer
problem. Therefore, we solve using an alternating optimization approach
combining closed-form updates, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and
low-complexity heuristics. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
scheme significantly reduces training delay compared to conventional baselines
and achieves up to 35\% delay improvement, especially under high UD density and
stringent power constraints.

### [5] [6D Channel Knowledge Map Construction via Bidirectional Wireless Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26166)
*Juncong Zhou,Chao Hu,Guanlin Wu,Zixiang Ren,Han Hu,Juyong Zhang,Rui Zhang,Jie Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个六维信道知识图框架BiWGS，使用高斯椭球体表示无线环境中的虚拟散射簇和环境障碍物，能够建模动态发射器和接收器位置的信道特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D/3D信道知识图方法假设基站配置固定，无法处理动态变化的发射器和接收器位置。需要开发能够建模六维空间（3D发射位置+3D接收位置）信道特性的新方法。

Method: 使用高斯椭球体表示虚拟散射簇和环境障碍物，通过学习双向散射模式和复杂衰减特性来捕获无线环境的电磁传输特性。

Result: BiWGS在构建6D信道功率增益图方面显著优于经典多层感知器，在3D信道知识图构建方面达到与最先进的无线辐射场高斯溅射方法相当的精度。

Conclusion: BiWGS能够在不损失保真度的情况下实现6D信道知识图的维度扩展，验证了其在动态收发器配置下准确建模信号传输的能力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the construction of channel knowledge map (CKM) from
sparse channel measurements. Dif ferent from conventional
two-/three-dimensional (2D/3D) CKM approaches assuming fixed base station
configurations, we present a six-dimensional (6D) CKM framework named
bidirectional wireless Gaussian splatting (BiWGS), which is capable of mod
eling wireless channels across dynamic transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx)
positions in 3D space. BiWGS uses Gaussian el lipsoids to represent virtual
scatterer clusters and environmental obstacles in the wireless environment. By
properly learning the bidirectional scattering patterns and complex attenuation
profiles based on channel measurements, these ellipsoids inherently cap ture
the electromagnetic transmission characteristics of wireless environments,
thereby accurately modeling signal transmission under varying transceiver
configurations. Experiment results show that BiWGS significantly outperforms
classic multi-layer perception (MLP) for the construction of 6D channel power
gain map with varying Tx-Rx positions, and achieves spatial spectrum prediction
accuracy comparable to the state-of-the art wireless radiation field Gaussian
splatting (WRF-GS) for 3D CKM construction. This validates the capability of
the proposed BiWGS in accomplishing dimensional expansion of 6D CKM
construction, without compromising fidelity.

### [6] [Design of Orthogonal Phase of Arrival Positioning Scheme Based on 5G PRS and Optimization of TOA Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26245)
*Juyeop Kim,Hyejin Shin,Sohee Kim,Ilmu Byun*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种在低采样率约束下提高5G NR信号TOA精度的算法，并研究PRS灵活资源配置对定位精度的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在5G网络中，终端位置通过基站发送的定位参考信号的到达时间来确定，需要提高TOA精度并优化PRS配置

Method: 提出改进TOA精度的算法，在软件定义调制解调器中实现5G PRS定位，分析PRS时频资源配置对TOA估计的影响

Result: 实现了在低采样率条件下提高TOA精度的算法，并确定了针对特定信号环境的最优PRS配置方案

Conclusion: 通过优化算法和PRS资源配置，可以有效提高5G定位系统的TOA估计精度

Abstract: This study analyzes the performance of positioning techniques based on
configuration changes of 5G New Radio signals. In 5G networks, a terminal
position is determined from the Time of Arrival of Positioning Reference
Signals transmitted by base stations. We propose an algorithm that improves TOA
accuracy under low sampling rate constraints and implement 5G PRS for
positioning in a software defined modem. We also examine how flexible time
frequency resource allocation of PRS affects TOA estimation accuracy and
discuss optimal PRS configurations for a given signal environment.

### [7] [Optimal transmit field distribution for partially obstructed continuous radiating surfaces in near-field communication systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26262)
*Francesco Verde,Donatella Darsena,Marco Di Renzo,Vincenzo Galdi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在遮挡环境中优化合成孔径场的方法，用于近场通信的能量聚焦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在障碍物的近场通信环境中，需要有效的方法来优化能量传输和聚焦，以克服衍射效应的影响。

Method: 采用基于刀口衍射的物理一致性模型，将问题表述为希尔伯特空间中的最大化问题，并通过匹配滤波器方法获得最优解。

Result: 得到了一个匹配衍射诱导核形状的最优解，将波传播与信号处理方法联系起来。

Conclusion: 该框架连接了物理建模、信号处理和硬件设计，为遮挡近场信道中的高效能量聚焦提供了解决方案。

Abstract: This paper deals with the optimal synthesis of aperture fields for
(radiating) near-field communications in obstructed environments. A physically
consistent model based on knife-edge diffraction is used to formulate the
problem as a maximization in Hilbert space. The optimal solution is obtained as
a matched filter that ``matches" the shape of a diffraction-induced kernel,
thus linking wave propagation with signal processing methods. The framework
supports hardware implementation using continuous apertures such as
metasurfaces or lens antennas. This approach bridges physically grounded
modeling, signal processing, and hardware design for efficient energy focusing
in near-field obstructed channels.

### [8] [SABER: Symbolic Regression-based Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26340)
*Shih-Kai Chou,Mengran Zhao,Cheng-Nan Hu,Kuang-Chung Chou,Carolina Fortuna,Jernej Hribar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出SABER框架，使用符号回归从路径损耗测量中自动发现闭式波束模式和AoA模型，在保持高精度的同时提供物理可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高分辨率AoA估计技术需要多天线阵列和大量快照采集，而通用机器学习方法缺乏物理可解释性。需要一种既能保持高精度又具有物理意义的AoA估计方法。

Method: 采用约束符号回归框架，从路径损耗测量中自动发现闭式波束模式和AoA模型。在自由空间消声室和RIS辅助室内测试平台进行验证。

Result: 在自由空间消声室中，直接反演已知cos^n波束和低阶多项式替代模型实现亚0.5度MAE；在RIS辅助室内测试平台中，SABER和无约束SR模型能准确恢复真实AoA，接近零误差。

Conclusion: SABER为AoA估计提供了一种可解释且准确的替代方案，弥合了不透明ML方法与可解释物理驱动估计器之间的差距。

Abstract: Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation
wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision
localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution
techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,
while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models
that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a
Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based
Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained
symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam
pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER
achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and
interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a
controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of
the known $\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5
degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further
reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that
lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a
real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.
SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with
near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\'er-Rao Lower
Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and
accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA
estimation.

### [9] [HMM for short independent sequences: Multiple sequence Baum-Welch application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26532)
*Margarita Cabrera-Bean,Josep Vidal,Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin,Albert Roso-Llorach,Concepcion Violan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了针对多独立短时间序列数据的HMM训练和解码伪代码，特别适用于人口健康纵向研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMM训练依赖单个长观测序列，但在人口健康等应用中，数据通常由多个独立的短时间序列组成，需要专门的处理方法

Method: 为多独立短时间序列场景开发了HMM训练和解码的伪代码公式，基于Baum-Welch算法的扩展

Result: 提供了适用于多短序列数据的HMM训练框架，能够处理人口健康研究中常见的纵向数据结构

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了HMM在短序列多轨迹数据场景下的应用，特别适用于人口健康纵向研究

Abstract: In the classical setting, the training of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
typically relies on a single, sufficiently long observation sequence that can
be regarded as representative of the underlying stochastic process. In this
context, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied in its
specialized form for HMMs, namely the Baum Welch algorithm, which has been
extensively employed in applications such as speech recognition. The objective
of this work is to present pseudocode formulations for both the training and
decoding procedures of HMMs in a different scenario, where the available data
consist of multiple independent temporal sequences generated by the same model,
each of relatively short duration, i.e., containing only a limited number of
samples. Special emphasis is placed on the relevance of this formulation to
longitudinal studies in population health, where datasets are naturally
structured as collections of short trajectories across individuals with point
data at follow up.

### [10] [Statistically Adaptive Differential Protection for AC Microgrids Based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26604)
*Shahab Moradi Torkashvand,Arina Kharazi,Emad Sadeghi,Seyed Hossein Hesamedin Sadeghi,Adel Nasiri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于Kullback-Leibler散度的统计自适应差动保护方案，使用Bartlett校正G统计量和对数变换电流幅值，实现微电网故障检测和分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆变器资源的普及给传统微电网保护带来挑战，因为引入了可变的故障电流和复杂瞬态过程。

Method: 采用基于Mahalanobis距离的多变量故障检测引擎，使用卡方分布统计推导检测阈值，结合轻量级分类器和时间持久性滤波器进行故障类型识别。

Result: 在改进的CIGRE 14总线微电网上进行广泛仿真，显示亚周期平均检测延迟、高检测和分类精度、对高达250欧姆高阻抗故障的鲁棒性、10ms通信延迟容忍度以及20dB信噪比噪声水平下的良好性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代交流微电网保护提供了可重现且计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of inverter-based resources challenges traditional
microgrid protection by introducing variable fault currents and complex
transients. This paper presents a statistically adaptive differential
protection scheme based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, implemented via a
Bartlett-corrected G-statistic computed on logarithm-transformed current
magnitudes. The method is a multivariate fault detection engine that employs
the Mahalanobis distance to distinguish healthy and faulty states, enabling
robust detection even in noisy environments. Detection thresholds are
statistically derived from a chi-squared distribution for precise control over
the false alarm rate. Upon detection, a lightweight classifier identifies the
fault type by assessing per-phase G-statistics against dedicated thresholds,
enhanced by a temporal persistence filter for security. Extensive simulations
on a modified CIGRE 14-bus microgrid show high efficacy: sub-cycle average
detection delays, high detection and classification accuracy across operating
modes, resilience to high-impedance faults up to 250 Ohms, tolerance to 10 ms
communication delay, and noise levels down to a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio.
These findings demonstrate a reproducible and computationally efficient
solution for next-generation AC microgrid protection.

### [11] [Graph Guided Modulo Recovery of EEG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26756)
*Soujanya Hazra,Sanjay Ghosh*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出GraphUnwrapNet方法，使用图神经网络解决EEG信号模数采样恢复问题，通过预估计引导特征注入模块提高边界恢复稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号存在显著个体差异，模数采样可避免信号饱和但恢复过程高度不适定，需要稳健的恢复方法。

Method: 将EEG信号表示为有组织的图结构，利用通道和时间连接建立内在依赖关系，引入预估计引导特征注入模块提供粗粒度折叠指示。

Result: 在STEW数据集上的实验表明，相比传统优化方法有持续改进，与当前深度学习模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于图的方法在稳健的模数EEG恢复方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) often shows significant variability among
people. This fluctuation disrupts reliable acquisition and may result in
distortion or clipping. Modulo sampling is now a promising solution to this
problem, by folding signals instead of saturating them. Recovery of the
original waveform from folded observations is a highly ill-posed problem. In
this work, we propose a method based on a graph neural network, referred to as
GraphUnwrapNet, for the modulo recovery of EEG signals. Our core idea is to
represent an EEG signal as an organized graph whose channels and temporal
connections establish underlying interdependence. One of our key contributions
is in introducing a pre-estimation guided feature injection module to provide
coarse folding indicators that enhance stability during recovery at wrap
boundaries. This design integrates structural information with folding priors
into an integrated framework. We performed comprehensive experiments on the
Simultaneous Task EEG Workload (STEW) dataset. The results demonstrate
consistent enhancements over traditional optimization techniques and
competitive accuracy relative to current deep learning models. Our findings
emphasize the potential of graph-based methodology for robust modulo EEG
recovery.

### [12] [SPEAR: A Unified SSL Framework for Learning Speech and Audio Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25955)
*Xiaoyu Yang,Yifan Yang,Zengrui Jin,Ziyun Cui,Wen Wu,Baoxiang Li,Chao Zhang,Phil Woodland*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: SPEAR是首个成功从语音和音频混合数据中学习统一表示的SSL框架，通过掩码预测细粒度离散标记的统一预训练目标，在SUPERB和HEAR基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法仍局限于特定领域（语音或通用音频），阻碍了开发具有全面能力的统一表示模型。

Method: 提出基于掩码预测细粒度离散标记的统一预训练目标，使用多码本向量量化方法从连续表示中提取离散标记，保留丰富的声学细节。

Result: 语音域模型在SUPERB基准测试中创下新纪录，在15个任务中的12个上匹配或超越WavLM Large；统一模型在SUPERB和HEAR基准测试中展示全面能力；600M参数模型在双领域表现优异。

Conclusion: SPEAR是功能最强大、最多样化的开源SSL听觉理解模型之一，证明了统一语音和音频表示学习的可行性。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) excels at learning generic representations of
acoustic signals, yet prevailing methods remain domain-specific, tailored to
either speech or general audio, hindering the development of a unified
representation model with a comprehensive capability over both domains. To
address this, we present SPEAR (SPEech and Audio Representations), the first
SSL framework to successfully learn unified speech and audio representations
from a mixture of speech and audio data. SPEAR proposes a unified pre-training
objective based on masked prediction of fine-grained discrete tokens for both
speech and general audio. These tokens are derived from continuous speech and
audio representations using a Multi-codebook Vector Quantisation (MVQ) method,
retaining rich acoustic detail essential for modelling both speech and complex
audio events. SPEAR is applied to pre-train both single-domain and unified
speech-and-audio SSL models. Our speech-domain model establishes a new
state-of-the-art on the SUPERB benchmark, a speech processing benchmark for SSL
models, matching or surpassing the highly competitive WavLM Large on 12 out of
15 tasks with the same pre-training corpora and a similar model size.
Crucially, our unified model learns complementary features and demonstrates
comprehensive capabilities across two major benchmarks, SUPERB and HEAR, for
evaluating audio representations. By further scaling up the model size and
pre-training data, we present a unified model with 600M parameters that excels
in both domains, establishing it as one of the most powerful and versatile
open-source SSL models for auditory understanding. The inference code and
pre-trained models will be made publicly available.

### [13] [SP-MCQA: Evaluating Intelligibility of TTS Beyond the Word Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26190)
*Hitomi Jin Ling Tee,Chaoren Wang,Zijie Zhang,Zhizheng Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的TTS可懂度评估方法SP-MCQA，通过口语段落多选问答评估合成语音中关键信息的准确性，发现低WER并不保证高关键信息准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS可懂度评估过度依赖WER等逐词准确性指标，无法捕捉真实语音的复杂性或反映人类理解需求。

Method: 提出口语段落多选问答(SP-MCQA)主观评估方法，并发布了8.76小时新闻风格基准数据集SP-MCQA-Eval。

Result: 实验显示低WER不一定保证高关键信息准确率，暴露了传统指标与实际可懂度之间的差距。即使SOTA模型在文本归一化和语音准确性方面仍存在不足。

Conclusion: 当前许多系统在WER上表现优异但在真实世界可懂度上可能不足，迫切需要更高级、更贴近生活的评估标准。

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

### [14] [Modeling strategies for speech enhancement in the latent space of a neural audio codec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26299)
*Sofiene Kammoun,Xavier Alameda-Pineda,Simon Leglaive*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 比较神经音频编解码器的连续向量和离散标记作为语音增强训练目标的效果，发现连续向量预测优于离散标记，非自回归模型在实践上更具优势，编码器微调能获得最佳增强效果但会降低编解码重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经音频编解码器(NACs)生成的连续向量和离散标记这两种语音表示在监督语音增强任务中的性能差异，为选择合适的训练目标提供指导。

Method: 使用基于Conformer架构的自回归和非自回归语音增强模型，以及简单的编码器微调基线方法，对比连续向量和离散标记作为训练目标的效果。

Result: 连续潜在表示预测始终优于离散标记预测；自回归模型质量更高但牺牲了可懂度和效率；编码器微调获得最强的增强指标但会降低编解码重建质量。

Conclusion: 在语音增强任务中，预测连续潜在表示优于离散标记，非自回归模型在实践上更实用，编码器微调是有效的增强方法但需权衡编解码性能。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) provide compact latent speech representations in
the form of sequences of continuous vectors or discrete tokens. In this work,
we investigate how these two types of speech representations compare when used
as training targets for supervised speech enhancement. We consider both
autoregressive and non-autoregressive speech enhancement models based on the
Conformer architecture, as well as a simple baseline where the NAC encoder is
simply fine-tuned for speech enhancement. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: predicting continuous latent representations consistently outperforms
discrete token prediction; autoregressive models achieve higher quality but at
the expense of intelligibility and efficiency, making non-autoregressive models
more attractive in practice; and encoder fine-tuning yields the strongest
enhancement metrics overall, though at the cost of degraded codec
reconstruction. The code and audio samples are available online.

Motivation: 音频语言模型引入了新的安全漏洞，传统音频对抗攻击或文本大语言模型越狱的防御方法对ALM特定威胁效果不佳，需要专门防御方案。

Method: 基于ALMs中存在安全对齐捷径的假设，设计识别通用捷径激活扰动（SAPs）的方法，并提出Mel梯度稀疏掩码（M-GSM）来限制扰动范围，在保持模型效用的同时筛选有效触发。

Result: 将先进ALM特定越狱攻击的平均成功率降至4.6%（跨四个模型），同时在良性基准测试中保持可比性能。

Conclusion: ALMGuard在理论和实证上都证明了其对已知和未知攻击的鲁棒性，成为新的最先进防御方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved
multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio
modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies
have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that
defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective
against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard,
the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that
safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to
identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as
triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference
time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's
utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM),
which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to
jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both
seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate
of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while
maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new
state of the art. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: Generative modeling has recently achieved remarkable success across text,
image, and audio domains, demonstrating powerful capabilities for unified
representation learning. However, audio generation models still face challenges
in terms of audio quality and generalization ability across tasks. This
fragmentation results in redundant development efforts, inconsistent
performance, and limited extensibility. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{UniTok-Audio}, a scalable and extensible framework for unified audio
generation tasks. Specifically, 1) UniTok-Audio extracts continuous feature of
conditions to generates discrete tokens of target audio in an autoregressive
manner; 2) a special task identifier token unifies different learning patterns
of multiple tasks in a single framework; 3) a dual-stream audio codec involving
acoustic and semantic branch is developed for high-fidelity waveform
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that UniTok-Audio achieves
competitive performance in comparation with state-of-the-art task-specific or
multi-task systems across five time-aligned tasks: speech restoration, target
speaker extraction, speech separation, voice conversion, and language-queried
audio source separation. To foster future research, we will open-source our
codebase. The demo page of our work can be found here:

As a UNESCO-recognized intangible cultural heritage,\nNanyin follows a heterophonic tradition centered around the pipa, where core\nmelodies are notated in traditional notation while ornamentations are passed\ndown orally, presenting challenges for both preservation and contemporary\ninnovation. To address this, we construct a Pipa-Centric MIDI dataset, develop\nNanyinTok as a specialized tokenization method, and convert symbolic sequences\ninto graph structures using a Graph Converter to ensure that key musical\nfeatures are preserved. Our key innovation reformulates ornamentation\ngeneration as the creation of ornamentation nodes within a heterogeneous graph.\nFirst, a graph neural network generates melodic outlines optimized for\nornamentations.

We design a low-complexity and energy-neutral IoT node, namely\nbackscatter device (BD) which harvests energy from light-emitting diode (LED)\naccess points, and then modulates and reflects ambient RF carriers to indicate\nits location within particular VLC cells. We present a multi-cell VLC\ndeployment with frequency division multiplexing (FDM) method that mitigates\ninterference among LED access points by assigning them distinct frequency pairs\nbased on a four-color map scheduling principle. We develop a lightweight\nparticle filter (PF) tracking algorithm at an edge RF reader, where the fusion\nof proximity reports and the received backscatter signal strength are employed\nto track the BD.

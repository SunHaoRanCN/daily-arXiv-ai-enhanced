### [1] [DiffPace: Diffusion-based Plug-and-play Augmented Channel Estimation in mmWave and Terahertz Ultra-Massive MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01867)
*Zhengdong Hu,Chong Han,Wolfgang Gerstacker,Robert Schober*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: DiffPace是一种基于扩散模型的即插即用信道估计方法，用于毫米波和太赫兹超大规模MIMO系统，通过混合球面波和平面波模型捕获信道分布，在减少90%推理步骤的同时实现-15 dB NMSE的高精度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波和太赫兹通信面临严重的路径损耗，传统压缩感知方法无法准确捕捉混合近场和远场信道结构，导致信道估计性能下降。

Method: 使用扩散模型作为先验知识，通过即插即用方法结合混合球面波和平面波模型，利用常微分方程进行推理以减少推理步骤。

Result: 在信噪比10 dB时达到-15 dB归一化均方误差，比最先进方案减少90%推理步骤，同时提供高估计精度和计算效率。

Conclusion: DiffPace在毫米波和太赫兹超大规模MIMO系统中实现了高精度信道估计和显著的计算效率提升，为下一代无线网络提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz)-band communications hold great
promise in meeting the growing data-rate demands of next-generation wireless
networks, offering abundant bandwidth. To mitigate the severe path loss
inherent to these high frequencies and reduce hardware costs, ultra-massive
multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming
architectures can deliver substantial beamforming gains and enhanced spectral
efficiency. However, accurate channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO
systems is challenging due to high channel dimensionality and compressed
observations from a limited number of RF chains, while the hybrid near- and
far-field radiation patterns, arising from large array apertures and high
carrier frequencies, further complicate CE. Conventional compressive sensing
based frameworks rely on predefined sparsifying matrices, which cannot
faithfully capture the hybrid near-field and far-field channel structures,
leading to degraded estimation performance. This paper introduces DiffPace, a
diffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation. DiffPace uses a
diffusion model (DM) to capture the channel distribution based on the hybrid
spherical and planar-wave (HPSM) model. By applying the plug-and-play approach,
it leverages the DM as prior knowledge, improving CE accuracy. Moreover, DM
performs inference by solving an ordinary differential equation, minimizing the
number of required inference steps compared with stochastic sampling method.
Experimental results show that DiffPace achieves competitive CE performance,
attaining -15 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of 10 dB, with 90\% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art
schemes, simultaneously providing high estimation precision and enhanced
computational efficiency.

### [2] [An unscented Kalman filter method for real time input-parameter-state estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02717)
*Marios Impraimakis,Andrew W. Smyth*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种新型无迹卡尔曼滤波器在线性和非线性系统中的输入-参数-状态估计能力，通过两阶段输入估计和扰动分析证明了系统可识别性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输出参数识别策略只能估计参数，而该方法能够联合实时估计所有动态状态、参数和输入，从而更好地理解系统。

Method: 采用两阶段输入估计方法：首先用预测的动态状态和系统参数估计输入，然后用测量校正后的状态和参数提供最终估计。

Result: 通过扰动分析证明，至少具有零或非零已知输入的系统可能被唯一识别，实现了比传统输出参数识别策略更好的系统理解。

Conclusion: 该输出方法能够联合实时估计动态状态、参数和输入，为系统识别提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: The input-parameter-state estimation capabilities of a novel unscented Kalman
filter is examined herein on both linear and nonlinear systems. The unknown
input is estimated in two stages within each time step. Firstly, the predicted
dynamic states and the system parameters provide an estimation of the input.
Secondly, the corrected with measurements states and parameters provide a final
estimation. Importantly, it is demonstrated using the perturbation analysis
that, a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially
be uniquely identified. This output-only methodology allows for a better
understanding of the system compared to classical output-only parameter
identification strategies, given that all the dynamic states, the parameters,
and the input are estimated jointly and in real-time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球许多地区缺乏临床多通道EEG数据，需要开发在资源受限环境中可部署的低成本癫痫诊断工具。

Abstract: Access to clinical multi-channel EEG remains limited in many regions
worldwide. We present NEUROSKY-EPI, the first open dataset of single-channel,
consumer-grade EEG for epilepsy, collected in a South Asian clinical setting
along with rich contextual metadata. To explore its utility, we introduce
EmbedCluster, a patient-stratification pipeline that transfers representations
from EEGNet models trained on clinical data and enriches them with contextual
autoencoder embeddings, followed by unsupervised clustering of patients based
on EEG patterns. Results show that low-cost, single-channel data can support
meaningful stratification. Beyond algorithmic performance, we emphasize
human-centered concerns such as deployability in resource-constrained
environments, interpretability for non-specialists, and safeguards for privacy,
inclusivity, and bias. By releasing the dataset and code, we aim to catalyze
interdisciplinary research across health technology, human-computer
interaction, and machine learning, advancing the goal of affordable and
actionable EEG-based epilepsy care.

### [4] [Design of an M-ary Chaos Shift Keying System Using Combined Chaotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01882)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于组合混沌序列的M元CSK系统，无需混沌同步，使用深度学习进行符号恢复，在AWGN和多径瑞利衰落信道中表现优于现有CSK系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CSK通信系统实现混沌同步成本高且在噪声环境中难以实现，需要一种无需同步的混沌通信方案。

Method: 通过组合两个不同混沌系统生成的不同长度混沌段构建混沌序列，仅用一种混沌段调制信息信号；接收端使用精心设计的二元分类深度学习单元恢复信息符号。

Result: 在AWGN和多径瑞利衰落信道中评估了系统性能，分析了接收序列失准对SER的影响，在多径瑞利衰落信道中显著优于现有CSK系统。

Conclusion: CCS-M-CSK系统是各种应用（包括V2X）的有前景候选方案，具有无需混沌同步和优越的抗多径性能。

Abstract: In traditional chaos shift keying (CSK) communication systems, implementing
chaotic synchronization techniques is costly but practically unattainable in a
noisy environment. This paper proposes a combined chaotic sequences-based
$M$-ary CSK (CCS-$M$-CSK) system that eliminates the need for chaotic
synchronization. At the transmitter, the chaotic sequence is constructed by
combining two chaotic segments of different lengths, where each is generated
from distinct chaotic systems and only one kind of chaotic segment modulates
the information signal. At the receiver, a deep learning unit with binary
classification is meticulously designed to recover information symbols. The
symbol error rate (SER) performance of the proposed system is evaluated over
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels.
Specifically, the impact of varying misalignment lengths on the SER performance
of the system is analyzed when the received sequence is misaligned.
Furthermore, the proposed system demonstrates significant performance
advantages over existing CSK-based systems in multipath Rayleigh fading
channels. These features establish CCS-$M$-CSK as a promising candidate for
various applications, including Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X).

### [5] [A Comparison of Road Grade Preview Signals from Lidar and Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02006)
*Logan Schexnaydre,Aman Poovalappil,Darrell Robinette,Jeremy Bos*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用车载激光雷达实时估计道路坡度的方法，通过卡尔曼滤波技术处理里程计和运动不确定性，与基于地图的系统相比具有相似的精度，为自动驾驶车辆提供了更高的冗余性和独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有控制系统要么只能在车辆行驶时通过本体感知获取坡度信息，要么完全依赖预设地图数据，这两种方法都有局限性。前者无法实现主动坡度补偿，后者可能面临数据缺失或过时的问题。

Method: 利用车载激光雷达在行驶过程中积累的点云数据，通过计算给定路径点前后轮轴之间的高度差来估计坡度，并使用卡尔曼滤波技术来减轻里程计和运动不确定性对坡度估计的影响。

Result: 与基于GNSS/INS系统创建的地图测量相比，激光雷达估计器产生的无偏误差标准差为0.6度，平均范围为52.7米，精度与基于地图的系统相当。

Conclusion: 激光雷达坡度估计系统在无法获取或地图不准确时是一种有效的道路坡度测量方法，为自动驾驶车辆提供了更高的冗余性和独立性。

Abstract: Road grade can impact the energy efficiency, safety, and comfort associated
with automated vehicle control systems. Currently, control systems that attempt
to compensate for road grade are designed with one of two assumptions. Either
the grade is only known once the vehicle is driving over the road segment
through proprioception, or complete knowledge of the oncoming road grade is
known from a pre-made map. Both assumptions limit the performance of a control
system, as not having a preview signal prevents proactive grade compensation,
whereas relying only on map data potentially subjects the control system to
missing or outdated information. These limits can be avoided by measuring the
oncoming grade in real-time using on-board lidar sensors. In this work, we use
point returns accumulated during travel to estimate the grade at each waypoint
along a path. The estimated grade is defined as the difference in height
between the front and rear wheelbase at a given waypoint. Kalman filtering
techniques are used to mitigate the effects of odometry and motion uncertainty
on the grade estimates. This estimator's performance is compared to the
measurements of a map created with a GNSS/INS system via a field experiment.
When compared to the map-based system, the lidar-based estimator produces an
unbiased error with a standard deviation of 0.6 degrees at an average range of
52.7 meters. By having similar precision to map-based systems, automotive
lidar-based grade estimation systems are shown to be a valid approach for
measuring road grade when a map is unavailable or inaccurate. In using lidar as
an input signal for grade-based control system tasks, autonomous vehicles
achieve higher redundancy and independence in contrast to existing methods.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于深度强化学习的路由框架，用于异构无线网络中的多跳路由，通过联合选择通信技术、子带和中继节点来优化路由速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构无线网络中传统路由方法无法应对多技术链路、频率相关衰落和动态拓扑变化带来的复杂性，需要更高效自适应的路由方案。

Method: 使用深度Q网络（DQN）的深度强化学习方法，让每个节点联合选择通信技术、子带和下一跳中继，结合信道和干扰感知的邻居选择方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该框架在复杂异构无线网络场景中显著提高了可扩展性、适应性和端到端吞吐量。

Conclusion: 基于深度强化学习的路由框架能够有效解决异构无线网络中的路由挑战，在各种网络动态变化下表现出良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs), where
devices with diverse communication technologies coexist, there is increasing
demand for efficient and adaptive multi-hop routing with multiple data flows.
Traditional routing methods, designed for homogeneous environments, fail to
address the complexity introduced by links consisting of multiple technologies,
frequency-dependent fading, and dynamic topology changes. In this paper, we
propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based routing framework using deep
Q-networks (DQN) to establish routes between multiple source-destination pairs
in HWNs by enabling each node to jointly select a communication technology, a
subband, and a next hop relay that maximizes the rate of the route. Our
approach incorporates channel and interference-aware neighbor selection
approaches to improve decision-making beyond conventional distance-based
heuristics. We further evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the
proposed method under varying network dynamics, including node mobility,
changes in node density, and the number of data flows. Simulation results
demonstrate that our DRL-based routing framework significantly enhances
scalability, adaptability, and end-to-end throughput in complex HWN scenarios.

Conclusion: 所提出的智能保护方案能够有效处理不同系统配置和条件，为连接到大型光伏电站的输电线路提供可靠保护，且通过半监督学习在有限标注数据下实现接近监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Conventional relays encounter difficulties in protecting transmission lines
(TLs) connected to converter-based energy sources (CBESs) due to the influence
of power electronics on fault characteristics. This article proposes a
single-ended intelligent protection method for the TL segment between the grid
and a Photovoltaic (PV) plant. The approach utilizes a Recurrence Matrix and an
InceptionTime-based system to identify faults by using the mean change in
quantiles of 3-phase currents. It determines the fault position and identifies
the faulty phase. ReliefF feature selection is applied to extract the optimal
quantile features. The scheme's performance is assessed under abnormal
conditions, including faults and capacitor and load-switching events, simulated
in Power Systems Computer Aided Design / Electromagnetic Transients Program
(PSCAD/EMTDC) on the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus system,
with various fault and switching parameters. The scheme is also validated on
the New England IEEE 39-bus system and in presence of partially rated
converters. Additionally, the validation of the proposed strategy takes into
account various conditions, including double-circuit line configuration, noise,
series compensation, high-impedance faults, current transformer (CT)
saturation, evolving and cross-country faults, remote and local faults, as well
as variations in PV capacity, sampling frequency, and data window size. To
address label scarcity and improve generalization, semi-supervised learning
paradigms including label spreading, label propagation, and self-training are
integrated with the InceptionTime framework, enabling near-supervised
performance with limited annotated fault data. The results demonstrate that the
approach is effective in handling different system configurations and
conditions, ensuring the protection of TLs connected to large PV plants.

Conclusion: 机器学习在分子通信中具有强大的信号检测潜力，特别是在多发射器系统中处理干扰和复杂传播动态方面。

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a promising paradigm for applications where
traditional electromagnetic communications are impractical. However, decoding
chemical signals, especially in multi-transmitter systems, remains a key
challenge due to interference and complex propagation dynamics. In this paper,
we develop a one-dimensional fractal convolutional neural network (fCNN) to
detect the concentrations of multiple types of molecules based on the
absorbance spectra measured at a receiver. Our model is trained by both
experimental and simulated datasets, with the latter enhanced by noise modeling
to mimic real-world measurements. We demonstrate that a noiseaugmented
simulated dataset can effectively be a substitute for experimental data,
achieving similar decoding accuracy. Our approach successfully detects bit
sequences in both binary and quadruple concentration shift keying (BCSK and
QCSK) scenarios, even when transmitters are desynchronized, highlighting the
potential of machine learning for robust MC signal detection.

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的波束跟踪框架，结合位置感知波束预选策略和循环神经网络序列预测，在包含50%非视距场景的挑战性环境下保持高精度，同时减少50%的波束测量开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波通信虽然支持高数据速率，但存在严重的路径损耗，需要精确的波束对准。在车辆到基础设施等高度动态场景中，波束管理尤为困难。

Conclusion: 所提出的深度学习波束跟踪框架在挑战性非视距场景下表现出强大的鲁棒性，显著降低了波束管理开销。

Abstract: Millimeter wave communications are essential for modern wireless networks. It
supports high data rates but suffers from severe path loss, which requires
precise beam alignment to maintain reliable links. This beam management is
particularly challenging in highly dynamic scenarios such as
vehicle-to-infrastructure, and several methods have been presented. In this
work, we propose a deep learning-based beam tracking framework that combines a
position-aware beam pre-selection strategy with sequential prediction using
recurrent neural networks. The proposed architecture can support deep learning
models trained for both classification and regression. In contrast to many
existing studies that evaluate beam tracking under predominantly line-of-sight
(LOS) conditions, our work explicitly includes highly challenging non-LOS
scenarios - with up to 50% non-LOS incidence in certain datasets - to
rigorously assess model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach maintains high top-K accuracy, even under adverse conditions, while
reducing the beam measurement overhead by up to 50%.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel large language model (LLM)-based pathloss map
generation model, termed LLM4PG, is proposed for sixth-generation (6G)
AI-native communication systems via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To explore
the mapping mechanism between sensing images and pathloss maps, a new synthetic
intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset, SynthSoM-U2G, is
constructed, covering multiple scenarios, frequency bands, and flight
altitudes. By adapting the LLM for cross-modal pathloss map generation for the
first time, LLM4PG establishes an effective cross-domain alignment between the
multi-modal sensing-communication and natural language domains. A task-specific
fine-tuning strategy with a tailored layer selection and activation scheme is
designed to meet the demands of massive-scale, high-quality generation.
Compared with conventional deep learning artificial intelligence generated

and stronger generalization across diverse conditions. Results show that LLM4PG
attains an NMSE of 0.0454, outperforming the conventional AIGC model by over
2.90 dB, while its cross-condition generalization achieves an NMSE of 0.0492,
exceeding the baseline by 4.52 dB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统识别中存在不确定性，不同初始参数集猜测会得到不同结果，需要一种方法来选择最合理的估计结果。

Method: 首先对多个不同初始参数集执行卡尔曼滤波，然后使用Kullback-Leibler散度同时比较后验分布与先验分布，最后选择Kullback-Leibler散度最小的识别结果。

Result: 该方法在线性、非线性和信息受限应用中都能选择性能更好的识别结果，为系统监控提供了有力工具。

Conclusion: 基于Kullback-Leibler散度的方法能够有效选择最合理的系统识别结果，解决了初始参数不确定性带来的问题。

Abstract: The capability of a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence method is examined
herein within the Kalman filter framework to select the input-parameter-state
estimation execution with the most plausible results. This identification
suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining different results from
different initial parameter set guesses, and the examined approach uses the
information gained from the data in going from the prior to the posterior
distribution to address the issue. Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for
a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system
input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior
distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions
using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the
least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most
plausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better
performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information
applications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的IF-TEM采样器虽然功率效率高，但采样率和比特使用仍有优化空间。AIF-TEM通过自适应降低采样率，CIF-TEM通过压缩减少比特使用，但两者单独使用效果有限。

Method: 提出ACIF-TEM采样器，将自适应IF-TEM和压缩IF-TEM相结合，并设计了一种高效的无时钟时间数字转换器架构，将压缩阶段集成在TDC内部。

Conclusion: ACIF-TEM通过结合自适应和压缩技术，在降低比特使用的同时提高了信号恢复精度，为高效异步采样提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Machine (IF-TEM) is a power-efficient
asynchronous sampler that converts analog signals into non-uniform time-domain
samples. Adaptive IF-TEM (AIF-TEM) improves this machine by adapting its
process to the characteristics of the input signal, thereby reducing the
sampling rate. Compressed IF-TEM (CIF-TEM) reduces bit usage by performing
analog compression before quantization. In this paper, we introduce a combined
Adaptive Compressed IF-TEM (ACIF-TEM) -- a new sampler that leverages the two
machines, AIF-TEM and CIF-TEM, where each reinforces the effectiveness of the
other. We propose an efficient adaptive clockless time-to-digital converter
(TDC) architecture for the novel sampler that integrates the compression stage
within the TDC, facilitating the realization of the intended integrated system.
\ifconf \else We analyze the total bit usage, and contrast its performance with
that of IF-TEM, AIF-TEM, and CIF-TEM.\fi Via an evaluation study, we
demonstrate that the proposed ACIF-TEM sampler achieves lower Mean Square Error
(MSE) with fewer bits, offering compression gains of at least 3-bit out of
9-bits over AIF-TEM and 60\% compression over IF-TEM, for fixed recovery MSE
with real audio signals.

Transfer Function (dDTF) and generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Our
findings reveal increased functional connectivity in frontal regions during
higher MWL conditions (3-back compared to 0-back). Furthermore, effective
connectivity analysis demonstrates a significant directional information flow
from EEG to fNIRS, indicating a dominant influence of neural activity on
hemodynamic responses. Statistical tests confirm significant differences in
connectivity patterns between low and high MWL states. These results underscore
the utility of EEG-fNIRS integration for characterizing brain network dynamics
under varying cognitive demands and provide insights into neurovascular
coupling mechanisms during mental workload.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可编程无线环境(PWE)的RF框架，使用材料感知球形基元进行三维物体重建，结合RIS场合成和DETR检测器，实现79.35%的几何和材料分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光学方法在遮挡或低光照条件下性能下降，而射频(RF)传感能穿透材料并编码几何和成分信息，但多径传播限制了重建精度。可编程无线环境(PWEs)通过软件定义传播控制提供了解决方案。

Method: 结合RIS使能的场合成与检测变换器(DETR)，直接从提取的RF特征推断空间和材料参数，使用材料感知球形基元进行三维重建。

Result: 仿真结果证实该框架能够近似物体几何形状并分类材料成分，总体准确率达到79.35%。

Conclusion: 这是向可编程和物理基础的RF基三维物体成分可视化迈出的初步步骤。

Abstract: The pursuit of immersive and structurally aware multimedia experiences has
intensified interest in sensing modalities that reconstruct objects beyond the
limits of visible light. Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion
or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose
electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and
compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts
reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments
(PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of
propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby
providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability,
this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object
reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach
combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that
infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features.
Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object
geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of
79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded
RF-based 3D object composition visualization.

Motivation: 在未知和动态干扰环境下提升雷达感知性能，解决非高斯杂波下的目标检测问题，实现感知与通信的频谱高效集成。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided cognitive framework
for massive MIMO-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems
employing a uniform planar array (UPA). The focus is on enhancing radar sensing
performance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance
characteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection
under non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive
estimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on
the RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is
formulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication
throughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between
detection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived
closed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed
cognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability
compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining
competitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of
RL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation
wireless networks.

TL;DR: 本文研究RIS辅助的全双工ISAC系统，在考虑自干扰和有限块长度约束下，通过优化框架最小化服务适应差距，同时确保感知可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成感知与通信是6G网络的关键技术，但实际实现面临全双工系统的自干扰和有限块长度传输性能下降等挑战。

Method: 采用交替优化和逐次凸逼近方法，优化RIS辅助的全双工ISAC系统，服务多个下行用户同时跟踪移动目标。

Result: 数值结果表明，短块长度可实现快速适应但会增加雷达中断概率，长块长度可改善SINR但运动会影响感知性能，存在最优平衡点。

Conclusion: RIS辅助优化能够找到通信和雷达感知的平衡点，实现可靠的联合通信和感知性能。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone for future
sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous connectivity and
environmental awareness. However, practical realization faces significant
challenges, including residual self-interference (SI) in full-duplex systems
and performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite
blocklength (FBL) constraints. This work studies a reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex ISAC system serving multiple downlink users
while tracking a moving target, explicitly accounting for SI and FBL effects in
both communication and sensing. We formulate an optimization framework to
minimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability, solved via
alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results
show that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but raise radar outage from
fewer pulses and motion sensitivity. Longer blocklengths improve
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and reduce outages but allow
motion to degrade sensing. A "sweet spot" arises where blocklength and
beamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing, seen as a local minimum
in radar SINR variance. RIS-assisted optimization identifies this balance,
achieving reliable communication and radar sensing jointly.

*Smilja Stokanović,Jaka Sodnik,Nadica Miljković*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究通过眼动追踪分析比较了三种条件下的眼动行为：基线、正常能见度驾驶和低能见度驾驶。研究发现低能见度显著影响注视稳定性和眨眼行为，并引入Guzik指数来量化注视不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同能见度条件下驾驶时的眼动行为变化，特别关注低能见度对视觉注意力和注视稳定性的影响。

Method: 使用31个眼动参数分析眼动数据，分为三组：扫视特征（13个）、双变量轮廓椭圆面积（BCEA，13个）和眨眼特征（5个）。引入新的参数Guzik指数来量化注视不对称性。

Result: 基线与驾驶条件间存在显著差异，特别是基线与正常/低能见度驾驶之间。低能见度对扫视特征影响较小（13个中1个显著），但对BCEA（13个中9个显著）和眨眼特征（5个中4个显著）影响显著。Guzik指数提供了注视不对称性的额外洞察。

Conclusion: 结合BCEA、扫视和眨眼参数能全面理解视觉注意力和注视稳定性，Guzik指数为不同能见度条件下的注视不对称性提供了有价值的补充信息。

Abstract: This study investigates eye movement behaviour during three conditions:
Baseline, Ride (simulated drive under normal visibility), and Fog (simulated
drive under reduced visibility). Eye tracking data are analyzed using 31
parameters, organized into three groups: (1) saccade features, (2) Bivariate
Contour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and (3) blinking features. Specifically, the
analysis includes 13 saccade, 13 BCEA, and 5 blinking variables. Across all
feature groups, numerous statistically significant differences emerge between
Baseline and the driving conditions, particularly between Baseline and Ride or
Fog. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features show minimal changes (one out of
13), whereas BCEA (9 of 13) and blink features (four of 5) exhibit pronounced
differences, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze
stability and blinking behaviour. In addition to conventional measures such as
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and entropy metrics, a new parameter, Guzik's Index
(GI), is introduced to quantify fixation asymmetry along the major axis of the
BCEA. This index utilizes eye tracking data to enhance the understanding of eye
movement dynamics during driving conditions. Separately from GI, other
parameters elicit the largest deviations compared to Ride (e.g., number of
saccades: Cliff's $\delta$ = 0.96, BCEA: Cohen's $\textit{d}$ = 0.89, and
standard deviation of blink duration: Cliff's $\delta$ = 0.80), underscoring
the influence of reduced visibility on visual attention. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that combining BCEA with saccade and blink parameters
provides a comprehensive understanding of visual attention and gaze stability,
while GI offers additional insights into fixation asymmetry under varying
visibility conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对时间编码机器(TEMs)的非均匀量化(NUQ)方案，通过分析触发间隔的非均匀分布特性，设计基于幂律的NUQ方法，在相同比特预算下显著优于均匀量化(UQ)，且比非均匀采样(NUS)方案传输成本减半。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀量化假设触发间隔均匀分布，但实际TEMs的触发间隔具有非均匀分布特性，这促使研究更适合的非均匀量化方案。

Method: 推导了带限信号触发间隔的概率分布，并设计了一种基于幂律的非均匀量化方案来匹配该分布特性。

Result: 仿真表明NUQ在相同比特预算下显著优于UQ，且TEM-NUQ方案相比NUS方案在传输成本减半的情况下实现更低的误差。

Conclusion: 分布感知的量化方法具有明显优势，TEM-NUQ成为传统UQ和NUS方案的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Time encoding machines (TEMs) provide an event-driven alternative to
classical uniform sampling, enabling power-efficient representations without a
global clock. While prior work analyzed uniform quantization (UQ) of firing
intervals, we show that these intervals are inherently non-uniformly
distributed, motivating the use of non-uniform quantization (NUQ). We derive
the probability distribution of firing intervals for a class of bandlimited
signals and design a power-law-based NUQ scheme tailored to this distribution.
Simulations demonstrate that NUQ significantly outperforms UQ under the same
bit budget. We also compare TEMs with non-uniform sampling (NUS), where both
amplitudes and timings require quantization, and show that TEM--NUQ achieves
lower error at half the transmission cost. These results highlight the
advantages of distribution-aware quantization and establish TEM--NUQ as an
efficient alternative to conventional UQ and NUS schemes.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言学知识的半自动框架，用于评估TTS系统的韵律表现，通过两层架构模拟人类韵律组织，提供客观可解释的韵律评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS系统难以准确捕捉人类韵律变化，现有评估方法如MOS评分资源密集、不一致且无法解释系统为何听起来不自然。

Method: 使用定量语言学标准，在多个声学维度上评估合成语音与人类语音语料库的差异，整合离散和连续韵律测量，考虑说话人和韵律线索的自然变异性。

Result: 结果显示与感知MOS评分有强相关性，同时揭示了传统感知测试无法捕捉的模型特定弱点。

Conclusion: 该方法为诊断、基准测试和最终改进下一代TTS系统的韵律自然度提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: Prosody is essential for speech technology, shaping comprehension,
naturalness, and expressiveness. However, current text-to-speech (TTS) systems
still struggle to accurately capture human-like prosodic variation, in part
because existing evaluation methods for prosody remain limited. Traditional
metrics like Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are resource-intensive, inconsistent, and
offer little insight into why a system sounds unnatural. This study introduces
a linguistically informed, semi-automatic framework for evaluating TTS prosody
through a two-tier architecture that mirrors human prosodic organization. The
method uses quantitative linguistic criteria to evaluate synthesized speech
against human speech corpora across multiple acoustic dimensions. By
integrating discrete and continuous prosodic measures, it provides objective
and interpretable metrics of both event placement and cue realization, while
accounting for the natural variability observed across speakers and prosodic
cues. Results show strong correlations with perceptual MOS ratings while
revealing model-specific weaknesses that traditional perceptual tests alone
cannot capture. This approach provides a principled path toward diagnosing,
benchmarking, and ultimately improving the prosodic naturalness of
next-generation TTS systems.

*Junyi Fan,Donald S. Williamson*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于MUSHRA的方法来研究不同频段对噪声的鲁棒性，发现中频区域在感知语音质量方面对噪声的鲁棒性较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音质量是语音研究的重要指标，但以往研究多关注频段级的语音可懂度，而对语音质量的频段分析不够深入。

Method: 采用MUSHRA启发的方法，将语音信号分为32个频段，在不同信噪比下加入真实噪声，基于人类评分的感知质量计算各频段的噪声鲁棒性指数。

Result: 结果显示中频区域在感知语音质量方面对噪声的鲁棒性较差。

Conclusion: 未来改善语音质量的研究应更多关注语音信号的中频区域。

Abstract: Speech quality is one of the main foci of speech-related research, where it
is frequently studied with speech intelligibility, another essential
measurement. Band-level perceptual speech intelligibility, however, has been
studied frequently, whereas speech quality has not been thoroughly analyzed. In
this paper, a Multiple Stimuli With Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA)
inspired approach was proposed to study the individual robustness of frequency
bands to noise with perceptual speech quality as the measure. Speech signals
were filtered into thirty-two frequency bands with compromising real-world
noise employed at different signal-to-noise ratios. Robustness to noise indices
of individual frequency bands was calculated based on the human-rated
perceptual quality scores assigned to the reconstructed noisy speech signals.
Trends in the results suggest the mid-frequency region appeared less robust to
noise in terms of perceptual speech quality. These findings suggest future
research aiming at improving speech quality should pay more attention to the
mid-frequency region of the speech signals accordingly.

Abstract: Dysarthria is a speech disorder characterized by impaired intelligibility and
reduced communicative effectiveness. Automatic dysarthria assessment provides a
scalable, cost-effective approach for supporting the diagnosis and treatment of
neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
stroke. This study investigates leveraging human perceptual annotations from
speech synthesis assessment as reliable out-of-domain knowledge for dysarthric
speech assessment. Experimental results suggest that such supervision can yield
consistent and substantial performance improvements in self-supervised learning
pre-trained models. These findings suggest that perceptual ratings aligned with
human judgments from speech synthesis evaluations represent valuable resources
for dysarthric speech modeling, enabling effective cross-domain knowledge
transfer.

Abstract: Audio watermarking is a promising tool to ensure authenticity of speech
content. However, existing watermarking methods remain vulnerable to more
advanced dilution attacks such as lossy compression and neural reconstruction.
In this paper, we propose to multiplex neural audio watermarking techniques to
leverage their complementarity under different types of attacks. Specifically,
five different multiplexing designs are investigated, including parallel,
sequential, frequency-division, time-division and perceptual adaptive
time-frequency multiplexing (PA-TFM). We evaluate our multiplexing technique on
LibriSpeech data with 11 different attack methods, including 2 new neural
reconstruction attacks featuring recent advancements in speech processing. As a
result, the proposed PA-TFM as a training-free multiplexing method achieves
better performance than single watermarking baselines by clear margins,
showcasing a more robust way of using watermarks for audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进DF-Conformer架构，消除FAVOR+中的近似误差，同时保持线性计算复杂度，以提升语音增强性能。

Method: 使用Hydra（Mamba的双向扩展）作为结构化矩阵混合器，替代原有的FAVOR+注意力机制。

Result: 在基于离散编解码器token的生成式语音增强模型Genhancer上的实验表明，该方法性能优于DF-Conformer。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功提升了语音增强性能，证明了双向选择性状态空间模型在替代近似注意力机制方面的有效性。

Abstract: The Dilated FAVOR Conformer (DF-Conformer) is an efficient variant of the
Conformer architecture designed for speech enhancement (SE). It employs fast
attention through positive orthogonal random features (FAVOR+) to mitigate the
quadratic complexity associated with self-attention, while utilizing dilated
convolution to expand the receptive field. This combination results in
impressive performance across various SE models. In this paper, we propose
replacing FAVOR+ with bidirectional selective structured state-space sequence
models to achieve two main objectives:(1) enhancing global sequential modeling
by eliminating the approximations inherent in FAVOR+, and (2) maintaining
linear complexity relative to the sequence length. Specifically, we utilize
Hydra, a bidirectional extension of Mamba, framed within the structured matrix
mixer framework. Experiments conducted using a generative SE model on discrete
codec tokens, known as Genhancer, demonstrate that the proposed method
surpasses the performance of the DF-Conformer.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the often-overlooked aspect of perceived voice
femininity in singing voices. While existing research has examined perceived
voice femininity in speech, the same concept has not yet been studied in
singing voice. The analysis of gender bias in music content could benefit from
such study. To address this gap, we design a stimuli-based survey to measure
perceived singing voice femininity (PSVF), and collect responses from 128
participants. Our analysis reveals intriguing insights into how PSVF varies
across different demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose an automatic PSVF
prediction model by fine-tuning an x-vector model, offering a novel tool for
exploring gender stereotypes related to voices in music content analysis beyond
binary sex classification. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of
the complexities surrounding perceived femininity in singing voices by
analyzing survey and proposes an automatic tool for future research.

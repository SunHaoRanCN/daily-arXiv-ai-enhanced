Schizophrenia, a complex disorder with diverse\nsymptoms including disorganized speech and social withdrawal, demands tools\nthat capture symptom severity and provide clinically meaningful insights beyond\nbinary diagnosis. Here, we present an interpretable framework that leverages\narticulatory speech features through eigenspectra difference plots and a\nweighted sum with exponential decay (WSED) to quantify vocal tract\ncoordination. Eigenspectra plots effectively distinguished complex from simpler\ncoordination patterns, and WSED scores reliably separated these groups, with\nambiguity confined to a narrow range near zero. Importantly, WSED scores\ncorrelated not only with overall BPRS severity but also with the balance\nbetween positive and negative symptoms, reflecting more complex coordination in\nsubjects with pronounced positive symptoms and the opposite trend for stronger\nnegative symptoms. This approach offers a transparent, severity-sensitive\nbiomarker for schizophrenia, advancing the potential for clinically\ninterpretable speech-based assessment tools."}

To characterize the impact of Sensing Targets\n(STs), 3GPP defines ISAC channel as a combination of target and background\nchannels, comprising multipath components related to STs and those originating\nsolely from the environment, respectively. Although the background channel does\nnot carry direct ST information, its accurate modeling is critical for\nevaluating sensing performance, especially in complex environments. Existing\ncommunication standards characterize propagation between separated transmitter\n(Tx) and receiver (Rx).

In this paper, we firstly conduct ISAC monostatic background channel\nmeasurements for an indoor scenario at 28 GHz. Realistic channel parameters are\nextracted, revealing pronounced single-hop propagation and discrete multipath\ndistribution. Inspired by these properties, a novel stochastic model is\nproposed to characterizing the ISAC monostatic background channel as the\nsuperposition of sub-channels between the monostatic Tx&Rx and multiple\ncommunication Rx-like Reference Points (RPs).

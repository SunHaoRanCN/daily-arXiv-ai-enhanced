TL;DR: AIRMap是一个基于深度学习的超快速无线电地图估计框架，仅使用2D地形高程图就能在4毫秒内预测路径增益，比GPU加速的射线追踪快7000倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统射线追踪方法计算量大，不适合动态条件下的实时无线网络仿真和数字孪生应用。

Method: 使用U-Net自编码器处理2D地形和建筑高度图，通过6万个波士顿地区样本训练，支持轻量级迁移学习校准。

Result: 预测路径增益的RMSE低于5dB，使用20%现场测量校准后中位误差降至约10%，显著优于传统模拟器50%以上的误差。

Conclusion: AIRMap验证了在无线数字孪生中实现可扩展、准确和实时无线电地图估计的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate, low-latency channel modeling is essential for real-time wireless network simulation and digital-twin applications. Traditional modeling methods like ray tracing are however computationally demanding and unsuited to model dynamic conditions. In this paper, we propose AIRMap, a deep-learning framework for ultra-fast radio-map estimation, along with an automated pipeline for creating the largest radio-map dataset to date. AIRMap uses a single-input U-Net autoencoder that processes only a 2D elevation map of terrain and building heights. Trained and evaluated on 60,000 Boston-area samples, spanning coverage areas from 500 m to 3 km per side, AIRMap predicts path gain with under 5 dB RMSE in 4 ms per inference on an NVIDIA L40S -over 7000x faster than GPU-accelerated ray tracing based radio maps. A lightweight transfer learning calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to approximately 10%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which exceed 50% error. Integration into the Colosseum emulator and the Sionna SYS platform demonstrate near-zero error in spectral efficiency and block-error rate compared to measurement-based channels. These findings validate AIRMap's potential for scalable, accurate, and real-time radio map estimation in wireless digital twins.

Conclusion: 研究展示了一种可靠且透明的基于脑电图的重度抑郁症筛查方法，使用深度学习获得与临床相关的可解释结果。

Abstract: Depression is a major cause of global mental illness and significantly influences suicide rates. Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive and accessible method for examining cerebral activity and identifying disease-associated patterns. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights. These studies highlight features, cerebral areas, and connectivity associations that are especially relevant to MDD, many of which correspond with clinical data. Our findings demonstrate a reliable and transparent method for EEG-based screening of MDD, using deep learning with clinically relevant results.

Conclusion: 该框架在保持实际计算复杂度的同时，对大规模MIMO系统在中高频段具有可行性，且在不同频率和环境间具有鲁棒性，仅需少量微调。

Abstract: Accurate multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation is critical for next-generation wireless systems, enabling enhanced communication and sensing performance. Traditional model-based channel estimation methods suffer, however, from performance degradation in complex environments with a limited number of pilots, while purely data-driven approaches lack physical interpretability, require extensive data collection, and are usually site-specific. This paper presents a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that combines model-based channel estimation with a deep network to exploit prior information about the propagation environment and achieve superior performance under pilot-constrained scenarios. The proposed approach employs an enhanced U-Net architecture with cross-attention mechanisms to fuse initial channel estimates with received signal strength (RSS) maps to provide refined channel estimates. Comprehensive evaluation using realistic ray-tracing data from urban environments demonstrates significant performance improvements, achieving over 5 dB gain in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to state-of-the-art methods, with particularly strong performance in pilot-limited scenarios and robustness across different frequencies and environments with only minimal fine-tuning. The proposed framework maintains practical computational complexity, making it viable for massive MIMO systems in upper mid-band frequencies.

Conclusion: 该两阶段秩感知压缩感知框架能够有效处理毫米波MIMO系统中的快速时变信道估计问题，在动态条件下提供准确且高效的信道重建。

Abstract: We address the problem of fast time-varying channel estimation in millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems with imperfect channel state information (CSI) and facilitate efficient channel reconstruction. Specifically, leveraging the low-rank and sparse characteristics of the mmWave channel matrix, a two-phase rank-aware compressed sensing framework is proposed for efficient channel estimation and reconstruction. In the first phase, a robust rank-one matrix completion (R1MC) algorithm is used to reconstruct part of the observed channel matrix through low-rank matrix completion (LRMC). To address abrupt rank changes caused by user mobility, a discrete-time autoregressive (AR) model is established that leverages temporal rank correlations across consecutive time instances to enable adaptive observation matrix completion, thereby improving estimation accuracy under dynamic conditions. In the second phase, a rank-aware block orthogonal matching pursuit (RA-BOMP) algorithm is developed for sparse channel recovery with low computational complexity. Furthermore, a rank-aware measurement matrix design is introduced to improve angle estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with existing benchmark algorithms, the proposed approach achieves superior channel estimation performance while significantly reducing computational complexity and training overhead.

Conclusion: RadioSim Agent提供了多模态可解释性和直观的用户交互，为下一代无线系统设计中的智能电磁模拟助手铺平了道路。

Abstract: Deterministic electromagnetic (EM) simulators provide accurate radio propagation modeling but often require expert configuration and lack interactive flexibility. We present RadioSim Agent, an agentic framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with physics-based EM solvers and vision-enabled reasoning to enable interactive and explainable radio map generation. The framework encapsulates ray-tracing models as callable simulation tools, orchestrated by an LLM capable of interpreting natural language objectives, managing simulation workflows, and visually analyzing resulting radio maps. Demonstrations in urban UAV communication scenarios show that the agent autonomously selects appropriate propagation mechanisms, executes deterministic simulations, and provides semantic and visual summaries of pathloss behavior. The results indicate that RadioSim Agent provides multimodal interpretability and intuitive user interaction, paving the way for intelligent EM simulation assistants in next-generation wireless system design.

### [6] [Near-field Anchor-free Localization using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05954)

Conclusion: 提出的框架在不需要增加RIS控制开销的情况下，实现了可扩展的无锚点定位，为6G网络应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Near-field localization is expected to play a crucial role in enabling a plethora of applications under the paradigm of 6G networks. The conventional localization methods rely on complex infrastructure for providing cooperative anchor nodes that often contribute to higher network overload and energy consumption. To address this, the passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be leveraged as perfectly synced reference nodes for developing anchor-free localization. This work proposes a two-stage framework for localizing user equipment (UE) equipped with multiple antennas. At first, we show that the optimal RIS phase shift matrix maximizing the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for RIS-assisted anchor-free localization is independent of UE location, making the proposed framework scalable without increasing the overhead to control RIS. The proposed two-stage framework first obtains a coarse estimate of UE's location by correlating the received RIS-reflected signal with a dictionary constructed using line-of-sight (LoS) components at a few reference positions. Next, the coarse estimate is refined using Newton's refinement. The numerical results show that the small-sized dictionary, constructed using fewer reference positions, can be employed for accurate localization with a slight increase in the required number of refinement iterations.

Conclusion: 提出的不变变换方法为多参数估计提供了系统解决方案，兼容实时和在线操作，显著提高了无损检测结果的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: The Buckingham's $π$, theorem has been recently introduced in the context of Non destructive Testing \& Evaluation (NdT\&E) , giving a theoretical basis for developing simple but effective methods for multi-parameter estimation via dimensional analysis. Dimensional groups, or $π-$groups, allow for the reduction of the number of parameters affecting the dimensionless measured quantities.
  In many real-world applications, the main interest is in estimating only a subset of the variables affecting the measurements. An example is estimating the thickness and electrical conductivity of a plate from Eddy Current Testing data, regardless of the lift-off of the probe, which may be either uncertain and/or variable. Alternatively, one may seek to estimate thickness and lift-off while neglecting the influence of the electrical conductivity, or to estimate the electrical conductivity and the lift-off, neglecting the thickness.
  This is where the concept of invariants becomes crucial. An invariant transformation is a mathematical mapping that makes the measured signal independent of one or more of these uncertain parameters. Invariant transformations provide a way to isolate useful signals from uncertain ones, improving the accuracy and reliability of the NdT results.
  The main contribution of this paper is a systematic method to derive \emph{invariant} transformations for frequency domain Eddy Current Testing data, via dimensional analysis. The proposed method is compatible with real-time and in-line operations.
  After its theoretical foundation is introduced, the method is validated by means of experimental data, with reference to configurations consisting of plates with different thicknesses, electrical conductivity, and lift-off. The experimental validation proves the effectiveness of the method in achieving excellent accuracy on a wide range of parameters of interest.

Abstract: The current body of research on Parkinson's disease (PD) screening, monitoring, and management has evolved along two largely independent trajectories. The first research community focuses on multimodal sensing of PD-related biomarkers using noninvasive technologies such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), force/pressure insoles, electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), speech and acoustic analysis, and RGB/RGB-D motion capture systems. These studies emphasize data acquisition, feature extraction, and machine learning-based classification for PD screening, diagnosis, and disease progression modeling. In parallel, a second research community has concentrated on robotic intervention and rehabilitation, employing socially assistive robots (SARs), robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) systems, and virtual reality (VR)-integrated robotic platforms for improving motor and cognitive function, enhancing social engagement, and supporting caregivers. Despite the complementary goals of these two domains, their methodological and technological integration remains limited, with minimal data-level or decision-level coupling between the two. With the advent of advanced artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, a unique opportunity now exists to unify these research streams. We envision a closed-loop sensor-AI-robot framework in which multimodal sensing continuously guides the interaction between the patient, caregiver, humanoid robot (and physician) through AI agents that are powered by a multitude of AI models such as robotic and wearables foundation models, LLM-based reasoning, reinforcement learning, and continual learning. Such closed-loop system enables personalized, explainable, and context-aware intervention, forming the basis for digital twin of the PD patient that can adapt over time to deliver intelligent, patient-centered PD care.

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯在线学习框架为DNN接收器提供了快速、低复杂度的适应能力，优于传统的梯度下降方法。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based receivers offer a powerful alternative to classical model-based designs for wireless communication, especially in complex and nonlinear propagation environments. However, their adoption is challenged by the rapid variability of wireless channels, which makes pre-trained static DNN-based receivers ineffective, and by the latency and computational burden of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based learning. In this work, we propose an online learning framework that enables rapid low-complexity adaptation of DNN-based receivers. Our approach is based on two main tenets. First, we cast online learning as Bayesian tracking in parameter space, enabling a single-step adaptation, which deviates from multi-epoch SGD . Second, we focus on modular DNN architectures that enable parallel, online, and localized variational Bayesian updates. Simulations with practical communication channels demonstrate that our proposed online learning framework can maintain a low error rate with markedly reduced update latency and increased robustness to channel dynamics as compared to traditional gradient descent based method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地球轨道卫星虽然有望替代全球导航卫星系统进行精确定位，但其较低的轨道高度使其更容易受到轨道扰动影响，从而降低定位精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的两阶段定位方法能有效应对轨道误差，显著提升低地球轨道卫星的定位性能。

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites offer a promising alternative to global navigation satellite systems for precise positioning; however, their relatively low altitudes make them more susceptible to orbital perturbations, which in turn degrade positioning accuracy. In this work, we study LEO-based positioning under orbital errors within a signal-of-opportunity framework. First, we introduce a LEO orbit model that accounts for Earth's non-sphericity and derive a wideband communication model that captures fast- and slow-time Doppler effects and multipath propagation. Subsequently, we perform a misspecified Cramér-Rao bound (MCRB) analysis to evaluate the impact of orbital errors on positioning performance. Then, we propose a two-stage positioning method starting with a (i) MCRB-based weighted orbit calibration, followed by (ii) least-squares user positioning using the corrected orbit. The MCRB analysis indicates that orbital errors can induce kilometer-level position biases. Extensive simulations show that the proposed estimator can considerably enhance the positioning accuracy relative to the orbit-mismatched baseline, yielding errors on the order of a few meters.

*Liyang Lu,Haochen Wu,Wenbo Xu,Zhaocheng Wang,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于先验支撑信息(PSI)的层次压缩感知(HCS)的新恢复边界，设计了HiBOMP-P算法，推导了基于互不相干性(MIP)的精确恢复条件，并证明HCS在PSI与真实支撑集不重叠时仍能提升恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于PSI的压缩感知方法严重依赖先验信息与真实支撑集的重叠，当这种重叠不存在时性能会下降。本文旨在开发即使在PSI与真实支撑集不重叠时也能提升恢复性能的HCS方法。

Method: 提出了详细的PSI重建模型，设计了递归形式的层次块正交匹配追踪算法(HiBOMP-P)，推导了基于互不相干性(MIP)的精确恢复条件，并提出了层次MIP概念和可重构稀疏度水平。

Result: 证明了HCS即使在先验信息与真实支撑集不重叠时也能提供改进的恢复性能，而现有方法严重依赖这种重叠。推导了噪声场景下的可靠恢复条件和非零稀疏度情况下的最优层次结构。

Conclusion: 层次压缩感知(HCS)相比现有方法具有更强的鲁棒性，即使在没有先验信息与真实支撑集重叠的情况下仍能保持较好的恢复性能，这为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We provide new recovery bounds for hierarchical compressed sensing (HCS) based on prior support information (PSI). A detailed PSI-enabled reconstruction model is formulated using various forms of PSI. The hierarchical block orthogonal matching pursuit with PSI (HiBOMP-P) algorithm is designed in a recursive form to reliably recover hierarchically block-sparse signals. We derive exact recovery conditions (ERCs) measured by the mutual incoherence property (MIP), wherein hierarchical MIP concepts are proposed, and further develop reconstructible sparsity levels to reveal sufficient conditions for ERCs. Leveraging these MIP analyses, we present several extended insights, including reliable recovery conditions in noisy scenarios and the optimal hierarchical structure for cases where sparsity is not equal to zero. Our results further confirm that HCS offers improved recovery performance even when the prior information does not overlap with the true support set, whereas existing methods heavily rely on this overlap, thereby compromising performance if it is absent.

Conclusion: 该框架为动态无线环境提供了高效的生成AI解决方案，可扩展到其他移动无线系统

Abstract: In our prior work we have proposed the use of GFlowNets, a generative AI (GenAI) framework, for designing a secure communication system comprising a time-modulated intelligent reflecting surface (TM-IRS). However, GFlowNet-based approaches assume static environments, limiting their applicability in mobile wireless networks. In this paper, we proposes a novel Meta-GFlowNet framework that achieves rapid adaptation to dynamic conditions using model-agnostic meta-learning. As the communication user is moving, the framework learns a direction-general prior across user directions via inner trajectory-balance updates and outer meta-updates, enabling quick convergence to new user directions. The approach requires no labeled data, employing a pseudo-supervised consistency objective derived from the learned reward by GFlowNet and the actual sum-rate reward of the TM-IRS system. Simulation results show that the proposed method attains faster adaptation and higher secrecy performance than retrained GFlowNets, offering an efficient GenAI framework for dynamic wireless environments. Although the scenario considered here focuses on directional modulation-based physical-layer security, the proposed framework can also be applied to other mobile wireless systems, such as joint sensing-communication networks, that utilize GFlowNets.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Mobile-GRAPPA是一种k空间"清理"方法，使用局部GRAPPA算子去除运动和dB0相关伪影，使数据能够用标准SENSE重建，避免了计算昂贵的Aligned-SENSE方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动导航技术能够快速跟踪运动和dB0诱导相位，但将这些高时间分辨率信息准确整合到SENSE重建中计算成本过高。

Method: 通过轻量级多层感知器(MLP)高效训练一系列k空间位置特定的Mobile-GRAPPA核，并在整个k空间应用这些核来生成干净数据。

Result: 在高度运动损坏的1mm全脑GRE和EPTI实验中，Mobile-GRAPPA实现了准确重建且时间开销可忽略，而完整Aligned-SENSE重建时间过长（GRE>10小时，EPTI>10天）。

Conclusion: Mobile-GRAPPA能够以最小计算开销将详细运动和dB0跟踪整合到SENSE中，实现对挑战性数据的快速高质量重建。

Abstract: Advanced motion navigations now enable rapid tracking of subject motion and dB0-induced phase, but accurately incorporating this high-temporal-resolution information into SENSE (Aligned-SENSE) is often computationally prohibitive. We propose "Mobile-GRAPPA", a k-space "cleaning" approach that uses local GRAPPA operators to remove motion and dB0 related corruption so that the resulting data can be reconstructed with standard SENSE. We efficiently train a family of k-space-position-specific Mobile-GRAPPA kernels via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) and apply them across k-space to generate clean data. In experiments on highly motion-corrupted 1-mm whole-brain GRE (Tacq = 10 min; 1,620 motion/dB0 trackings) and EPTI (Tacq = 2 min; 544 trackings), Mobile-GRAPPA enabled accurate reconstruction with negligible time penalty, whereas full Aligned-SENSE was impractical (reconstruction times > 10 h for GRE and > 10 days for EPTI). These results show that Mobile-GRAPPA incorporates detailed motion and dB0 tracking into SENSE with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast, high-quality reconstructions of challenging data.

Abstract: This paper proposes a blocker-aware multicarrier integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-non orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, leveraging hybrid beamforming and dynamic power allocation to enhance spectrum efficiency in 6G networks. Recognizing the performance degradation caused by environmental blockers, the system introduces a joint waveform design that ensures robust operation under varying channel conditions. A channel switching mechanism is deployed to reroute communication through alternative non-line-of-sight paths when the primary line-of-sight links are obstructed. Moreover, a dynamic power allocation strategy enforces a minimum rate constraint for the weak NOMA user, ensuring consistent quality of service. Extensive simulations over multiple blockage scenarios and signal to noise (SNR) conditions validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Notably, under severe blockage, the system achieves up to a 400% sensing rate enhancement at 15 dB SNR, with only a 20% reduction in communication rate. These results corroborate the system's ability to adapt and optimize joint sensing-communication performance in practical deployment environments.

Abstract: Balancing throughput and fairness promises to be a key enabler for achieving large-scale digital inclusion in future vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets). In an attempt to address the global digital divide problem, this paper explores a multi-high-altitude platform system (HAPS)-ground integrated network, in which multiple HAPSs collaborate with ground base stations (BSs) to enhance the users' quality of service on the ground to achieve the highly sought-after digital equity. To this end, this paper considers maximizing both the network-wide weighted sum rate function and the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) function subject to the same system level constraints. More specifically, the paper tackles the two different optimization problems so as to balance throughput and fairness, by accounting for the individual HAPS payload connectivity constraints, HAPS and BS distinct power limitations, and per-user rate requirements. This paper solves the considered problems using techniques from optimization theory by adopting a generalized assignment problem (GAP)-based methodology to determine the user association variables, jointly with successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithms for optimizing the corresponding beamforming vectors. One of the main advantages of the proposed algorithms is their amenability for distributed implementation across the multiple HAPSs and BSs. The simulation results particularly validate the performance of the presented algorithms, demonstrating the capability of multi-HAPS networks to boost-up the overall network digital inclusion toward democratizing future digital services.

Abstract: The increasing saturation of terrestrial resources has driven economic activities into low-altitude airspace. These activities, such as air taxis, rely on low-altitude wireless networks, and one key enabling technology is integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, in low-altitude airspace, ISAC is vulnerable to channel-access attacks, thereby degrading performance and threatening safety. To address this, we propose a defense framework based on a Stackelberg game. Specifically, we first model the system under attack, deriving metrics for the communication and the sensing to quantify performance. Then, we formulate the interaction as a three-player game where a malicious attacker acts as the leader, while the legitimate drone and ground base station act as followers. Using a backward induction algorithm, we obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium, allowing the defenders to dynamically adjust their strategies to mitigate the attack. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm converges to a stable solution and outperforms existing baselines, ensuring reliable ISAC performance for critical low-altitude applications.

Conclusion: CF-MGM方案有效解决了毫米波系统中多组多播传输的复杂度和开销问题，无需复杂CSIT获取即可实现高性能传输

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the downlink multi-group multicast (MGM) transmission problem in overloaded mmWave systems. In particular, the conventional MGM beamforming requires substantial computational complexity and feedback (or pilot) overhead for acquisition of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), while simultaneous interference management and multicast beamforming optimization across multi-group inevitably incurs a significant rate loss. To address this, we propose a CSIT-free MGM (CF-MGM) transmission that eliminates the need for a complex CSIT acquisition. A deterministic CSIT-free precoding and proposed closed-form power allocation based on max-min fairness (MMF) allow each user to detect the common multicast stream completely canceling the inter-group interference with a significantly low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority and scalability of the proposed CF-MGM for the achievable rate and increase of users in a group outperforming the existing CSIT-based methods.

Conclusion: 模块化线性阵列的预测波束成形在目标跟踪中能够保持高定位精度，模块间距设计可以优化横向速度估计性能。

Abstract: Velocity estimation is a cornerstone of recently introduced near-field predictive beamforming. This paper derives the closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint velocity estimation using a modular linear array (MLA) within a predictive-beamforming framework. The analysis shows that increasing inter-module separation enlarges the effective aperture and reduces the transverse-velocity CRB, whereas the radial-velocity CRB is largely insensitive to separation. We further obtain a simple closed-form relation linking the achievable antenna savings to the inter-module separation while preserving the same transverse accuracy of a uniform linear array (ULA). We further investigate how velocity mismatch affects array gain and show that transverse-velocity errors cause more severe performance degradation than radial-velocity errors. Simulations show that predictive beamforming with MLAs maintains high localization accuracy for target tracking.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to assist covert communication between a low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite and a ground user under the surveillance of a passive warden. The UAV simultaneously serves its own ground network and acts as a friendly jammer to enhance the covertness of satellite transmissions. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the warden's average minimum detection error probability which is then used to define the covert constraint. Building on this, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the UAV's 3D placement, its power allocation, and the satellite's transmit power to maximize the system's covert rate. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we propose an algorithm based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, and further develop a Dinkelbach's algorithm for a special case. Numerical results validate the tightness of the derived bound and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in configuring optimal system parameters.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the 3D positioning capabilities of users in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike previous studies that mainly rely on idealized isotropic antenna models, we adopt a polarimetric model that takes advantage of effective aperture distribution functions to characterize realistic antenna patterns, placements, and polarization effects. Based on this model, we analyze the fundamental limits of UE positioning using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB). The FIM is shown to be expressed as a weighted sum of the information contributions from individual access point (AP)-UE pairs, with each contribution interpreted geometrically across distance, azimuth, and elevation dimensions. The impact of the UE tilt and the spatial distribution of APs on the PEBs is further analyzed. As a further advancement, we propose a complete positioning framework from a UE tracking perspective. By integrating a global probability hypothesis density filter and a PEB-aware AP management strategy, the framework enables accurate tracking while optimizing AP scheduling. Finally, we present a distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate a centimeter-level tracking accuracy. In addition, the PEB-aware AP management strategy is shown to maintain robust tracking performance while significantly reducing the number of concurrently active APs, thus lowering the overall system overhead.

Conclusion: SaPINNs框架通过整合物理约束和频谱先验，显著提高了自然激励下系统辨识的性能，能够提供具有实际不确定性水平的物理一致估计。

Abstract: System identification under unknown external excitation is an inherently ill-posed problem, typically requiring additional knowledge or simplifying assumptions to enable reliable state and parameter estimation. The difficulty of the problem is further amplified in structural systems subjected to natural hazards such as earthquakes or windstorms, where responses are often highly transient, nonlinear, and spatially distributed. To address this challenge, we introduce Spectrum and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SaPINNs) for efficient input--state--parameter estimation in systems under complex excitations characteristic of natural hazards. The proposed model enhances the neural network with governing physics of the system dynamics and incorporates spectral information of natural hazards by using empirically derived spectra as priors on the unknown excitations. This integration improves inference of unmeasured inputs, system states, and parameters without imposing restrictive assumptions on their dynamics. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated through comparative studies on both linear and nonlinear systems under various types of excitation, including the El Centro earthquake, where the seismic spectrum is assumed to be not precisely known. To account for predictive uncertainty, the proposed architecture is embedded within a Deep Ensemble (DEns) networks architecture, providing distributions over possible solutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional PINNs, as the incorporation of spectral information introduces an inductive bias that guides the network more effectively through the solution space and enhances its ability to recover physically consistent state and parameter estimates with realistic uncertainty levels.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel structure-aware matrix completion framework assisted by radial basis function (RBF) interpolation for near-field radio map construction in extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. Unlike the far-field scenario, near-field wavefronts exhibit strong dependencies on both angle and distance due to spherical wave propagation, leading to complicated variations in received signal strength (RSS). To effectively capture the intricate spatial variations structure inherent in near-field environments, a regularized RBF interpolation method is developed to enhance radio map reconstruction accuracy. Leveraging theoretical insights from interpolation error analysis of RBF, an inverse μ-law-inspired nonuniform sampling strategy is introduced to allocate measurements adaptively, emphasizing regions with rapid RSS variations near the transmitter. To further exploit the global low-rank structure in the near-field radio map, we integrate RBF interpolation with nuclear norm minimization (NNM)-based matrix completion. A robust Huberized leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme is then proposed for adaptive selection of the tolerance parameter, facilitating optimal fusion between RBF interpolation and matrix completion. The integration of local variation structure modeling via RBF interpolation and global low-rank structure exploitation via matrix completion yields a structure-aware framework that substantially improves the accuracy of near-field radio map reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 10% improvement in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to standard interpolation and matrix completion methods under varying sampling densities and shadowing conditions.

Abstract: Future Internet-of-Things networks are envisioned to use small and cheap sensor nodes with extremely low power consumption to avoid the extensive use of batteries. To provide connectivity to a massive number of these nodes, backscatter communication (BC) is emerging as an energy- and cost-efficient technology exploiting the reflection of radio frequency signals. However, challenges such as round-trip path loss and direct link interference (DLI) between the carrier emitter and the reader limit its performance. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a joint access point role selection and a novel beamforming technique for bistatic BC in a distributed multiple-input multiple- output setup. The proposed approach boosts the received backscattered energy while effectively mitigating DLI, thereby reducing the error probability. We also propose a channel estimation method tailored to operate under DLI conditions and propose a mismatch detector using estimated channel coefficients. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability of error for the detectors and model the quantization noise caused by DLI. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed method with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) effectively mitigates DLI, reduces the quantization noise, and enhances backscattered signal energy, achieving performance comparable to the benchmark scenario with 8-bit ADCs.

Abstract: Fleets of autonomous vehicles (AV) often are at the core of intelligent transportation scenarios for smart cities, and may require a wireless Internet connection to offload computer vision tasks to data centers located either in the edge or the cloud section of the network. Cooperation among AVs is successful when the environment is unknown, or changes dynamically, so as to improve coverage and trip time, and minimize the traveled distance. The AVs, while mapping the environment with range-based sensors, move across the wireless coverage areas, with consequences on the achieved access bit rate, latency, and handover rate. In this paper, we propose to modify the cost of path planning algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*, so that not only the traveled distance is considered in the best path solution, but also the radio coverage experience. To this aim, several radio-related cost-weighting functions are introduced and tested, to assess the performance of the proposed techniques with extensive simulations. The proposed mapping algorithm can achieve a mapping error probability below 2%, while the proposed path-planning algorithms extend the experienced radio coverage of the AVs, with limited distance increase with respect to shortest-path existing methods, such as conventional Dijkstra and A* algorithms.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems demand precise and efficient target localization, a task challenged by rich multipath propagation in complex wireless environments. This paper introduces MARBLE-Net (Multipath-Aware Rainbow Beam Learning Network), a deep learning framework that jointly optimizes the analog beamforming parameters of a frequency-dependent rainbow beam and a neural localization network for high-accuracy position estimation. By treating the phase-shifter (PS) and true-time-delay (TTD) parameters as learnable weights, the system adaptively refines its sensing beam to exploit environment-specific multipath characteristics. A structured multi-stage training strategy is proposed to ensure stable convergence and effective end-to-end optimization. Simulation results show that MARBLE-Net outperforms both a fixed-beam deep learning baseline (RaiNet) and a traditional k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, reducing localization error by more than 50\% in a multipath-rich scene. Moreover, the results reveal a nuanced interaction with multipath propagation: while confined uni-directional multipath degrades accuracy, structured and directional multipath can be effectively exploited to achieve performance surpassing even line-of-sight (LoS) conditions.

Abstract: The proliferation of wireless devices necessitates more robust and reliable emitter detection and identification for critical tasks such as spectrum management and network security. Existing studies exploring methods for unknown emitters identification, however, are typically hindered by their dependence on labeled or proprietary datasets, unrealistic assumptions (e.g. all samples with identical transmitted messages), or deficiency of systematic evaluations across different architectures and design dimensions. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of unknown emitter detection systems across key aspects of the design space, focusing on data modality, learning approaches, and feature learn- ing modules. We demonstrate that prior self-supervised, zero-shot emitter detection approaches commonly use datasets with identical transmitted messages. To address this limitation, we propose a 2D- Constellation data modality for scenarios with varying messages, achieving up to a 40\% performance improvement in ROC-AUC, NMI, and F1 metrics compared to conventional raw I/Q data. Furthermore, we introduce interpretable Kolmogorov--Arnold Net- works (KANs) to enhance model transparency, and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based initialization procedure for feature learning modules operating on sparse 2D-Constellation data, which improves the performance of Deep Clustering approaches by up to 40\% across the same metrics comparing to the modules without SVD initialization. We evaluate all data modalities and learning modules across three learning approaches: Deep Clustering, Auto Encoder and Contrastive Learning.

Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly emerging as a key driver of innovation, encompassing economic activities taking place in airspace below 500 meters. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide valuable tools for logistics collection within LAE systems, offering the ability to navigate through complex environments, avoid obstacles, and improve operational efficiency. However, logistics collection tasks involve UAVs flying through complex three-dimensional (3D) environments while avoiding obstacles, where traditional UAV trajectory design methods,typically developed under free-space conditions without explicitly accounting for obstacles, are not applicable. This paper presents, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) methods to minimize the total collection time. Specifically, the LKH algorithm determines the optimal order of item collection, while the DDPG algorithm designs the flight trajectory between collection points. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed LKH-DDPG algorithm significantly reduces collection time by approximately 49 percent compared to baseline approaches, thereby highlighting its effectiveness in optimizing UAV trajectories and enhancing operational efficiency for logistics collection tasks in the LAE paradigm.

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient delivery of common content to multiple user equipments (UEs) has motivated significant research in physical-layer multicasting. By exploiting the beamforming capabilities of massive MIMO, multicasting provides a spectrum-efficient solution that avoids unnecessary intra-group interference. A key challenge, however, is solving the max-min fair (MMF) and quality-of-service (QoS) multicast beamforming optimization problems, which are NP-hard due to the non-convex structure and the requirement for rank-1 solutions. Traditional approaches based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) followed by randomization exhibit poor scalability with system size, while state-of-the-art successive convex approximation (SCA) methods only guarantee convergence to stationary points. In this paper, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based framework for MMF and QoS multicast beamforming in cell-free massive MIMO networks. The algorithm leverages SDR but incorporates a novel iterative elimination strategy within the ADMM updates to efficiently obtain near-global optimal rank-1 beamforming solutions with reduced computational complexity compared to standard SDP solvers and randomization methods. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ADMM-based procedure not only achieves superior spectral efficiency but also scales favorably with the number of antennas and UEs compared to state-of-the-art SCA-based algorithms, making it a practical tool for next-generation multicast systems.

*Jiewei Feng,Ken R. Duffy,Muriel Médard*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: ORBGRAND-AI被集成到猜测码字解码(GCD)中作为模式生成器，通过利用信道相关性，在减少查询模式数量的同时，实现了更好的块错误率(BLER)性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的软判决解码器通常假设信道中的比特是独立受影响的，但ORBGRAND-AI方法证明可以利用信道相关性来提高解码精度。本文旨在将ORBGRAND-AI作为模式生成器集成到GCD中，进一步优化解码性能。

Method: 首先采用直接方法将ORBGRAND-AI集成到GCD中，然后开发更细致的方法利用总相关性(total correlation)来进一步改进解码性能。

Result: 直接方法相比ORBGRAND-AI在BLER上略有下降但查询模式数量减少；更细致的方法能够额外提供约0.75 dB的BLER改进，同时保持减少的查询数量。

Conclusion: 通过将ORBGRAND-AI作为模式生成器集成到GCD中，并利用信道相关性，可以在减少计算复杂度的同时显著提高解码性能。

Abstract: There have been significant advances in recent years in the development of forward error correction decoders that can decode codes of any structure, including practical realizations in synthesized circuits and taped out chips. While essentially all soft-decision decoders assume that bits have been impacted independently on the channel, for one of these new approaches it has been established that channel dependencies can be exploited to achieve superior decoding accuracy, resulting in Ordered Reliability Bits Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding Approximate Independence (ORBGRAND-AI). Building on that capability, here we consider the integration of ORBGRAND-AI as a pattern generator for Guessing Codeword Decoding (GCD). We first establish that a direct approach delivers mildly degraded block error rate (BLER) but with reduced number of queried patterns when compared to ORBGRAND-AI. We then show that with a more nuanced approach it is possible to leverage total correlation to deliver an additional BLER improvement of around 0.75 dB while retaining reduced query numbers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型主要处理单声道输入，缺乏捕捉方向、高度、距离等空间线索的能力，限制了真实声学场景的准确理解

Method: 1) FOA编码器将(W,X,Y,Z)声道映射为旋转感知的听者中心空间特征；2) SPUR-Set空间问答数据集结合开源FOA录音和受控模拟；3) 通过多模态适配器集成到目标模型中

Result: 在SPUR-Set上微调模型能持续改进空间问答和多说话人归因能力，同时保持通用音频理解能力

Conclusion: SPUR提供了一个简单的方法将单声道LALMs转换为具有空间感知能力的模型，消融实验验证了方法的有效性

Abstract: Spatial perception is central to auditory intelligence, enabling accurate understanding of real-world acoustic scenes and advancing human-level perception of the world around us. While recent large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong reasoning over complex audios, most operate on monaural inputs and lack the ability to capture spatial cues such as direction, elevation, and distance. We introduce SPUR, a lightweight, plug-in approach that equips LALMs with spatial perception through minimal architectural changes. SPUR consists of: (i) a First-Order Ambisonics (FOA) encoder that maps (W, X, Y, Z) channels to rotation-aware, listener-centric spatial features, integrated into target LALMs via a multimodal adapter; and (ii) SPUR-Set, a spatial QA dataset combining open-source FOA recordings with controlled simulations, emphasizing relative direction, elevation, distance, and overlap for supervised spatial reasoning. Fine-tuning our model on the SPUR-Set consistently improves spatial QA and multi-speaker attribution while preserving general audio understanding. SPUR provides a simple recipe that transforms monaural LALMs into spatially aware models. Extensive ablations validate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: Omni-AVSR是一个统一的多模态语音识别框架，能够同时处理听觉语音识别(ASR)、视觉语音识别(VSR)和视听语音识别(AVSR)，通过多粒度训练和参数高效适配实现弹性推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的方法通常独立处理每个任务，训练单独模型导致计算和部署资源使用增加，且缺乏跨任务协同效应。固定速率token压缩限制了准确性与效率的平衡灵活性。

Method: 采用matryoshka表示学习范式在多粒度音频和视觉上进行高效训练，减少训练资源使用；探索三种基于LoRA的策略来适配骨干LLM，平衡共享和任务特定专业化。

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3数据集上的实验表明，Omni-AVSR达到与最先进基线相当或更优的准确率，同时以显著更低的训练和部署资源训练单个模型，在声学噪声下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Omni-AVSR提供了一个统一的音频-视觉LLM框架，支持ASR、VSR和AVSR任务，实现了性能与效率的良好权衡，并分析了LLM规模增加时的扩展行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in speech recognition across multiple modalities, including Auditory Speech Recognition (ASR), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.

*Chenpei Huang,Lingfeng Yao,Kyu In Lee,Lan Emily Zhang,Xun Chen,Miao Pan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: EchoMark是一个基于深度学习的声学环境匹配框架，通过嵌入水印生成感知相似的房间脉冲响应，既能实现高质量环境转换，又能确保可靠的水印恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决声学环境匹配技术可能被恶意使用的安全问题，如高级语音欺骗攻击或破坏录音证据的真实性。

Method: 在潜在域操作以应对RIR的可变特性，通过联合优化感知损失和水印检测损失来训练模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，EchoMark达到与最先进RIR估计器FiNS相当的房间声学参数匹配性能，MOS得分4.22/5，水印检测准确率超过99%，误码率低于0.3%。

Conclusion: EchoMark在保持感知质量的同时实现了可靠的水印嵌入，为声学环境匹配提供了安全解决方案。

Abstract: Acoustic Environment Matching (AEM) is the task of transferring clean audio into a target acoustic environment, enabling engaging applications such as audio dubbing and auditory immersive virtual reality (VR). Recovering similar room impulse response (RIR) directly from reverberant speech offers more accessible and flexible AEM solution. However, this capability also introduces vulnerabilities of arbitrary ``relocation" if misused by malicious user, such as facilitating advanced voice spoofing attacks or undermining the authenticity of recorded evidence. To address this issue, we propose EchoMark, the first deep learning-based AEM framework that generates perceptually similar RIRs with embedded watermark. Our design tackle the challenges posed by variable RIR characteristics, such as different durations and energy decays, by operating in the latent domain. By jointly optimizing the model with a perceptual loss for RIR reconstruction and a loss for watermark detection, EchoMark achieves both high-quality environment transfer and reliable watermark recovery. Experiments on diverse datasets validate that EchoMark achieves room acoustic parameter matching performance comparable to FiNS, the state-of-the-art RIR estimator. Furthermore, a high Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.22 out of 5, watermark detection accuracy exceeding 99\%, and bit error rates (BER) below 0.3\% collectively demonstrate the effectiveness of EchoMark in preserving perceptual quality while ensuring reliable watermark embedding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本和视觉领域取得进展，但在音频推理方面仍有局限。现有方法依赖难以解释的密集音频嵌入，在结构化推理任务中经常失败。

Method: 基于字幕的范式，将音频转换为语音、声音事件和音乐的结构化、人类可读特征，支持推理和透明错误分析。

Result: 在MMAU、MMAR和OmniBench三个基准测试中取得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: SAR-LM通过符号化输入实现了竞争性性能，同时将可解释性作为主要贡献，能够追踪失败到具体特征。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced in text and vision, but their reasoning on audio remains limited. Most existing methods rely on dense audio embeddings, which are difficult to interpret and often fail on structured reasoning tasks. Caption-based approaches, introduced in recent benchmarks such as MMAU, improve performance by translating audio into text, yet still depend on dense embeddings as input, offering little insight when models fail.
  We present SAR-LM, a symbolic audio reasoning pipeline that builds on this caption-based paradigm by converting audio into structured, human-readable features across speech, sound events, and music. These symbolic inputs support both reasoning and transparent error analysis, enabling us to trace failures to specific features. Across three benchmarks, MMAU, MMAR, and OmniBench, SAR-LM achieves competitive results, while prioritizing interpretability as its primary contribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CA-SDR指标在比较S5系统时存在不足，特别是在处理分类错误和交叉污染的情况下无法准确反映系统性能。

Method: 首先比较CA-SDR与经典SDR在仅有分类错误场景下的表现，分析指标局限性，然后提出改进的CA-SDR版本，先关注类别无关SDR，再考虑错误标记源，最后引入惩罚机制。

Result: 研究发现原始CA-SDR在某些情况下无法正确比较系统性能，改进版本能更好地处理分类错误和交叉污染问题。

Conclusion: 提出的改进CA-SDR指标和惩罚机制能更准确地评估S5系统的性能，特别是在处理错误标记和交叉污染时表现更好。

Abstract: Spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) consists of jointly performing audio source separation and sound event classification from a multichannel audio mixture. To evaluate S5 systems, one can consider two individual metrics, i.e., one for source separation and another for sound event classification, but this approach makes it challenging to compare S5 systems. Thus, a joint class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio (CA-SDR) metric was proposed to evaluate S5 systems. In this work, we first compare the CA-SDR with the classical SDR on scenarios with only classification errors. We then analyze the cases where the metric might not allow proper comparison of the systems. To address this problem, we propose a modified version of the CA-SDR which first focuses on class-agnostic SDR and then accounts for the wrongly labeled sources. We also analyze the performance of the two metrics under cross-contamination between separated audio sources. Finally, we propose a first set of penalties in an attempt to make the metric more reflective of the labeling and separation errors.

Conclusion: E2E-VGuard为新兴的LLM语音合成和ASR驱动端到端攻击提供了有效的主动防御解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech synthesis technology have enriched our daily lives, with high-quality and human-like audio widely adopted across real-world applications. However, malicious exploitation like voice-cloning fraud poses severe security risks. Existing defense techniques struggle to address the production large language model (LLM)-based speech synthesis. While previous studies have considered the protection for fine-tuning synthesizers, they assume manually annotated transcripts. Given the labor intensity of manual annotation, end-to-end (E2E) systems leveraging automatic speech recognition (ASR) to generate transcripts are becoming increasingly prevalent, e.g., voice cloning via commercial APIs. Therefore, this E2E speech synthesis also requires new security mechanisms. To tackle these challenges, we propose E2E-VGuard, a proactive defense framework for two emerging threats: (1) production LLM-based speech synthesis, and (2) the novel attack arising from ASR-driven E2E scenarios. Specifically, we employ the encoder ensemble with a feature extractor to protect timbre, while ASR-targeted adversarial examples disrupt pronunciation. Moreover, we incorporate the psychoacoustic model to ensure perturbative imperceptibility. For a comprehensive evaluation, we test 16 open-source synthesizers and 3 commercial APIs across Chinese and English datasets, confirming E2E-VGuard's effectiveness in timbre and pronunciation protection. Real-world deployment validation is also conducted. Our code and demo page are available at https://wxzyd123.github.io/e2e-vguard/.

Conclusion: BridgeVoC通过将声码器任务重新定义为音频恢复问题，结合Schrodinger桥框架和子带感知设计，实现了高效高质量的语音合成，为扩散声码器提供了新的视角。

Abstract: This paper revisits the neural vocoder task through the lens of audio restoration and propose a novel diffusion vocoder called BridgeVoC. Specifically, by rank analysis, we compare the rank characteristics of Mel-spectrum with other common acoustic degradation factors, and cast the vocoder task as a specialized case of audio restoration, where the range-space spectral (RSS) surrogate of the target spectrum acts as the degraded input. Based on that, we introduce the Schrodinger bridge framework for diffusion modeling, which defines the RSS and target spectrum as dual endpoints of the stochastic generation trajectory. Further, to fully utilize the hierarchical prior of subbands in the time-frequency (T-F) domain, we elaborately devise a novel subband-aware convolutional diffusion network as the data predictor, where subbands are divided following an uneven strategy, and convolutional-style attention module is employed with large kernels for efficient T-F contextual modeling. To enable single-step inference, we propose an omnidirectional distillation loss to facilitate effective information transfer from the teacher model to the student model, and the performance is improved by combining target-related and bijective consistency losses. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on various benchmarks and out-of-distribution datasets. Quantitative and qualitative results show that while enjoying fewer parameters, lower computational cost, and competitive inference speed, the proposed BridgeVoC yields stateof-the-art performance over existing advanced GAN-, DDPMand flow-matching-based baselines with only 4 sampling steps. And consistent superiority is still achieved with single-step inference.

Abstract: Voice conversion models modify timbre while preserving paralinguistic features, enabling applications like dubbing and identity protection. However, most VC systems require access to target utterances, limiting their use when target data is unavailable or when users desire conversion to entirely novel, unseen voices. To address this, we introduce a lightweight method SpeakerVAE to generate novel speakers for VC. Our approach uses a deep hierarchical variational autoencoder to model the speaker timbre space. By sampling from the trained model, we generate novel speaker representations for voice synthesis in a VC pipeline. The proposed method is a flexible plug-in module compatible with various VC models, without co-training or fine-tuning of the base VC system. We evaluated our approach with state-of-the-art VC models: FACodec and CosyVoice2. The results demonstrate that our method successfully generates novel, unseen speakers with quality comparable to that of the training speakers.

We then review a set of successful practices that fuel the rapid development of MIR research. One practice is the annual research benchmark, the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange, where participants compete on a set of research tasks. Another practice is the pursuit of reproducible and open research. The active engagement with industry research and products is another key factor for achieving large societal impacts and motivating younger generations of students to join the field. Last but not the least, the commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion ensures MIR to be a vibrant and open community where various ideas, methodologies, and career pathways collide. We finish by providing future challenges MIR will have to face.

Motivation: 现有的声学全息软件无法提供从抽象到物理化的完整解决方案，缺乏统一的'全栈'工具来支持声学全息应用的开发。

Method: 开发了AcousTools库，支持声学全息应用的完整流程，包括设置、声学传播建模、换能器相位检索、声场分析和硬件控制。

Conclusion: AcousTools将提高研究人员开发新应用和准确评审他人工作的能力，其全栈框架也有助于研究人员理解和比较不同方法。

Abstract: Acoustic Holography is an emerging field where mid-air ultrasound is controlled and manipulated for novel and exciting applications. These range from mid-air haptics, volumetric displays, contactless fabrication, and even chemical and biomedical applications such as drug delivery. To develop these applications, a software framework to predict acoustic behaviour and simulating resulting effects, such as applied forces or scattering patterns is desirable. There have been various software libraries and platforms that attempt to fill this role, but there is yet to be a single piece of software that acts as a 'full-stack' solution. We define this full-stack as the process from abstraction to physicalisation starting with setup, modelling acoustic propagation, transducer phase retrieval, sound field analysis, and control of the acoustic holographic hardware itself. Existing methods fail to fulfil one or more of these categories. To address this, we present AcousTools, a Python-based acoustic holography library, designed to support the full suite of acoustic holographic applications and we show AcousTools's ability to meet each step of the full-stack's requirements. AcousTools has the potential to become the standard code library for acoustic holography, with the uniquely complete suite of features wrapped in a language that is known to be easy to use, AcousTools will increase the ability for researchers to develop novel applications as well as accurately review other's work. The full-stack, aside from software, will also be useful for researchers - providing a way to view and compare methodologies by understanding where they fit into the stack.

While recent large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong reasoning over complex audios, most operate on monaural inputs and lack the ability to capture spatial cues such as direction, elevation, and distance. We introduce SPUR, a lightweight, plug-in approach that equips LALMs with spatial perception through minimal architectural changes. SPUR consists of: (i) a First-Order Ambisonics (FOA) encoder that maps (W, X, Y, Z) channels to rotation-aware, listener-centric spatial features, integrated into target LALMs via a multimodal adapter; and (ii) SPUR-Set, a spatial QA dataset combining open-source FOA recordings with controlled simulations, emphasizing relative direction, elevation, distance, and overlap for supervised spatial reasoning. Fine-tuning our model on the SPUR-Set consistently improves spatial QA and multi-speaker attribution while preserving general audio understanding. SPUR provides a simple recipe that transforms monaural LALMs into spatially aware models. Extensive ablations validate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPUR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d2\u4ef6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u52a8\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6dfb\u52a0\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ecFOA\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6SPUR-Set", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5904\u7406\u5355\u58f0\u9053\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u58f0\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7406\u89e3", "method": "1) FOA\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06(W,X,Y,Z)\u58f0\u9053\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u65cb\u8f6c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u542c\u8005\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) SPUR-Set\u7a7a\u95f4\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u6e90FOA\u5f55\u97f3\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u6a21\u62df\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9002\u914d\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d", "result": "\u5728SPUR-Set\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5f52\u56e0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u97f3\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "SPUR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5355\u58f0\u9053LALMs\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027"}}

A lightweight transfer learning calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to approximately 10%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which exceed 50% error.

Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention.

We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights.

However, this capability also introduces vulnerabilities of arbitrary ``relocation\" if misused by malicious user, such as facilitating advanced voice spoofing attacks or undermining the authenticity of recorded evidence. To address this issue, we propose EchoMark, the first deep learning-based AEM framework that generates perceptually similar RIRs with embedded watermark. Our design tackle the challenges posed by variable RIR characteristics, such as different durations and energy decays, by operating in the latent domain. By jointly optimizing the model with a perceptual loss for RIR reconstruction and a loss for watermark detection, EchoMark achieves both high-quality environment transfer and reliable watermark recovery. Experiments on diverse datasets validate that EchoMark achieves room acoustic parameter matching performance comparable to FiNS, the state-of-the-art RIR estimator. Furthermore, a high Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.22 out of 5, watermark detection accuracy exceeding 99\\%, and bit error rates (BER) below 0.3\\% collectively demonstrate the effectiveness of EchoMark in preserving perceptual quality while ensuring reliable watermark embedding.", "AI": {"tldr": "EchoMark\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u751f\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u8109\u51b2\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u58f0\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u5339\u914d\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u97f3\u6b3a\u9a97\u653b\u51fb\u6216\u7834\u574f\u5f55\u97f3\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9RIR\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6c34\u5370\u68c0\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cEchoMark\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdbRIR\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668FiNS\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u58f0\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\uff0cMOS\u5f97\u52064.22/5\uff0c\u6c34\u5370\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc799%\uff0c\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e0.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "EchoMark\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4e3a\u58f0\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In the first phase, a robust rank-one matrix completion (R1MC) algorithm is used to reconstruct part of the observed channel matrix through low-rank matrix completion (LRMC). To address abrupt rank changes caused by user mobility, a discrete-time autoregressive (AR) model is established that leverages temporal rank correlations across consecutive time instances to enable adaptive observation matrix completion, thereby improving estimation accuracy under dynamic conditions.

To evaluate S5 systems, one can consider two individual metrics, i.e., one for source separation and another for sound event classification, but this approach makes it challenging to compare S5 systems. Thus, a joint class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio (CA-SDR) metric was proposed to evaluate S5 systems. In this work, we first compare the CA-SDR with the classical SDR on scenarios with only classification errors. We then analyze the cases where the metric might not allow proper comparison of the systems.

The conventional localization methods rely on complex infrastructure for providing cooperative anchor nodes that often contribute to higher network overload and energy consumption. To address this, the passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be leveraged as perfectly synced reference nodes for developing anchor-free localization. This work proposes a two-stage framework for localizing user equipment (UE) equipped with multiple antennas. At first, we show that the optimal RIS phase shift matrix maximizing the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for RIS-assisted anchor-free localization is independent of UE location, making the proposed framework scalable without increasing the overhead to control RIS. The proposed two-stage framework first obtains a coarse estimate of UE's location by correlating the received RIS-reflected signal with a dictionary constructed using line-of-sight (LoS) components at a few reference positions. Next, the coarse estimate is refined using Newton's refinement. The numerical results show that the small-sized dictionary, constructed using fewer reference positions, can be employed for accurate localization with a slight increase in the required number of refinement iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e6G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65e0\u951a\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528RIS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540c\u6b65\u53c2\u8003\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316SNR\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u725b\u987f\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f51\u7edc\u8fc7\u8f7d\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u88ab\u52a8RIS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540c\u6b65\u53c2\u8003\u8282\u70b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u951a\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173RIS\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0eLOS\u5206\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5b57\u5178\u83b7\u5f97\u7c97\u7565\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u725b\u987f\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u70bc\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f83\u5c11\u53c2\u8003\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5b57\u5178\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u7565\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\u7ec6\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u589e\u52a0RIS\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65e0\u951a\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u7f51\u7edc\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, malicious exploitation like voice-cloning fraud poses severe security risks. Existing defense techniques struggle to address the production large language model (LLM)-based speech synthesis. While previous studies have considered the protection for fine-tuning synthesizers, they assume manually annotated transcripts. Given the labor intensity of manual annotation, end-to-end (E2E) systems leveraging automatic speech recognition (ASR) to generate transcripts are becoming increasingly prevalent, e.g., voice cloning via commercial APIs. Therefore, this E2E speech synthesis also requires new security mechanisms. To tackle these challenges, we propose E2E-VGuard, a proactive defense framework for two emerging threats: (1) production LLM-based speech synthesis, and (2) the novel attack arising from ASR-driven E2E scenarios. Specifically, we employ the encoder ensemble with a feature extractor to protect timbre, while ASR-targeted adversarial examples disrupt pronunciation. Moreover, we incorporate the psychoacoustic model to ensure perturbative imperceptibility. For a comprehensive evaluation, we test 16 open-source synthesizers and 3 commercial APIs across Chinese and English datasets, confirming E2E-VGuard's effectiveness in timbre and pronunciation protection.

Dimensional groups, or $\u03c0-$groups, allow for the reduction of the number of parameters affecting the dimensionless measured quantities.\n  In many real-world applications, the main interest is in estimating only a subset of the variables affecting the measurements. An example is estimating the thickness and electrical conductivity of a plate from Eddy Current Testing data, regardless of the lift-off of the probe, which may be either uncertain and/or variable. Alternatively, one may seek to estimate thickness and lift-off while neglecting the influence of the electrical conductivity, or to estimate the electrical conductivity and the lift-off, neglecting the thickness.\n  This is where the concept of invariants becomes crucial. An invariant transformation is a mathematical mapping that makes the measured signal independent of one or more of these uncertain parameters. Invariant transformations provide a way to isolate useful signals from uncertain ones, improving the accuracy and reliability of the NdT results.\n  The main contribution of this paper is a systematic method to derive \\emph{invariant} transformations for frequency domain Eddy Current Testing data, via dimensional analysis.

Specifically, by rank analysis, we compare the rank characteristics of Mel-spectrum with other common acoustic degradation factors, and cast the vocoder task as a specialized case of audio restoration, where the range-space spectral (RSS) surrogate of the target spectrum acts as the degraded input. Based on that, we introduce the Schrodinger bridge framework for diffusion modeling, which defines the RSS and target spectrum as dual endpoints of the stochastic generation trajectory. Further, to fully utilize the hierarchical prior of subbands in the time-frequency (T-F) domain, we elaborately devise a novel subband-aware convolutional diffusion network as the data predictor, where subbands are divided following an uneven strategy, and convolutional-style attention module is employed with large kernels for efficient T-F contextual modeling. To enable single-step inference, we propose an omnidirectional distillation loss to facilitate effective information transfer from the teacher model to the student model, and the performance is improved by combining target-related and bijective consistency losses.

The first research community focuses on multimodal sensing of PD-related biomarkers using noninvasive technologies such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), force/pressure insoles, electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), speech and acoustic analysis, and RGB/RGB-D motion capture systems. These studies emphasize data acquisition, feature extraction, and machine learning-based classification for PD screening, diagnosis, and disease progression modeling. In parallel, a second research community has concentrated on robotic intervention and rehabilitation, employing socially assistive robots (SARs), robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) systems, and virtual reality (VR)-integrated robotic platforms for improving motor and cognitive function, enhancing social engagement, and supporting caregivers. Despite the complementary goals of these two domains, their methodological and technological integration remains limited, with minimal data-level or decision-level coupling between the two. With the advent of advanced artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, a unique opportunity now exists to unify these research streams. We envision a closed-loop sensor-AI-robot framework in which multimodal sensing continuously guides the interaction between the patient, caregiver, humanoid robot (and physician) through AI agents that are powered by a multitude of AI models such as robotic and wearables foundation models, LLM-based reasoning, reinforcement learning, and continual learning. Such closed-loop system enables personalized, explainable, and context-aware intervention, forming the basis for digital twin of the PD patient that can adapt over time to deliver intelligent, patient-centered PD care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7AI\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e72\u9884\u5eb7\u590d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ed\u73af\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668-AI-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff1a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e72\u9884\u5eb7\u590d\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u95ed\u73af\u4f20\u611f\u5668-AI-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u6301\u7eed\u6307\u5bfc\u60a3\u8005\u3001\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u3001\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u533b\u751f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AI\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3001LLM\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5f62\u6210\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u4ee5\u60a3\u8005\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u62a4\u7406\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u3002"}}

However, most VC systems require access to target utterances, limiting their use when target data is unavailable or when users desire conversion to entirely novel, unseen voices. To address this, we introduce a lightweight method SpeakerVAE to generate novel speakers for VC. Our approach uses a deep hierarchical variational autoencoder to model the speaker timbre space. By sampling from the trained model, we generate novel speaker representations for voice synthesis in a VC pipeline. The proposed method is a flexible plug-in module compatible with various VC models, without co-training or fine-tuning of the base VC system.

However, their adoption is challenged by the rapid variability of wireless channels, which makes pre-trained static DNN-based receivers ineffective, and by the latency and computational burden of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based learning. In this work, we propose an online learning framework that enables rapid low-complexity adaptation of DNN-based receivers. Our approach is based on two main tenets. First, we cast online learning as Bayesian tracking in parameter space, enabling a single-step adaptation, which deviates from multi-epoch SGD . Second, we focus on modular DNN architectures that enable parallel, online, and localized variational Bayesian updates.

In this paper, we reflect the main research achievements of MIR along the three EDICS related to music analysis, processing and generation. We then review a set of successful practices that fuel the rapid development of MIR research. One practice is the annual research benchmark, the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange, where participants compete on a set of research tasks.

In this work, we study LEO-based positioning under orbital errors within a signal-of-opportunity framework. First, we introduce a LEO orbit model that accounts for Earth's non-sphericity and derive a wideband communication model that captures fast- and slow-time Doppler effects and multipath propagation. Subsequently, we perform a misspecified Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (MCRB) analysis to evaluate the impact of orbital errors on positioning performance. Then, we propose a two-stage positioning method starting with a (i) MCRB-based weighted orbit calibration, followed by (ii) least-squares user positioning using the corrected orbit. The MCRB analysis indicates that orbital errors can induce kilometer-level position biases. Extensive simulations show that the proposed estimator can considerably enhance the positioning accuracy relative to the orbit-mismatched baseline, yielding errors on the order of a few meters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u536b\u661f\u5728\u8f68\u9053\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eMCRB\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u536b\u661f\u867d\u7136\u6709\u671b\u66ff\u4ee3\u5168\u7403\u5bfc\u822a\u536b\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8f68\u9053\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u5730\u7403\u975e\u7403\u9762\u6027\u7684LEO\u8f68\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bbd\u9891\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884cMCRB\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f68\u9053\u8bef\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eMCRB\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u8f68\u9053\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "MCRB\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8f68\u9053\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u516c\u91cc\u7ea7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\u8f68\u9053\u5931\u914d\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u8fbe\u7c73\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8f68\u9053\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u536b\u661f\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A detailed PSI-enabled reconstruction model is formulated using various forms of PSI. The hierarchical block orthogonal matching pursuit with PSI (HiBOMP-P) algorithm is designed in a recursive form to reliably recover hierarchically block-sparse signals. We derive exact recovery conditions (ERCs) measured by the mutual incoherence property (MIP), wherein hierarchical MIP concepts are proposed, and further develop reconstructible sparsity levels to reveal sufficient conditions for ERCs.

These range from mid-air haptics, volumetric displays, contactless fabrication, and even chemical and biomedical applications such as drug delivery. To develop these applications, a software framework to predict acoustic behaviour and simulating resulting effects, such as applied forces or scattering patterns is desirable. There have been various software libraries and platforms that attempt to fill this role, but there is yet to be a single piece of software that acts as a 'full-stack' solution. We define this full-stack as the process from abstraction to physicalisation starting with setup, modelling acoustic propagation, transducer phase retrieval, sound field analysis, and control of the acoustic holographic hardware itself. Existing methods fail to fulfil one or more of these categories. To address this, we present AcousTools, a Python-based acoustic holography library, designed to support the full suite of acoustic holographic applications and we show AcousTools's ability to meet each step of the full-stack's requirements. AcousTools has the potential to become the standard code library for acoustic holography, with the uniquely complete suite of features wrapped in a language that is known to be easy to use, AcousTools will increase the ability for researchers to develop novel applications as well as accurately review other's work.

However, GFlowNet-based approaches assume static environments, limiting their applicability in mobile wireless networks. In this paper, we proposes a novel Meta-GFlowNet framework that achieves rapid adaptation to dynamic conditions using model-agnostic meta-learning. As the communication user is moving, the framework learns a direction-general prior across user directions via inner trajectory-balance updates and outer meta-updates, enabling quick convergence to new user directions. The approach requires no labeled data, employing a pseudo-supervised consistency objective derived from the learned reward by GFlowNet and the actual sum-rate reward of the TM-IRS system. Simulation results show that the proposed method attains faster adaptation and higher secrecy performance than retrained GFlowNets, offering an efficient GenAI framework for dynamic wireless environments.

Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Omni-AVSR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u542c\u89c9\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b(ASR)\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b(VSR)\u548c\u89c6\u542c\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b(AVSR)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u56fa\u5b9a\u901f\u7387token\u538b\u7f29\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528matryoshka\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u9002\u914d\u9aa8\u5e72LLM\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728LRS2\u548cLRS3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOmni-AVSR\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u8d44\u6e90\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Omni-AVSR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301ASR\u3001VSR\u548cAVSR\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

We efficiently train a family of k-space-position-specific Mobile-GRAPPA kernels via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) and apply them across k-space to generate clean data. In experiments on highly motion-corrupted 1-mm whole-brain GRE (Tacq = 10 min; 1,620 motion/dB0 trackings) and EPTI (Tacq = 2 min; 544 trackings), Mobile-GRAPPA enabled accurate reconstruction with negligible time penalty, whereas full Aligned-SENSE was impractical (reconstruction times > 10 h for GRE and > 10 days for EPTI).

A channel switching mechanism is deployed to reroute communication through alternative non-line-of-sight paths when the primary line-of-sight links are obstructed. Moreover, a dynamic power allocation strategy enforces a minimum rate constraint for the weak NOMA user, ensuring consistent quality of service. Extensive simulations over multiple blockage scenarios and signal to noise (SNR) conditions validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Notably, under severe blockage, the system achieves up to a 400% sensing rate enhancement at 15 dB SNR, with only a 20% reduction in communication rate.

In an attempt to address the global digital divide problem, this paper explores a multi-high-altitude platform system (HAPS)-ground integrated network, in which multiple HAPSs collaborate with ground base stations (BSs) to enhance the users' quality of service on the ground to achieve the highly sought-after digital equity. To this end, this paper considers maximizing both the network-wide weighted sum rate function and the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) function subject to the same system level constraints. More specifically, the paper tackles the two different optimization problems so as to balance throughput and fairness, by accounting for the individual HAPS payload connectivity constraints, HAPS and BS distinct power limitations, and per-user rate requirements. This paper solves the considered problems using techniques from optimization theory by adopting a generalized assignment problem (GAP)-based methodology to determine the user association variables, jointly with successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithms for optimizing the corresponding beamforming vectors. One of the main advantages of the proposed algorithms is their amenability for distributed implementation across the multiple HAPSs and BSs.

These activities, such as air taxis, rely on low-altitude wireless networks, and one key enabling technology is integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, in low-altitude airspace, ISAC is vulnerable to channel-access attacks, thereby degrading performance and threatening safety. To address this, we propose a defense framework based on a Stackelberg game. Specifically, we first model the system under attack, deriving metrics for the communication and the sensing to quantify performance. Then, we formulate the interaction as a three-player game where a malicious attacker acts as the leader, while the legitimate drone and ground base station act as followers. Using a backward induction algorithm, we obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium, allowing the defenders to dynamically adjust their strategies to mitigate the attack.

In particular, the conventional MGM beamforming requires substantial computational complexity and feedback (or pilot) overhead for acquisition of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), while simultaneous interference management and multicast beamforming optimization across multi-group inevitably incurs a significant rate loss. To address this, we propose a CSIT-free MGM (CF-MGM) transmission that eliminates the need for a complex CSIT acquisition. A deterministic CSIT-free precoding and proposed closed-form power allocation based on max-min fairness (MMF) allow each user to detect the common multicast stream completely canceling the inter-group interference with a significantly low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority and scalability of the proposed CF-MGM for the achievable rate and increase of users in a group outperforming the existing CSIT-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u514dCSIT\u7684\u591a\u7ec4\u591a\u64ad\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u6d88\u9664\u7ec4\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u5f00\u9500", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u7ec4\u591a\u64ad\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548cCSIT\u83b7\u53d6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ba1\u7406\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u64ad\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901f\u7387\u635f\u5931", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027CSIT-free\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u8ba9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u7ec4\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u68c0\u6d4b\u516c\u5171\u591a\u64ad\u6d41", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0CF-MGM\u5728\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u7387\u548c\u7ec4\u5185\u7528\u6237\u589e\u52a0\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709CSIT-based\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027", "conclusion": "CF-MGM\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u591a\u7ec4\u591a\u64ad\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742CSIT\u83b7\u53d6\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4f20\u8f93"}}

This paper derives the closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint velocity estimation using a modular linear array (MLA) within a predictive-beamforming framework. The analysis shows that increasing inter-module separation enlarges the effective aperture and reduces the transverse-velocity CRB, whereas the radial-velocity CRB is largely insensitive to separation. We further obtain a simple closed-form relation linking the achievable antenna savings to the inter-module separation while preserving the same transverse accuracy of a uniform linear array (ULA).

We derive a closed-form lower bound on the warden's average minimum detection error probability which is then used to define the covert constraint. Building on this, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the UAV's 3D placement, its power allocation, and the satellite's transmit power to maximize the system's covert rate.

Unlike previous studies that mainly rely on idealized isotropic antenna models, we adopt a polarimetric model that takes advantage of effective aperture distribution functions to characterize realistic antenna patterns, placements, and polarization effects. Based on this model, we analyze the fundamental limits of UE positioning using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB). The FIM is shown to be expressed as a weighted sum of the information contributions from individual access point (AP)-UE pairs, with each contribution interpreted geometrically across distance, azimuth, and elevation dimensions. The impact of the UE tilt and the spatial distribution of APs on the PEBs is further analyzed. As a further advancement, we propose a complete positioning framework from a UE tracking perspective. By integrating a global probability hypothesis density filter and a PEB-aware AP management strategy, the framework enables accurate tracking while optimizing AP scheduling. Finally, we present a distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate a centimeter-level tracking accuracy. In addition, the PEB-aware AP management strategy is shown to maintain robust tracking performance while significantly reducing the number of concurrently active APs, thus lowering the overall system overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7528\u62373D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6781\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u5047\u8bbe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548cPEB\u611f\u77e5AP\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5929\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u5929\u7ebf\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u6781\u5316\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6781\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u76843D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6781\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5b54\u5f84\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u6982\u7387\u5047\u8bbe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548cPEB\u611f\u77e5AP\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u4fe1\u9053\u6d4b\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0cPEB\u611f\u77e5AP\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u6d3b\u8dc3AP\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u4f53\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6781\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u76843D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}

The difficulty of the problem is further amplified in structural systems subjected to natural hazards such as earthquakes or windstorms, where responses are often highly transient, nonlinear, and spatially distributed. To address this challenge, we introduce Spectrum and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SaPINNs) for efficient input--state--parameter estimation in systems under complex excitations characteristic of natural hazards. The proposed model enhances the neural network with governing physics of the system dynamics and incorporates spectral information of natural hazards by using empirically derived spectra as priors on the unknown excitations. This integration improves inference of unmeasured inputs, system states, and parameters without imposing restrictive assumptions on their dynamics. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated through comparative studies on both linear and nonlinear systems under various types of excitation, including the El Centro earthquake, where the seismic spectrum is assumed to be not precisely known. To account for predictive uncertainty, the proposed architecture is embedded within a Deep Ensemble (DEns) networks architecture, providing distributions over possible solutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional PINNs, as the incorporation of spectral information introduces an inductive bias that guides the network more effectively through the solution space and enhances its ability to recover physically consistent state and parameter estimates with realistic uncertainty levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSaPINNs\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f93\u5165-\u72b6\u6001-\u53c2\u6570\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfPINNs\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u662f\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u77ac\u6001\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9891\u8c31\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPINNs\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6062\u590d\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "SaPINNs\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Unlike the far-field scenario, near-field wavefronts exhibit strong dependencies on both angle and distance due to spherical wave propagation, leading to complicated variations in received signal strength (RSS). To effectively capture the intricate spatial variations structure inherent in near-field environments, a regularized RBF interpolation method is developed to enhance radio map reconstruction accuracy. Leveraging theoretical insights from interpolation error analysis of RBF, an inverse \u03bc-law-inspired nonuniform sampling strategy is introduced to allocate measurements adaptively, emphasizing regions with rapid RSS variations near the transmitter. To further exploit the global low-rank structure in the near-field radio map, we integrate RBF interpolation with nuclear norm minimization (NNM)-based matrix completion. A robust Huberized leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme is then proposed for adaptive selection of the tolerance parameter, facilitating optimal fusion between RBF interpolation and matrix completion. The integration of local variation structure modeling via RBF interpolation and global low-rank structure exploitation via matrix completion yields a structure-aware framework that substantially improves the accuracy of near-field radio map reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 10% improvement in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to standard interpolation and matrix completion methods under varying sampling densities and shadowing conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f84\u5411\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eXL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728NMSE\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc710%\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u573a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7531\u4e8e\u7403\u9762\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u968f\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5448\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6b63\u5219\u5316RBF\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u03bc\u5f8b\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210RBF\u63d2\u503c\u4e0e\u6838\u8303\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684Huberized LOOCV\u65b9\u6848\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u5bb9\u5dee\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u91c7\u6837\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc710%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7RBF\u63d2\u503c\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd1\u573a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

To provide connectivity to a massive number of these nodes, backscatter communication (BC) is emerging as an energy- and cost-efficient technology exploiting the reflection of radio frequency signals. However, challenges such as round-trip path loss and direct link interference (DLI) between the carrier emitter and the reader limit its performance. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a joint access point role selection and a novel beamforming technique for bistatic BC in a distributed multiple-input multiple- output setup. The proposed approach boosts the received backscattered energy while effectively mitigating DLI, thereby reducing the error probability. We also propose a channel estimation method tailored to operate under DLI conditions and propose a mismatch detector using estimated channel coefficients. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability of error for the detectors and model the quantization noise caused by DLI. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed method with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) effectively mitigates DLI, reduces the quantization noise, and enhances backscattered signal energy, achieving performance comparable to the benchmark scenario with 8-bit ADCs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u53cc\u57fa\u5730\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u89d2\u8272\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u91cf\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u76f4\u63a5\u94fe\u8def\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u57281\u4f4dADC\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e8\u4f4dADC\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u6765\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u4e2d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u9762\u4e34\u5f80\u8fd4\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u94fe\u8def\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u89d2\u8272\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5728DLI\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fe1\u9053\u7cfb\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5931\u914d\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bef\u7801\u6982\u7387\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u75281\u4f4dADC\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236DLI\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e8\u4f4dADC\u57fa\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Cooperation among AVs is successful when the environment is unknown, or changes dynamically, so as to improve coverage and trip time, and minimize the traveled distance. The AVs, while mapping the environment with range-based sensors, move across the wireless coverage areas, with consequences on the achieved access bit rate, latency, and handover rate. In this paper, we propose to modify the cost of path planning algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*, so that not only the traveled distance is considered in the best path solution, but also the radio coverage experience. To this aim, several radio-related cost-weighting functions are introduced and tested, to assess the performance of the proposed techniques with extensive simulations. The proposed mapping algorithm can achieve a mapping error probability below 2%, while the proposed path-planning algorithms extend the experienced radio coverage of the AVs, with limited distance increase with respect to shortest-path existing methods, such as conventional Dijkstra and A* algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65e0\u7ebf\u8986\u76d6\u4f53\u9a8c\u7eb3\u5165\u8def\u5f84\u6210\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u6620\u5c04\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u8fde\u63a5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u7ebf\u8fde\u63a5\u6765\u5378\u8f7d\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u8f66\u8f86\u79fb\u52a8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a5\u5165\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5207\u6362\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ea\u8003\u8651\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u65e0\u7ebf\u8986\u76d6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4fee\u6539Dijkstra\u548cA*\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6210\u672c\u52a0\u6743\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8fd8\u8003\u8651\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u8986\u76d6\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u4e8e2%\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86AVs\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u8986\u76d6\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65e0\u7ebf\u8986\u76d6\u8d28\u91cf\u7eb3\u5165\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

By treating the phase-shifter (PS) and true-time-delay (TTD) parameters as learnable weights, the system adaptively refines its sensing beam to exploit environment-specific multipath characteristics. A structured multi-stage training strategy is proposed to ensure stable convergence and effective end-to-end optimization.

In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of unknown emitter detection systems across key aspects of the design space, focusing on data modality, learning approaches, and feature learn- ing modules.

Furthermore, we introduce interpretable Kolmogorov--Arnold Net- works (KANs) to enhance model transparency, and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based initialization procedure for feature learning modules operating on sparse 2D-Constellation data, which improves the performance of Deep Clustering approaches by up to 40\\% across the same metrics comparing to the modules without SVD initialization.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide valuable tools for logistics collection within LAE systems, offering the ability to navigate through complex environments, avoid obstacles, and improve operational efficiency. However, logistics collection tasks involve UAVs flying through complex three-dimensional (3D) environments while avoiding obstacles, where traditional UAV trajectory design methods,typically developed under free-space conditions without explicitly accounting for obstacles, are not applicable. This paper presents, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) methods to minimize the total collection time. Specifically, the LKH algorithm determines the optimal order of item collection, while the DDPG algorithm designs the flight trajectory between collection points. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed LKH-DDPG algorithm significantly reduces collection time by approximately 49 percent compared to baseline approaches, thereby highlighting its effectiveness in optimizing UAV trajectories and enhancing operational efficiency for logistics collection tasks in the LAE paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408LKH\u548cDDPG\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7269\u6d41\u6536\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea649%\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u65f6\u95f4", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7269\u6d41\u6536\u96c6\u9700\u8981\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e09\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u907f\u969c\u98de\u884c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408LKH\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u7269\u54c1\u6536\u96c6\u987a\u5e8f\uff0cDDPG\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6536\u96c6\u70b9\u95f4\u98de\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793aLKH-DDPG\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea649%\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u65f6\u95f4", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u7269\u6d41\u6536\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387"}}

By exploiting the beamforming capabilities of massive MIMO, multicasting provides a spectrum-efficient solution that avoids unnecessary intra-group interference. A key challenge, however, is solving the max-min fair (MMF) and quality-of-service (QoS) multicast beamforming optimization problems, which are NP-hard due to the non-convex structure and the requirement for rank-1 solutions. Traditional approaches based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) followed by randomization exhibit poor scalability with system size, while state-of-the-art successive convex approximation (SCA) methods only guarantee convergence to stationary points. In this paper, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based framework for MMF and QoS multicast beamforming in cell-free massive MIMO networks. The algorithm leverages SDR but incorporates a novel iterative elimination strategy within the ADMM updates to efficiently obtain near-global optimal rank-1 beamforming solutions with reduced computational complexity compared to standard SDP solvers and randomization methods. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ADMM-based procedure not only achieves superior spectral efficiency but also scales favorably with the number of antennas and UEs compared to state-of-the-art SCA-based algorithms, making it a practical tool for next-generation multicast systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eADMM\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u670d\u52a1\u591a\u64ad\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d88\u9664\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u5f97\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u79e91\u89e3\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u591a\u64ad\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5411\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4f20\u8f93\u5171\u540c\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u670d\u52a1\u591a\u64ad\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u662fNP-hard\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u677e\u5f1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9a7b\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u65b9\u5411\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u677e\u5f1b\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d88\u9664\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728ADMM\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u5f97\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u79e91\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0ADMM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5ADMM\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u591a\u64ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u83b7\u5f97\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While essentially all soft-decision decoders assume that bits have been impacted independently on the channel, for one of these new approaches it has been established that channel dependencies can be exploited to achieve superior decoding accuracy, resulting in Ordered Reliability Bits Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding Approximate Independence (ORBGRAND-AI). Building on that capability, here we consider the integration of ORBGRAND-AI as a pattern generator for Guessing Codeword Decoding (GCD). We first establish that a direct approach delivers mildly degraded block error rate (BLER) but with reduced number of queried patterns when compared to ORBGRAND-AI. We then show that with a more nuanced approach it is possible to leverage total correlation to deliver an additional BLER improvement of around 0.75 dB while retaining reduced query numbers.", "AI": {"tldr": "ORBGRAND-AI\u88ab\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u731c\u6d4b\u7801\u5b57\u89e3\u7801(GCD)\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5757\u9519\u8bef\u7387(BLER)\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8f6f\u5224\u51b3\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u662f\u72ec\u7acb\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\uff0c\u4f46ORBGRAND-AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06ORBGRAND-AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u5230GCD\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u91c7\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06ORBGRAND-AI\u96c6\u6210\u5230GCD\u4e2d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u603b\u76f8\u5173\u6027(total correlation)\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4ORBGRAND-AI\u5728BLER\u4e0a\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\uff1b\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u989d\u5916\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ea60.75 dB\u7684BLER\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06ORBGRAND-AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u5230GCD\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While multimodal approaches combining audio and video have demonstrated effectiveness, their reliance on high-performance graphical computing limits deployment on resource-constrained devices such as personal computers or home audiovisual systems. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel audio-only ensemble learning framework capable of classifying movie scenes into three emotional categories: Good, Neutral, and Bad. The model integrates ten support vector machines and six neural networks within a stacking ensemble architecture to enhance classification performance. A tailored data preprocessing pipeline, including feature extraction, outlier handling, and feature engineering, is designed to optimize emotional information from audio inputs. Experiments on a simulated dataset achieve 67% accuracy, while a real-world dataset collected from 15 diverse films yields an impressive 86% accuracy. These results underscore the potential of audio-based, lightweight emotion recognition methods for broader consumer-level applications, offering both computational efficiency and robust classification capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u5f71\u573a\u666f\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u96c6\u621010\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u548c6\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5806\u53e0\u96c6\u6210\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u738767%\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe86%", "conclusion": "\u97f3\u9891\u57fa\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u90e8\u7f72"}}

Leveraging generative modeling, StableUASim produces diverse and statistically realistic channel realizations, while supporting conditional generation from specific measurement samples. Pre-training enables rapid adaptation to new environments using minimal additional data, and the autoencoder latent representation facilitates efficient channel analysis and compression.

However, existing INR frameworks -- including MLPs with Fourier features, SIREN, and multiresolution hash grids -- implicitly assume a \\textit{global and stationary} spectral basis. This assumption is fundamentally misaligned with real-world signals whose frequency characteristics vary significantly across space, exhibiting local high-frequency textures, smooth regions, and frequency drift phenomena. We propose \\textbf{Neural Spectral Transport Representation (NSTR)}, the first INR framework that \\textbf{explicitly models a spatially varying local frequency field}. NSTR introduces a learnable \\emph{frequency transport equation}, a PDE that governs how local spectral compositions evolve across space. Given a learnable local spectrum field $S(x)$ and a frequency transport network $F_\u03b8$ enforcing $\\nabla S(x) \\approx F_\u03b8(x, S(x))$, NSTR reconstructs signals by spatially modulating a compact set of global sinusoidal bases. This formulation enables strong local adaptivity and offers a new level of interpretability via visualizing frequency flows. Experiments on 2D image regression, audio reconstruction, and implicit 3D geometry show that NSTR achieves significantly better accuracy-parameter trade-offs than SIREN, Fourier-feature MLPs, and Instant-NGP. NSTR requires fewer global frequencies, converges faster, and naturally explains signal structure through spectral transport fields.

However, evaluation methods lag behind: typical mean opinion score (MOS) estimators perform regression over entire utterances, while failures usually occur in a few problematic words. We observe that encoder-decoder ASR models (e.g., Whisper) surface word-level mismatches between speech and text via cross-attention, providing a fine-grained reward signal. Building on this, we introduce Word-level TTS Alignment by ASR-driven Attentive Reward (W3AR). Without explicit reward annotations, W3AR uses attention from a pre-trained ASR model to drive finer-grained alignment and optimization of sequences predicted by a TTS model.

Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced.

TTS systems usually depend on reference audio for timbre, offer only limited text-level attribute control, and rarely support dialogue generation. TTM systems are constrained by input conditioning requirements that depend on expert knowledge annotations. The high heterogeneity of these input control conditions makes them difficult to joint modeling with speech synthesis. Despite sharing common acoustic modeling characteristics, these two tasks have long been developed independently, leaving open the challenge of achieving unified modeling through natural language instructions. We introduce InstructAudio, a unified framework that enables instruction-based (natural language descriptions) control of acoustic attributes including timbre (gender, age), paralinguistic (emotion, style, accent), and musical (genre, instrument, rhythm, atmosphere). It supports expressive speech, music, and dialogue generation in English and Chinese. The model employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers with a standardized instruction-phoneme input format, trained on 50K hours of speech and 20K hours of music data, enabling multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment. Fig. 1 visualizes performance comparisons with mainstream TTS and TTM models, demonstrating that InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics.

To address these challenges, the propagation environment semantics-aware wireless environment knowledge beam prediction (PES-WEKBP) framework is proposed. PES-WEKBP pioneers a novel electromagnetic (EM)-grounded knowledge distillation method, transforming raw visual data into an ultra-lean, interpretable material and location-related wireless environment knowledge matrix. This matrix explicitly encodes critical propagation environment semantics, which is material EM properties and spatial relationships through a physics-informed parameterization process, distilling the environment and channel interplay into a minimal yet information-dense representation. A lightweight decision network then leverages this highly compressed knowledge for low-complexity beam prediction. To holistically evaluate the performance of PES-WEKBP, we first design the prediction consistency-efficiency index (PCEI), which combines prediction accuracy with a stability-penalized logarithmic training time to ensure a balanced optimization of reliability and computational efficiency. Experiments validate that PES-WEKBP achieves a 99.75% to 99.96% dimension reduction and improves accuracy by 5.52% to 8.19%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PCEI scores across diverse vehicular scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PES-WEKBP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u78c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8d85\u7cbe\u7b80\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u77e5\u8bc6\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8f93\u5165\u964d\u7ef4\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u78c1\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u6750\u6599\u7535\u78c1\u7279\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u77e5\u8bc6\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u51b3\u7b56\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8699.75%\u81f399.96%\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7f29\u51cf\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53475.52%\u81f38.19%\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027-\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6570\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PES-WEKBP\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.

Signal Process", "summary": "Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is well-suited for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), yet its cyclic prefix (CP) is dimensioned for communications-grade multipath and is generally insufficient for sensing. When echoes exceed the CP duration, inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISI/ICI) break subcarrier orthogonality and degrade sensing. This paper presents a unified analytical and algorithmic framework for OFDM-ISAC beyond the CP limit. We first develop a general echo model that explicitly captures the structured coupling of ISI and ICI caused by CP insufficiency. Building on this model, we derive closed-form expressions for the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the range-Doppler peak sidelobe level ratio (PSLR), both of which are shown to deteriorate approximately linearly with the normalized excess delay beyond the CP. To mitigate these effects, we propose two standard-compatible successive interference cancellation (SIC) methods: SIC-DFT, a low-complexity DFT-based scheme, and SIC-ESPRIT, a super-resolution subspace approach. Simulations corroborate the analysis and demonstrate consistent gains over representative benchmarks. Both algorithms provide more than $4$dB SINR improvement under CP-insufficient conditions, while SIC-ESPRIT reduces range/velocity root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) by about one order of magnitude, approaching the performance achievable with a sufficiently long CP. These results offer both theoretical insight and practical solutions for reliable long-range OFDM-ISAC sensing beyond the CP limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684OFDM-ISAC\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5faa\u73af\u524d\u7f00\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u51c6\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "OFDM\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u524d\u7f00\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea7\u591a\u5f84\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u611f\u77e5\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5f53\u56de\u6ce2\u8d85\u8fc7CP\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u65f6\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u95f4\u548c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u56de\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6355\u83b7CP\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684ISI/ICI\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8026\u5408\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u51c6\u517c\u5bb9\u7684SIC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684SIC-DFT\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5SIC-ESPRIT\u3002", "result": "\u5728CP\u4e0d\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d85\u8fc74dB\u7684SINR\u6539\u8fdb\uff0cSIC-ESPRIT\u5c06\u8ddd\u79bb/\u901f\u5ea6RMSE\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u8db3\u591f\u957fCP\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8d85\u8d8aCP\u9650\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u957f\u8ddd\u79bbOFDM-ISAC\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes.

A repeater is an active scatterer that retransmits incoming signals with a complex gain almost instantaneously, thereby enhancing sensing performance by amplifying the echoes reflected by the targets. The same mechanism can also improve downlink communication by mitigating coverage holes. However, the repeater introduces noise and increases interference at the sensing receiver, while also amplifying the interference from target detection signals at the downlink users. The proposed framework accounts for these sensing-communication trade-offs and demonstrates the potential benefits achievable through a carefully designed precoder at the transmitting base station.

We propose a novel approach that integrates a computational tonal tension model, based on tonal interval vector analysis, into a Transformer framework. Our method employs a two-level beam search strategy during inference. At the token level, generated candidates are re-ranked using model probability and diversity metrics to maintain overall quality. At the bar level, a tension-based re-ranking is applied to ensure that the generated music aligns with a desired tension curve.

Our key idea lies in spreading data symbols across the delay-Doppler (DD) domain through orthogonal chirp-Zak transform (CZT). To enable efficient signal multiplexing, the proposed modulation scheme employs a transmitter signal that maintains orthogonality with the inherent resolution characteristics of the DD plane. Termed as Orthogonal Chirp Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (CDDM), we demonstrate a synergistic integration of chirp waveform properties with the channel structure of the DD domain, thereby achieving advantages with both lower computational efficiency and improved detection performance. We introduce a novel CZT-based superimposed sparse pilot structure to enable simultaneous estimation of delay-Doppler shifts and channel coefficients. For enhanced performance, we further develop an embedded pilot scheme that demonstrates channel estimation performance comparable to that of Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ODDM) systems. Simulation results demonstrate that CDDM achieves significant bit error rate (BER) improvements over existing modulation schemes , under perfect channel state information (CSI), as well as superior out-of-band emissions (OOBE). Further, for the imperfect CSI case, the proposed CZT-based superimposed pilot scheme leads to significantly reduced normalized mean square error (NMSE), whilst attaining equivalent estimation accuracy to that of ODDM with lower computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u5541\u557e-Zak\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u591a\u8f7d\u6ce2\u8c03\u5236\u6846\u67b6CDDM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u57df\u4fe1\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u5541\u557e-Zak\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCZT\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u7a00\u758f\u5bfc\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5bfc\u9891\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b8c\u7f8eCSI\u4e0b\uff0cCDDM\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5e26\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8eCSI\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bfc\u9891\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0eODDM\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "CDDM\u8c03\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u5541\u557e\u6ce2\u5f62\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u57df\u4fe1\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

The effectiveness of the developed three-stage strategy stems from the careful design of both the pilot signal sequence of the users and the vectors of RIS. Specifically, in Stage I, the cascaded channel components are eliminated by configuring the RIS phase shift vectors with a \u03c0 difference to estimate the direct channels for all users. The orthogonal subspace projection is employed in Stage II to obtain equivalent signal matrices, enabling the estimation of angles of departure (AoDs) of the user-RIS channel for all users. In Stage III, we combine the signals of the time slots with the same pilots and project obtained measurement matrix to the orthogonal complement space of the component consisting of the portion of the direct channel, which removes the direct components and thus prevents error propagation from the direct channels to the cascaded channels. Then, we estimate the angles of arrival (AoAs) of the RIS-BS channel and remaining parameters of the cascaded channel for all users by exploiting the sparsity and correlation in the obtained equivalent matrices.

This enables continuous optimization over both angles while maintaining performance across a wide frequency range. We evaluate our method through simulations of beamwidth, white noise gain, and directivity across multiple frequencies. A comparative analysis is presented against standard and advanced beamformers, including delay-and-sum, modified delay-and-sum, a Jacobi-Anger expansion-based method, and a Gaussian window-based gradient descent approach. Our method achieves superior spatial selectivity and narrower mainlobes, particularly in the elevation axis at lower frequencies. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing beamforming performance for acoustic sensing and spatial audio applications requiring precise dual-axis control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u5de5\u5177autograd\u4e0e\u540c\u5fc3\u5706\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u9635\u5217\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6ce2\u675f\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u53cc\u8f74\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u4ef0\u89d2\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e73\u9762\u548c\u540c\u5fc3\u5706\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u9635\u5217\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u548c\u4ef0\u89d2\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u97f3\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u4ef0\u89d2\u63a7\u5236\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u9635\u5217\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528autograd\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u540c\u5fc3\u5706\u9635\u5217\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u6ce2\u675f\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u53cc\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6ce2\u675f\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3001\u767d\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u4e3b\u74e3\u5bbd\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u4ef0\u89d2\u8f74\u4e0a\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u58f0\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u97f3\u9891\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u53cc\u8f74\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The proposed algorithm employs truncated statistics to separate target and noise components in the radar echo power spectrum, thereby restoring the homogeneity assumption of the reference window. In addition, learnable historical sidelobe information is introduced to enhance the robustness and environmental adaptability of the detection process. Furthermore, based on multichannel echo data, a target reconstruction model that combines the Candan algorithm with least-squares estimation is established, incorporating the CLEAN concept to suppress sidelobe interference. Monte Carlo simulations and real-world measurement experiments demonstrate that the proposed CT-CFAR algorithm achieves high-precision target detection without requiring prior knowledge of abnormal samples.

Nevertheless, existing studies are largely confined to single-antenna systems, failing to offer dedicated guidance for multi-antenna communication scenarios. To address the inherent conflict between traditional real-value pathloss map and multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) coherent beamforming in B5G/6G systems, this paper proposes a novel concept of BeamCKM and CKMTransUNet architecture. The CKMTransUNet approach combines a UNet backbone for multi-scale feature extraction with a vision transformer (ViT) module to capture global dependencies among encoded linear vectors, utilizing a composite loss function to characterize the beam propagation characteristics. Furthermore, based on the CKMTransUNet backbone, this paper presents a methodology named M3ChanNet. It leverages the multi-modal learning technique and cross-attention mechanisms to extract intrinsic side information from environmental profiles and real-time multi-beam observations, thereby further improving the map construction accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) interpolation methods and deep learning (DL) approaches, delivering superior performance even when environmental contours are inaccurate.

Conventional wireless networks operate based on the static rules with predefined algorithms, lacking the self-adaptation ability. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) provides a possibility for wireless networks to become more intelligent and fully automated. As such, we plan to integrate the cognitive capability and high intelligence of the emerging AI agents into wireless networks. In this work, we propose AutoMAS, a generic multi-agent system which can autonomously select the most suitable wireless optimization algorithm according to the dynamic wireless environment. Our AutoMAS combines theoretically guaranteed wireless algorithms with agents' perception ability, thereby providing sounder solutions to complex tasks no matter how the environment changes. As an example, we conduct a case study on the classical channel estimation problem, where the mobile user moves in diverse environments with different channel propagation characteristics. Simulation results demonstrate that our AutoMAS can guarantee the highest accuracy in changing scenarios.

Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves a similar beam prediction accuracy to the baseline with an 83% complexity reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8f85\u52a9\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u7f51\u7edc\u51cf\u5c1183%\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u5c42\u6b20\u5b8c\u5907\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u964d\u7ef4\u80fd\u529b\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8683%", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8f85\u52a9\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e6G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f"}}

A key challenge here is obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI), especially with extremely large IRS (XL-IRS), due to near-field propagation, high-dimensional wideband cascaded channels, and the passive nature of the XL-IRS. In addition, most existing CSI acquisition methods fail to leverage the spatio-temporal sparsity inherent in the channel, resulting in suboptimal estimation performance. To address these challenges, we consider an XL-IRS-aided wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system and propose an efficient channel estimation and tracking (CET) algorithm. Specifically, a unified near-field cascaded channel representation model is presented first, and a hierarchical spatio-temporal sparse prior is then constructed to capture two-dimensional (2D) block sparsity in the polar domain, one-dimensional (1D) clustered sparsity in the angle-delay domain, and temporal correlations across different channel estimation frames. Based on these priors, a tensor-based sparse CET (TS-CET) algorithm is proposed that integrates tensor-based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) with particle-based variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and message passing.

Unlike learning-based JSCC methods that implicitly absorb channel variations, Robust-NTC explicitly models element-wise latent distributions via a variational objective with a Gaussian proxy for quantization and channel noise, allowing encoder-decoder to capture latent uncertainty without channel-specific training. Using the learned statistics, Robust-NTC also facilitates rate-distortion optimization to adaptively select element-wise quantizers and bit depths according to online channel condition. To support practical deployment, Robust-NTC is integrated into an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where a unified resource allocation framework jointly optimizes latent quantization, bit allocation, modulation order, and power allocation to minimize transmission latency while guaranteeing learned distortion targets. Simulation results demonstrate that for practical OFDM systems, Robust-NTC achieves superior rate-distortion efficiency and stable reconstruction fidelity compared to digital JSCC baselines across wide-ranging SNR conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRobust-NTC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u6f5c\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4fe1\u9053\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f20\u8f93\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u91cf\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4fe1\u9053\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6570\u5b57\u8054\u5408\u4fe1\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684JSCC\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u5f0f\u5438\u6536\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u4ee3\u7406\u5904\u7406\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u5230OFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8c03\u5236\u9636\u6570\u548c\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728OFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cRobust-NTC\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdbSNR\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6570\u5b57JSCC\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "Robust-NTC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b57JSCC\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel wireless sensing system based on MA arrays to enhance multi-target spatial angle estimation performance. We begin by characterizing the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for multi-target angle of arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the antenna's positions in MA arrays, thereby establishing a theoretical foundation for antenna position optimization. Then, aiming at improving the sensing coverage performance, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the expectation of the trace of the CRB matrix over random target angles subject to a given distribution by optimizing the antennas' positions. To tackle the formulated challenging optimization problem, the Monte Carlo method is employed to approximate the intractable objective function, and a swarm-based gradient descent algorithm is subsequently proposed to address the approximated problem. In addition, a lower-bound on the sum of CRBs for multi-target AoA estimation is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-based design achieves superior sensing performance compared to conventional systems using fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays and single-target-oriented MA arrays, in terms of decreasing both CRB and the actual AoA estimation mean square error (MSE). Fundamentally, the designed MA array geometry exhibits low correlation and high effective power of sensitivity vectors for multi-target sensing in the angular domain, leading to significant CRB performance improvement. The resultant low correlation of steering vectors over multiple targets' directions further helps mitigate angle estimation ambiguity and thus enhances MSE performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u548c\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4eCRB\u548c\u5b9e\u9645AoA\u4f30\u8ba1\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u79fb\u52a8\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b2c\u516d\u4ee3\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u76ee\u6807AoA\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684CRB\u77e9\u9635\u4e0e\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316CRB\u77e9\u9635\u8ff9\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u903c\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u964d\u4f4eCRB\u548c\u5b9e\u9645AoA\u4f30\u8ba1\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u548c\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u89d2\u5ea6\u57df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5411\u91cf\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86CRB\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5bfc\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u8f7b\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347MSE\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, path loss, and atmospheric loss induce random attenuation, challenging link reliability. Adaptive rate control technology enhances spectrum utilization and reliability. We propose an adaptive probabilistic constellation shaping (A-PCS) coherent system utilizing enumerated spherical shaping (ESS) for distribution matching. With PCS-64QAM, the system achieves continuous rate control from conventional QPSK-equivalent to 64QAM spectral efficiency, providing quasi-continuous control with granularities of approximately $0.05$~bits/4D for spectral efficiency and $0.1$~dB for the post-FEC SNR threshold, and a maximum control depth of $12.5$~dB.

To address this challenge, an ultrasonic flow meter was designed and developed, capable of simultaneously measuring both flow velocity and fluid level. To improve measurement accuracy, a flow profile correction factor (FPCF) was derived based on the velocity distribution characteristics and applied to the raw flow meter output. A dedicated open-channel flow loop incorporating a 250 mm diameter pipe was constructed to test and calibrate the system under controlled conditions. Flow rates in the loop varied from 2 to 6 liters per second. The accuracy of the flow meter was evaluated using the Flow-Weighted Mean Error (FWME) metric. Experimental results showed that applying the FPCF significantly improved accuracy, reducing the maximum flow measurement error from 8.51% to 2.44%. Furthermore, calibration led to a substantial decrease in FWME from 1.78% to 0.08%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The flow meter was also subjected to clogging scenarios by artificially obstructing the flow. Under these conditions, the device was able to reliably measure the flow and successfully detected the clogging, triggering an alarm to the operator to take necessary action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d41\u901f\u548c\u6db2\u4f4d\u7684\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\u6d41\u91cf\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u91cf\u5256\u9762\u4fee\u6b63\u56e0\u5b50(FPCF)\u6765\u6539\u5584\u90e8\u5206\u586b\u5145\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6700\u5927\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece8.51%\u964d\u81f32.44%\u3002", "motivation": "\u90e8\u5206\u586b\u5145\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u6bd4\u5b8c\u5168\u586b\u5145\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u5185\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6d41\u901f\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d41\u901f\u548c\u6db2\u4f4d\u7684\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\u6d41\u91cf\u8ba1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u901f\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6d41\u91cf\u5256\u9762\u4fee\u6b63\u56e0\u5b50(FPCF)\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6d41\u91cf\u8ba1\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5728250mm\u76f4\u5f84\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u660e\u6e20\u6d41\u91cf\u56de\u8def\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528FPCF\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece8.51%\u964d\u81f32.44%\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u540eFWME\u4ece1.78%\u964d\u81f30.08%\u3002\u5728\u5835\u585e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d41\u91cf\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5835\u585e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u586b\u5145\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u6d41\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6d41\u91cf\u8ba1\u5728\u5835\u585e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e76\u89e6\u53d1\u8b66\u62a5\u3002"}}

However, conventional MA implementations often adopt fully digital beamforming (FDB), which requires a dedicated RF chain for each antenna. This requirement significantly increase hardware costs, making such systems impractical for multi-antenna deployments. To address this, hardware-efficient analog beamforming (AB) offers a cost-effective alternative. This paper investigates the physical layer security (PLS) in an MA-enabled multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system with an emphasis on AB. In this scenario, an MA-enabled transmitter with AB broadcasts common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, while a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our objective is to maximize the multicast secrecy rate (MSR) by jointly optimizing the phase shifts of the AB and the positions of the MAs, subject to constraints on the movement area of the MAs and the constant modulus (CM) property of the analog phase shifters. This MSR maximization problem is highly challenging, as we have formally proven it to be NP-hard. To solve it efficiently, we propose a penalty constrained product manifold (PCPM) framework. Specifically, we first reformulate the position constraints as a penalty function, enabling unconstrained optimization on a product manifold space (PMS), and then propose a parallel conjugate gradient descent algorithm to efficiently update the variables. Simulation results demonstrate that MA-enabled systems with AB can achieve a well-balanced performance in terms of MSR and hardware costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u591a\u64ad\u4fdd\u5bc6\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u9700\u8981\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5929\u7ebf\u914d\u5907\u4e13\u7528\u5c04\u9891\u94fe\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u60e9\u7f5a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e58\u79ef\u6d41\u5f62\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4e58\u79ef\u6d41\u5f62\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u5171\u8f6d\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u64ad\u4fdd\u5bc6\u7387\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u62df\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4e0e\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To enhance service reliability in remote areas, this paper proposes a hybrid satellite architecture for task offloading that combines Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and LEO satellites. We develop an optimization framework to maximize task offloading admission rate while balancing the energy consumption and delay requirements. Accounting for satellite visibility and limited computing resources, our approach integrates dynamic path selection with frequency and computational resource allocation. Because the formulated problem is NP-hard, we reformulate it into a mixed-integer convex form using disjunctive constraints and convex relaxation techniques, enabling efficient use of off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Simulation results show that, compared to a standalone LEO network, the proposed hybrid LEO-MEO architecture improves the task admission rate by 15\\% and reduces the average delay by 12\\%. These findings highlight the architecture's potential to enhance connectivity and user experience in remote Arctic areas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408MEO\u548cLEO\u536b\u661f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u5165\u7387\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u6781\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eafLEO\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u534715%\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u5165\u7387\u548c\u964d\u4f4e12%\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5317\u6781\u5730\u533a\u7531\u4e8eLEO\u536b\u661f\u8986\u76d6\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ba1\u7b97\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u51c6\u5165\u7387\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u536b\u661f\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5c06NP-hard\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u51f8\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eafLEO\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6df7\u5408LEO-MEO\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u5165\u7387\u63d0\u9ad815%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e12%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u5317\u6781\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

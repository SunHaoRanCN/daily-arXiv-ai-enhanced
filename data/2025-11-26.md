Abstract: Reliable modeling of block error rate in vehicle-to-everything wireless networks is critical for designing robust communication systems under dynamic mobility and diverse channel conditions. Traditional machine learning approaches, such as deep neural networks, achieve high predictive accuracy but lack interpretability and impose significant computational costs, limiting their applicability in real-time, resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose a stabilized symbolic regression framework to derive compact, analytically interpretable expressions for block error rate prediction. Trained on realistic vehicle-to-everything simulation data, the symbolic regression framework for vehicle-to-everything model accurately captures nonlinear dependencies on key system parameters, including signal-to-noise ratio, relative velocity, modulation and coding schemes, number of demodulation reference signal symbols, and environmental factors (line of sight/non-line of sight). Our final symbolic expression comprises only 158 nodes, enabling ultra-fast inference suitable for embedded deployment. On the test set, the symbolic regression framework for vehicle-to-everything model achieves a coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.8684$ and mean squared error $= 2.08 \times 10^{-2}$ in the original block error rate domain, outperforming conventional fixed-form regressions and offering comparable accuracy to neural networks while remaining fully interpretable. Overall, the proposed Stabilized Symbolic Regression Framework for V2X combines predictive performance, physical fidelity, and computational efficiency thus providing a powerful tool for real-time V2X communication system design, adaptive resource allocation, and rapid scenario evaluation.

Abstract: Phase-Based Ranging (PBR) offers several advantages for estimating distances between wirelessly connected devices, including high accuracy over large distances and the removal of the need for antenna arrays at each transceiver. This study investigates the use of Neural Network (NN)-based models for accurate PBR in three distinct environments: Openfield, Office, and Near Buildings, comparing their performance with established non-NN methods. A novel 2NN Model is proposed, integrating two neural networks: one to classify the environment and another to predict distances. Performance was evaluated over 20 trials for each method and dataset using root mean square error (RMSE) and maximum prediction error.
  Results show that the 2NN Model consistently outperformed other methods, frequently ranking among the top methods in minimizing both RMSE and maximum error. In addition, the 2NN Model achieved the best average RMSE and the lowest maximum error. To assess the effect of environment misclassification, filtered versions of the NN models were evaluated by omitting misclassified measurements prior to RMSE calculation. Although unsuitable for production use, the filtered models revealed that misclassifications in the 2NN Model had a significant impact. Its filtered variant achieved the lowest RMSE and maximum error across all datasets, and ranked first in the frequency of attaining the lowest maximum error over 20 trials.
  Overall, the findings show that NN models deliver robust, high-accuracy ranging across diverse environments, outperforming non-NN methods and reinforcing their potential as universal PBR solutions when trained on comprehensive distance datasets.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的联合源信道编码方法，专门针对5G上行链路中非均匀分布的HARQ-ACK比特，通过新型训练算法和功率整形技术，显著降低了传输功率需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信道编码假设物理层输入比特均匀分布，但HARQ-ACK比特本质上是非均匀分布的。对于此类信源，采用联合源信道编码可以获得显著的性能增益。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的编码器，采用新型"免费午餐"训练算法和每码字功率整形技术；开发了Neyman-Pearson测试的扩展版本，在解码器中实现NACK比特相对于ACK比特的不等错误保护。

Result: 与5G NR基线相比，在达到目标错误率时，平均传输功率降低了3-6 dB，最大传输功率降低了2-3 dB，提供了显著的覆盖增益和功率节省。

Conclusion: 所提出的编码器和解码器设计在5G NR兼容的上行链路设置中表现出色，为HARQ-ACK传输提供了高效的解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Channel coding from 2G to 5G has assumed the inputs bits at the physical layer to be uniformly distributed. However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel "free-lunch" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings.

### [6] [Cross-Modal Semantic Communication for Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20000)

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶协作感知中因车辆传感器异构性导致的通信框架设计困难和信息融合效率低下的问题。

Result: 在低信噪比条件下，CMSC相比现有方法显著提升了感知性能。

Conclusion: CMSC框架能够有效促进异构传感器配置车辆间的协作感知，在恶劣通信环境下仍能保持优越性能。

Abstract: Collaborative perception, an emerging paradigm in autonomous driving, has been introduced to mitigate the limitations of single-vehicle systems, such as limited sensor range and occlusion. To improve the robustness of inter-vehicle data sharing, semantic communication has recently further been integrated into collaborative perception systems to enhance overall performance. However, practical deployment of such systems is challenged by the heterogeneity of sensors across different connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This diversity in perceptual data complicates the design of a unified communication framework and impedes the effective fusion of shared information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-modal semantic communication (CMSC) framework to facilitate effective collaboration among CAVs with disparate sensor configurations. Specifically, the framework first transforms heterogeneous perceptual features from different sensor modalities into a unified and standardized semantic space. Subsequently, encoding, transmission, and decoding are performed within this semantic space, enabling seamless and effective information fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMSC achieves significantly stronger perception performance than existing methods, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.

### [7] [Redefining Radar Segmentation: Simultaneous Static-Moving Segmentation and Ego-Motion Estimation using Radar Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20003)
*Simin Zhu,Satish Ravindran,Alexander Yarovoy,Francesco Fioranelli*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于神经网络的方法，能够同时从雷达点云中分割静态和动态物体，并估计移动平台的瞬时2D速度，无需复杂的中间信号处理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统雷达分割研究主要关注移动物体的类别标签，但雷达与光学传感器的本质差异使得类别标签预测的可靠性不同。在汽车雷达感知任务中，判断物体是静态还是动态是大多数任务的先决条件。

Method: 使用多层感知机(MLPs)和循环神经网络(RNNs)等简单有效的构建块进行特征提取，直接从原始点云中提取所需信息，无需点云聚合、多普勒补偿、运动补偿等中间处理步骤。

Result: 在真实世界雷达数据集RadarScenes上进行测试，结果表明该方法在双重任务上表现良好，并在其他雷达感知任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法首次在文献中实现同时分割静态和动态物体并估计平台速度的双重任务，证明了直接从原始雷达点云提取所需信息的可行性。

Abstract: Conventional radar segmentation research has typically focused on learning category labels for different moving objects. Although fundamental differences between radar and optical sensors lead to differences in the reliability of predicting accurate and consistent category labels, a review of common radar perception tasks in automotive reveals that determining whether an object is moving or static is a prerequisite for most tasks. To fill this gap, this study proposes a neural network based solution that can simultaneously segment static and moving objects from radar point clouds. Furthermore, since the measured radial velocity of static objects is correlated with the motion of the radar, this approach can also estimate the instantaneous 2D velocity of the moving platform or vehicle (ego motion). However, despite performing dual tasks, the proposed method employs very simple yet effective building blocks for feature extraction: multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In addition to being the first of its kind in the literature, the proposed method also demonstrates the feasibility of extracting the information required for the dual task directly from unprocessed point clouds, without the need for cloud aggregation, Doppler compensation, motion compensation, or any other intermediate signal processing steps. To measure its performance, this study introduces a set of novel evaluation metrics and tests the proposed method using a challenging real world radar dataset, RadarScenes. The results show that the proposed method not only performs well on the dual tasks, but also has broad application potential in other radar perception tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于RKHS正则化优化的MIMO-OFDM信道估计方法，利用延迟-波束空间的带稀疏性，通过FBS算法实现准线性计算复杂度，并通过深度展开技术提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性信道估计方法（如LMMSE）在MIMO-OFDM系统中性能有限，需要利用信道在延迟-波束空间的稀疏特性来提高估计精度和下游性能。

Method: 在RKHS中构建正则化优化问题，利用表示定理转化为有限维问题，采用FBS算法求解，并引入深度展开技术加速收敛。

Conclusion: 所提出的RKHS正则化信道估计方法能有效利用信道稀疏性，在保持准线性计算复杂度的同时显著提升MIMO-OFDM系统的信道估计性能。

Abstract: We propose a method for channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless communication systems. The method exploits the band-sparsity of wireless channels in the delay-beamspace domain by solving a regularized optimization problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). A suitable representer theorem allows us to transform the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one, which we then approximate with a low-dimensional surrogate. We solve the resulting optimization problem using a forward-backward splitting (FBS)-based algorithm. By exploiting the problem's modulation structure, we achieve a computational complexity per iteration that is quasi-linear in the number of unknown variables. We also propose a data-driven deep-unfolding based extension to improve the performance at a reduced number of iterations. We evaluate our channel estimators on ray-traced channels generated with SionnaRT. The results show that our methods significantly outperform linear methods such as linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation based on aggregate channel statistics, both in terms of raw estimation accuracy as well as in downstream performance.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文将比特分割过程集成到ChannelComp框架中，通过将输入比特序列分割成多个组，每组映射为单个调制符号，在多时隙中传输编码符号序列，以降低调制设计复杂度并提高计算可靠性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了降低数字空中计算的调制设计复杂度，同时提高计算可靠性，需要改进现有的ChannelComp框架。

Method: 开发了两种比特分割方法：均匀比特分割（通过max-min优化设计调制，使用CCCP处理二阶锥规划子问题）和重要性自适应比特分割（IABP，根据比特位置的重要性调整比特分配，联合优化调制和分割）。

Result: 数值结果表明，两种方法在噪声信道中都能提供稳健的计算，IABP相比Sequential Modulation for AirComp在乘积计算中可将计算误差降低达5 dB。

Conclusion: 集成比特分割的ChannelComp框架能有效降低设计复杂度并提高计算可靠性，特别是IABP方法在乘积计算中表现优异。

Abstract: For digital over-the-air computation, the ChannelComp framework has recently been proposed to design digital modulations to compute any arbitrary function over a multiple access channel. To reduce modulation design complexity while increasing computation reliability, this paper integrates a bit-partitioning procedure into ChannelComp. The key process is to partition the input bit sequence into several groups, map each group to a single modulation symbol and transmit the encoded symbol sequence across multiple time slots. With the objective to maximize a worst-case constellation distance, we develop two bit-partitioning methods. In uniform bit-partitioning, bits are evenly distributed across groups and modulation is designed via a max-min optimization, which is handled by a CCCP that solves a sequence of second-order cone programming subproblems. In importance-adaptive bit-partitioning (IABP), the bit allocation is adapted to the significance of individual bit positions, and the modulation and partitioning are jointly optimized. To keep the overall complexity manageable, simulated annealing is employed in the outer loop to update the partitioning, while a CCCP-based solver is used in the inner loop for modulation design. Numerical results show that both methods provide robust computation in noisy channels, and IABP achieves up to a 5 dB reduction in computation error compared to Sequential Modulation for AirComp, especially for product computation.

Abstract: A novel continuous-aperture-array (CAPA)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed. Specifically, an optimal continuous ISAC waveform is designed to form a directive beampattern for multi-target sensing while suppressing the multi-user interference (MUI). To achieve the goal of optimal waveform design, the directional beampattern of CAPA is first derived based on Green's function, whereafter a reference sensing waveform is obtained through wavenumber-domain optimization. Based on the reference sensing waveform, a weighted functional programming on the tradeoff between sensing beampattern mismatch and MUI is formulated. To solve the resulting problem, an optimal CAPA-ISAC waveform structure is analytically derived using a Lagrangian-transformation and calculus-of-variations method, where the Lagrangian multiplier associated with the optimal waveform structure is determined via Bisection search. The obtained optimal waveform reveals that it is concurrently affected by the reference sensing waveform, the channel correlations and the channel-symbol correlations. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed system and waveform design, demonstrating that CAPA can achieve significant performance gains against the ISAC designs based on conventional spatially discrete array in both sensing accuracy and communication reliability.

Abstract: This paper proposes a flow matching (FM) framework based on rectified flow for vision-aided beam prediction in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. Instead of modeling discrete beam index sequences, the method learns a continuous latent flow governed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based vector field, enabling smooth beam trajectories and fast sampling. A terminal flow constraint enforces global consistency under finite-step integration, stabilizing long-term prediction. The resulting FM-based model significantly improves top-K accuracy over RNN and LSTM baselines, approaches the performance of large language model-based approaches, and achieves inference speedups on the order of 10 x and 10^4 x on identical GPU and CPU deployments, respectively.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), which is recognized as a key enabler for sixth generation (6G), has brought new opportunities for intelligent, sustainable, and connected wireless networks. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transceiver technology lies at the core of this paradigm, providing the degrees of freedom required for simultaneous data transmission and accurate radar sensing. The tight integration of sensing and communication introduces unique security vulnerabilities that extend beyond conventional physical-layer security (PLS). In particular, high-power transmissions directed at sensing targets may empower adversarial eavesdroppers, whereas passive interception of ISAC echoes can reveal sensitive information such as target locations and mobility patterns. This article presents an overview of recent advances in MIMO ISAC transceiver design, considering transmitter perspectives, receiver architectures, and full-duplex implementations. We examine MIMO transceiver designs under unique security threats specific to ISAC and highlight emerging countermeasures, including secure signaling design, interference exploitation, and transceiver optimization under adversarial conditions. Finally, we discuss challenges and research opportunities for developing secure ISAC systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: High-precision wireless localization in urban canyons is challenged by noisy measurements and severe non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. This paper proposes a robust three-stage algorithm synergizing a digital twin (DT) model with the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to overcome these limitations. The method leverages the DT for geometric path association and employs RANSAC to identify reliable line-of-sight (LOS) and single-bounce NLOS paths while rejecting multi-bounce outliers. A final optimization on the resulting inlier set estimates the user's position and clock bias. Simulations validate that by effectively turning NLOS paths into valuable geometric information via the DT, the approach enables accurate localization, reduces reliance on direct LOS, and significantly lowers system deployment costs, making it suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Passive acoustic mapping enables the spatial mapping and temporal monitoring of cavitation activity, playing a crucial role in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Most conventional beamforming methods, whether implemented in the time or frequency domains, suffer from limited axial resolution due to the absence of a reference emission onset time. While frequency-domain methods, the most efficient of which are based on the cross-spectral matrix, require long signals for accurate estimation, time-domain methods typically achieve lower spatial resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a linear model-based beamforming framework fully formulated in the time domain. The linear forward model relates a discretized spatiotemporal distribution of cavitation activity to the temporal signals recorded by a probe, explicitly accounting for time-of-flight delays dictated by the acquisition geometry. This model is then inverted using regularization techniques that exploit prior knowledge of cavitation activity in both spatial and temporal domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves enhanced or competitive cavitation map quality while using only 20\% of the data typically required by frequency-domain methods. This highlights the substantial gain in data efficiency and the flexibility of our spatiotemporal regularization to adapt to diverse passive cavitation scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种广义的近场MIMO信道模型，扩展了点散射框架以考虑大表面的非完美反射，并证明在近场多用户场景中仅依赖LOS链路可能无法实现复用增益，必须利用NLOS链路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有近场信道模型基于点散射假设，不适用于墙壁、天花板等大反射体。在近场MIMO系统中，虽然LOS链路通常占主导，但NLOS链路对实现复用增益至关重要，且其影响不可忽略。

Method: 开发了广义统计近场MIMO信道模型，扩展点散射框架以包含大表面的非完美反射，分析反射体物理特性对信道的影响，并在多用户场景中理论分析LOS和NLOS链路的复用能力。

Result: 仿真验证了所提模型的准确性，表明在许多实际场景中NLOS分量的贡献不可忽略，必须仔细考虑在系统设计中。理论分析证明仅依赖LOS近场链路可能不足以实现复用增益。

Conclusion: 提出的广义近场MIMO信道模型能更准确地描述大反射体的影响，在多用户近场通信中，必须同时利用LOS和NLOS链路才能实现有效的复用增益。

Abstract: Near-field (NF) communications is receiving renewed interest in the context of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems involving large physical apertures with respect to the signal wavelength. While line-of-sight (LOS) links are typically expected to dominate in NF scenarios, the impact of non-LOS (NLOS) components at both in centimeter- and millimeter-wave frequencies may be in general non-negligible. Moreover, although weaker than the LOS path, NLOS links may be essential for achieving multiplexing gains in MIMO systems. The commonly used NF channel models for NLOS links in the literature are based on the point scattering assumption, which is not valid for large reflectors such as walls, ceilings, and the ground. In this paper, we develop a generalized statistical NF MIMO channel model that extends the widely adopted point scattering framework to account for imperfect reflections from large surfaces. This model is then leveraged to investigate how the physical characteristics of these reflectors influence the resulting NF MIMO channel. In addition, using the proposed channel model, we analytically demonstrate for a multi-user scenario that, even when users are located within the NF regime, relying solely on LOS NF links may be insufficient to achieve multiplexing gains, thus exploiting NLOS links becomes essential. Our simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed model and show that, in many practical settings, the contribution of NLOS components is non-negligible and must be carefully accounted for in the system design.

### [18] [BERT-APC: A Reference-free Framework for Automatic Pitch Correction via Musical Context Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20006)
*Sungjae Kim,Kihyun Na,Jinyoung Choi,Injung Kim*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: BERT-APC是一个无参考的自动音高校正框架，通过结合音乐语言模型来校正音高误差，同时保持演唱的自然表现力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有APC系统要么依赖参考音高，限制了实际应用性，要么使用简单的音高估计算法，往往无法保持表现力和自然度。

Method: 使用固定音高预测器估计感知音高，上下文感知音符音高预测器通过音乐语言模型估计目标音高序列，以及音符级校正算法在保留情感表达的同时修正音高误差。

Result: 在高度失谐样本上，BERT-APC在原始音高准确率上比第二好的模型ROSVOT高出10.49%。MOS测试中得分为4.32±0.15，显著高于AutoTune(3.22±0.18)和Melodyne(3.08±0.18)。

Conclusion: 这是第一个利用音乐语言模型实现无参考音高校正并包含符号音乐上下文的APC模型，在保持表现力的同时显著提升了音高校正性能。

Abstract: Automatic Pitch Correction (APC) enhances vocal recordings by aligning pitch deviations with the intended musical notes. However, existing APC systems either rely on reference pitches, which limits their practical applicability, or employ simple pitch estimation algorithms that often fail to preserve expressiveness and naturalness. We propose BERT-APC, a novel reference-free APC framework that corrects pitch errors while maintaining the natural expressiveness of vocal performances. In BERT-APC, a novel stationary pitch predictor first estimates the perceived pitch of each note from the detuned singing voice. A context-aware note pitch predictor estimates the intended pitch sequence by leveraging a music language model repurposed to incorporate musical context. Finally, a note-level correction algorithm fixes pitch errors while preserving intentional pitch deviations for emotional expression. In addition, we introduce a learnable data augmentation strategy that improves the robustness of the music language model by simulating realistic detuning patterns. Compared to two recent singing voice transcription models, BERT-APC demonstrated superior performance in note pitch prediction, outperforming the second-best model, ROSVOT, by 10.49%p on highly detuned samples in terms of the raw pitch accuracy. In the MOS test, BERT-APC achieved the highest score of $4.32 \pm 0.15$, which is significantly higher than those of the widely-used commercial APC tools, AutoTune ($3.22 \pm 0.18$) and Melodyne ($3.08 \pm 0.18$), while maintaining a comparable ability to preserve expressive nuances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first APC model that leverages a music language model to achieve reference-free pitch correction with symbolic musical context. The corrected audio samples of BERT-APC are available online.

TL;DR: 评估神经音频编解码器时，现有客观质量指标与人类感知的相关性存在差异，部分指标表现良好，部分则难以捕捉相关失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经音频编解码器在生成建模中应用广泛，但人类听力研究耗时且不实用，需要可靠的客观质量评估指标。

Method: 对高保真语音信号进行MUSHRA听力测试，分析主观评分与常用客观指标之间的相关性。

Result: 部分指标与人类感知一致，但其他指标难以捕捉相关失真。

Conclusion: 为使用神经音频编解码器进行语音处理时选择合适的评估指标提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs have gained recent popularity for their use in generative modeling as they offer high-fidelity audio reconstruction at low bitrates. While human listening studies remain the gold standard for assessing perceptual quality, they are time-consuming and impractical. In this work, we examine the reliability of existing objective quality metrics in assessing the performance of recent neural audio codecs. To this end, we conduct a MUSHRA listening test on high-fidelity speech signals and analyze the correlation between subjective scores and widely used objective metrics. Our results show that, while some metrics align well with human perception, others struggle to capture relevant distortions. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting appropriate evaluation metrics when using neural audio codecs for speech.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech synthesis and voice conversion technologies has raised significant security concerns in multimedia forensics. Although current detection models demonstrate impressive performance, they struggle to maintain effectiveness against constantly evolving deepfake attacks. Additionally, continually fine-tuning these models using historical training data incurs substantial computational and storage costs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that incorporates Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) into audio deepfake detection, enabling models to retain knowledge of historical spoofing distribution without direct access to past data. Our method integrates UAP seamlessly with pre-trained self-supervised audio models during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its potential as an efficient solution for continual learning in audio deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Duo-Tok是一个面向人声-伴奏音乐的双码本分词器，通过四阶段SSL流程平衡重建质量与语言模型学习能力，在0.75kbps码率下实现了重建-生成的帕累托前沿优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有歌词转歌曲系统中重建质量与语言模型学习能力之间的张力，现有编解码器要么优先高保真重建但难以建模，要么压缩过度导致语义损失，且缺乏对双轨结构的感知。

Method: 四阶段自监督学习流程：1) 在大规模音频上预训练BEST-RQ风格编码器；2) 使用高斯替换噪声和多任务监督稳定和分解表示；3) 冻结编码器学习基于SimVQ的双码本，对人声和伴奏进行硬路由；4) 在离散标记上训练潜在扩散解码器。

Result: 在0.75kbps码率下，Duo-Tok在重建-生成帕累托前沿上取得最佳表现，获得最高的音乐标签平均精度和最低的词汇归一化语言模型困惑度，同时保持与最先进音乐分词器相当的重建质量。

Conclusion: Duo-Tok通过源感知的双码本设计和SSL流程，成功平衡了音乐重建质量与语言模型学习能力，为歌词转歌曲系统提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Duo-Tok is a source-aware dual-codebook tokenizer for vocal-accompaniment music that targets the growing tension between reconstruction quality and language-model (LM) learnability in modern lyrics-to-song systems. Existing codecs either prioritize high-fidelity reconstruction with difficult-to-model acoustic tokens or compress aggressively into semantic tokens that are LM-friendly but lossy, and they rarely make the tokenizer itself aware of dual-track structure. Duo-Tok follows a four-stage, SSL-centered pipeline: we first pretrain a BEST-RQ-style encoder on large-scale audio, then stabilize and factorize the representation with Gaussian replacement noise and multi-task supervision, before freezing the encoder to learn SimVQ-based dual codebooks with hard routing for vocals and accompaniment, and finally training latent diffusion decoders on top of the discrete tokens. Duo-Tok at 0.75 kbps shifts the empirical reconstruction-generation Pareto frontier, achieving the best music-tagging AP and the lowest vocabulary-normalized LM perplexity among compared codecs while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to state-of-the-art music tokenizers.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for designing attenuation filters in digital audio reverberation systems based on Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs). Our approach uses Second Order Sections (SOS) of Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters arranged as parametric equalizers (PEQ), enabling fine control over frequency-dependent reverberation decay. Unlike traditional graphic equalizer designs, which require numerous filters per delay line, we propose a scalable solution where the number of filters can be adjusted. The frequency, gain, and quality factor (Q) parameters are shared parameters across delay lines and only the gain is adjusted based on delay length. This design not only reduces the number of optimization parameters, but also remains fully differentiable and compatible with gradient-based learning frameworks. Leveraging principles of analog filter design, our method allows for efficient and accurate filter fitting using supervised learning. Our method delivers a flexible and differentiable design, achieving state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational cost.

Abstract: Extracting individual elements from music mixtures is a valuable tool for music production and practice. While neural networks optimized to mask or transform mixture spectrograms into the individual source(s) have been the leading approach, the source overlap and correlation in music signals poses an inherent challenge. Also, accessing all sources in the mixture is crucial to train these systems, while complicated. Attempts to address these challenges in a generative fashion exist, however, the separation performance and inference efficiency remain limited. In this work, we study the potential of diffusion models to advance toward bridging this gap, focusing on generative singing voice separation relying only on corresponding pairs of isolated vocals and mixtures for training. To align with creative workflows, we leverage latent diffusion: the system generates samples encoded in a compact latent space, and subsequently decodes these into audio. This enables efficient optimization and faster inference. Our system is trained using only open data. We outperform existing generative separation systems, and level the compared non-generative systems on a list of signal quality measures and on interference removal. We provide a noise robustness study on the latent encoder, providing insights on its potential for the task. We release a modular toolkit for further research on the topic.

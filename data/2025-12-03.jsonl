Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN). These results demonstrate the importance of modeling multiple, co-occurring context dimensions to improve the accuracy and robustness of mobile context recognition."}

However, unlocking the full potential of ultra-short pulse lasers requires an optimized monitoring system capable of early detection of defective workpieces, regardless of the preprocessing technique employed. While advances in machine learning can help predict process quality features, the complexity of monitoring data necessitates reducing both model size and data dimensionality to enable real-time analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a machine learning framework designed to enhance surface quality assessment across diverse preprocessing techniques. To facilitate real-time laser processing monitoring, our solution aims to optimize the computational requirements of the machine learning model. Experimental results show that the proposed model not only outperforms the generalizability achieved by previous works across diverse preprocessing techniques but also significantly reduces the computational requirements for training. Through these advancements, we aim to establish the baseline for a more sustainable manufacturing process."}

Two critical challenges remain:(1)a low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates, making it difficult to learn seizure-related interactions; and (2)expert labels for spatial pathological connectivity patterns are difficult to obtain, meanwhile lacking the patterns' representation to improve seizure detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel node-graph dual contrastive learning framework, Seizure-NGCLNet, to learn SEEG interictal suppression and ictal propagation patterns for detecting DRE seizures with high precision. First, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy guided by centrality metrics is developed to generate seizure-related brain networks. Second, a dual-contrastive learning approach is integrated, combining global graph-level contrast with local node-graph contrast, to encode both spatial structural and semantic epileptogenic features. Third, the pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned via a top-k localized graph attention network to perform the final classification. Extensive experiments on a large-scale public SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients demonstrate that Seizure-NGCLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy of 95.93%, sensitivity of 96.25%, and specificity of 94.12%. Visualizations confirm that the learned embeddings clearly separate ictal from interictal states, reflecting suppression and propagation patterns that correspond to the clinical mechanisms. These results highlight Seizure-NGCLNet's ability to learn interpretable spatial pathological patterns, enhancing both seizure detection and seizure onset zone localization."}

The isotropic nature of transmit distortion due to multiple stream transmission further complicates clutter suppression. To address this, we propose a distortion- and clutter-aware precoding strategy that minimizes the deviation from the communication-optimized precoder while improving sensing robustness. We also propose an alternative power allocation-based approach that reduces computational complexity.

In this paper, we present a deep learning-based interactive continual learning framework for singing voice separation that allows users to fine-tune the vocal separation model to conform it to new target songs. We use a U-Net-based base model architecture that produces a mask for separating vocals from the spectrogram, followed by a human-in-the-loop task where the user provides feedback by marking a few false positives, i.e., regions in the extracted vocals that should have been silence.

Compared with monostatic sensing, multi-access point (AP) collaborative sensing endows mobile networks with broader, more accurate, and resilient sensing capabilities, which are critical for diverse location-based sectors. This paper focuses on collaborative sensing in multi-AP networks and proposes a Bayesian probability fusion framework for target parameter estimation using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing waveform. The framework models multi-AP received signals as probability distributions to capture stochastic observations from channel noise and scattering coefficients. Prior information is then incorporated into the joint probability density function to cast the problem as a constrained maximum a posteriori estimation. To address the high-dimensional optimization, we develop a prior-constrained gradient ascent (PCGA) algorithm that decouples correlated parameters and performs efficient gradient updates guided by the target prior. Theoretical analysis covers optimal fusion weights for global signal-to-noise ratio maximization, PCGA convergence, and the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the estimator, with insights applicable to broader fusion schemes. Extensive numerical simulations and real-world experiments with commercial devices show the framework reduces transmission overhead by 90% versus signal fusion and lowers estimation error by 41% relative to parameter fusion. Notably, field tests achieve submeter accuracy with 50% probability in typical coverage of mmWave APs. These improvements highlight a favorable balance between communication efficiency and estimation accuracy for practical multi-AP sensing deployment.\n  The dataset is released for research purposes and is publicly available at: http://pmldatanet.com.cn/dataapp/multimodal"}

Reverberant indoor environments are particularly important. For real-time applications, room acous-tics simulation requires simplifications, however, the necessary acoustic level of detail (ALOD) remains unclear in order to capture all perceptually relevant effects. This study examines the impact of varying ALOD in simulations of three real environments: a living room with a coupled kitchen, a pub, and an underground station. ALOD was varied by generating different numbers of image sources for early reflections, or by excluding geo-metrical room details specific for each environment. Simulations were perceptually eval-uated using headphones in comparison to binaural room impulse responses measured with a dummy head in the corresponding real environments, or by using loudspeakers. The study assessed the perceived overall difference for a pulse stimulus, a played electric bass and a speech token. Additionally, plausibility, speech intelligibility, and externaliza-tion were evaluated. Results indicate that a strong reduction in ALOD is feasible while maintaining similar plausibility, speech intelligibility, and externalization as with dummy head recordings. The number and accuracy of early reflections appear less relevant, pro-vided diffuse late reverberation is appropriately represented."}

To address these issues, we propose VibOmni, a lightweight, end-to-end multi-modal speech enhancement system for earables that leverages bone-conducted vibrations captured by widely available Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). VibOmni integrates a two-branch encoder-decoder deep neural network to fuse audio and vibration features. To overcome the scarcity of paired audio-vibration datasets, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique that models Bone Conduction Functions (BCFs) from limited recordings, enabling synthetic vibration data generation with only 4.5% spectrogram similarity error.

In the considered system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate within a structured air corridor composed of connected cubic segments, and multiple BSs need to be selectively deployed at a set of candidate locations to ensure both sensing and communication coverage throughout the corridor. In particular, we leverage the channel knowledge map (CKM) to characterize wireless channels for candidate BS sites prior to deployment, thereby facilitating the offline planning. Under this setup, we minimize the system cost in terms of the weighted sum of the air corridor length and the number of deployed BSs, subject to the constraints on both sensing and communication performance across the corridor. To solve the formulated large-scale nonconvex integer programming problem, we develop a hierarchical coarse-to-fine grid decomposition algorithm.

However, CSI acquisition in FR3 systems faces significant challenges: the increased number of antennas and wider transmission bandwidth introduces prohibitive training overhead with traditional estimation approaches, as each probing captures only incomplete spatial-frequency observation, while higher carrier frequencies lead to faster temporal channel variation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI acquisition framework that integrates CSI feedback, uplink (UL) and DL channel estimation, as well as channel prediction in the FR3 TDD massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we first develop the Joint UL and DL Channel Estimation Network (JUDCEN) to fuse incomplete observations based on the SRSs and CSI-RSs. By exploiting the complementary characteristics of preliminary UL and DL estimation features, obtained through initial UL estimation and quantized-feedback-assisted DL estimation, it enables full CSI reconstruction in the spatial domain. To mitigate the performance degradation in the feedback process, we propose the Transformer-MLP CSI Feedback Network (TMCFN), employing an MLP-based module to jointly exploit angle- and delay-domain features. Building upon the reconstructed full CSI, we further develop the Mamba-based Channel Prediction Network (MCPN), which exploits selective state-space model (SSM) mechanism to capture long-range temporal dynamics in the angle-delay domain for future CSI prediction.

This work investigates unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods for automatically defining and dynamically reconfiguring sonic behaviour spaces during QD search. We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and autoencoders to project high-dimensional audio features onto structured grids for MAP-Elites, implementing dynamic reconfiguration through model retraining at regular intervals. Comparison across two experimental scenarios shows that automatic approaches achieve significantly greater diversity than handcrafted behaviour spaces while avoiding expert-imposed biases. Dynamic behaviour-space reconfiguration maintains evolutionary pressure and prevents stagnation, with PCA proving most effective among the dimensionality reduction techniques.

As an alternative, we consider the problem of characterizing non-linearity-aware ZF (NLA-ZF) precoding schemes, hereby defined as linear precoders that achieve perfect interference cancellation in the presence of PA non-linearity by exploiting knowledge of this non-linear response. We provide initial iterative solutions that allow achieving NLA-ZF (up to adjustable tolerance) in a two-UE downlink MU-MIMO scenario where the base station (BS) has an even number of antennas, and each antenna is connected to a PA exhibiting third-order memory-less non-linear behavior. The proposed approach allows for performance gains in scenarios with significant residual interference."}

The challenge focuses on cross-modal verification under unique multilingual conditions, specifically unseen and unheard languages. Our approach investigates two distinct architectures, consisting of a baseline dual-encoder system trained from scratch using contrastive and orthogonal projection losses, and a foundation model approach leveraging ImageBind with LoRA. To address the data scarcity and language constraints of the challenge, we curated an external Arabic dataset from VoxBlink. Our best-performing system, ImageBind-LoRA, demonstrates remarkable cross-lingual generalization: despite being fine-tuned exclusively on Arabic audio, it achieved an EER of 24.73% on the evaluation set (English and German), securing 2nd place in the competition."}

Low-cost, switch-based architectures have recently emerged as a potential alternative. However, prior studies rely on simplified models that ignore (among others) antenna coupling, radiation patterns, and matching losses, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions. In this paper, we use a physically consistent electromagnetic modeling framework to analyze an ultra-dense patch-antenna array architecture that performs joint beamforming and matching using networks of inexpensive RF switches. Our results demonstrate that simple, switch-based beamforming architectures can approach the antenna-gain of all-digital solutions at significantly lower cost and complexity."}

This paper presents a Generalizable Physics-Informed Fourier Neural Network (G-PIFNN) framework that enhances PINN architectures for efficient and interpretable electrical circuit analysis. The proposed G-PIFNN introduces three key advancements: (1) improved performance and interpretability via a physics activation function (PAF) and a lightweight Physics-Informed Fourier Neural Network (PIFNN) architecture; (2) automated, bond graph (BG) based formulation of physics-informed loss functions for systematic differential equation generation; and (3) integration of intra-circuit and cross-circuit class transfer learning (TL) strategies, enabling unsupervised fine-tuning for rapid adaptation to varying circuit topologies. Numerical simulations demonstrate that G-PIFNN achieves significantly better predictive performance and generalization across diverse circuit classes, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to standard PINNs."}

However, most existing CKM construction methods formulate the task as an image super-resolution or generation problem, thereby employing models originally developed for computer vision. As a result, the generated CKMs often fail to capture the underlying physical characteristics of wireless propagation. In this paper, we focus on the construction of CKM for large-scale fading scenarios and design three physics-based constraint terms to characterize the spatial distribution patterns of large-scale fading. By integrating these physical constraints with a state-of-the-art diffusion model that possesses superior generative capability, a physics-inspired diffusion model for CKM construction is proposed. Following this motivation, we derive the loss function of the diffusion model augmented with physics-based constraint terms and further design the training and generation framework for the proposed physics-inspired CKM generation diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms all existing methods in terms of construction accuracy. Moreover, the proposed model provides a unified and effective framework with strong potential for generating diverse, accurate, and physically consistent CKM."}

Over the past decade, these findings have been replicated using the Brain Age paradigm, which applies machine learning techniques to estimate brain age from neuroimaging data. This approach yields a single index, the Brain Age Gap, defined as the difference between predicted and chronological age. Nevertheless, both the progressive nature of this phenomenon and the potential role of antipsychotic medication remain unclear. To investigate its progression, we compared the Brain Age Gap between individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis and healthy controls using ANCOVA, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and estimated total intracranial volume. To enhance the robustness of our findings, we employed two distinct models: a transformer-inspired model based on harmonized volumetric brain features extracted with FastSurfer, and a previously trained deep learning model. To assess the potential effect of medication, we further compared bipolar patients who received antipsychotic treatment with those who did not. Mann-Whitney U test consistently showed that medicated bipolar patients did not exhibit a significantly larger Brain Age Gap. Both models converge on the conclusion that accelerated brain aging is unlikely to be explained by antipsychotic medication alone. Longitudinal studies are therefore required to clarify the temporal dynamics of brain aging in schizophrenia."}

Eldar"], "title": "Diffusion-Prior Split Gibbs Sampling for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging under Incomplete Measurements", "comment": null, "summary": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing, yet reconstruction is often challenged by noise, undersampling, and complex scattering scenarios. Conventional methods, including matched filtering and sparsity-based compressed sensing, are limited in capturing intricate scene structures and frequently suffer from artifacts, elevated sidelobes, and loss of fine details. Recent diffusion models have demonstrated superior capability in representing high-order priors; however, existing diffusion-based SAR methods still yield degraded reconstructions due to oversimplified likelihood approximations in guided sampling. In this work, we propose a diffusion-driven split Gibbs sampling framework for SAR reconstruction, rigorously integrating measurement fidelity with learned diffusion priors. By alternately performing likelihood- and prior-driven updates via proximal sampling, this method ensures progressive convergence toward the true posterior while fully leveraging the expressive power of diffusion priors. Extensive experiments on simulated and Sentinel-1A datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements: over 7 dB average PSNR gain in simulations, along with significant sidelobe suppression (MPLSR +2.96 dB, MISLR +11.5 dB) with respect to the best baseline result. On real-world Sentinel-1A data, the method achieves an average PSNR gain of 1.6 dB while effectively reducing artifacts and preserving scene details, including ridges, edges, and fine textures. These results underscore the potential of the adapted framework as a robust and generalizable solution for high-fidelity SAR imaging across diverse sensing scenarios."}

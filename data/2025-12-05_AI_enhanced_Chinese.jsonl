(2024) recently introduced the computationally efficient monaural and binaural audio quality model (eMoBi-Q). This model integrates both monaural and binaural auditory features and has been validated across six audio datasets encompassing quality ratings for music and speech, processed via algorithms commonly employed in modern hearing devices (e.g., acoustic transparency, feedback cancellation, and binaural beamforming) or presented via loudspeakers. In the current study, we expand eMoBi-Q to account for perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss (HL) on audio quality. For this, the model was extended by a nonlinear auditory filterbank. Given that altered loudness perception is a prevalent issue among listeners with hearing impairment, our goal is to incorporate loudness as a sub-dimension for predicting audio quality in both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired populations. While predicting loudness itself is important in the context of loudness-based hearing aid fitting, loudness as audio quality sub-measure may be helpful for the selection of reliable auditory features in hearing impaired listeners. The parameters of the filterbank and subsequent processing stages were informed by the physiologically-based (binaural) loudness model proposed by Pieper et al. (2018).

However, real-world applications often involve more diverse and complex conditions, such as one-speaker-plus-noise or two-speaker-without-noise. To address this challenge, we extend LGTSE with a Cross-Condition Consistency learning strategy, termed TripleC Learning. This strategy is first validated under multi-speaker-plus-noise condition and then evaluated for its generalization across diverse scenarios. Moreover, building upon the lightweight front-end denoiser in LGTSE, which can flexibly process both noisy and clean mixtures and shows strong generalization to unseen conditions, we integrate TripleC learning with a proposed parallel universal training scheme that organizes batches containing multiple scenarios for the same target speaker. By enforcing consistent extraction across different conditions, easier cases can assist harder ones, thereby fully exploiting diverse training data and fostering a robust universal model.

Most existing efforts on APA have predominantly concentrated on highly constrained reading-aloud tasks (where learners are prompted to read a reference text aloud); however, assessing pronunciation quality in unscripted speech (or free-speaking scenarios) remains relatively underexplored. In light of this, we first propose HiPPO, a hierarchical pronunciation assessment model tailored for spoken languages, which evaluates an L2 learner's oral proficiency at multiple linguistic levels based solely on the speech uttered by the learner. To improve the overall accuracy of assessment, a contrastive ordinal regularizer and a curriculum learning strategy are introduced for model training. The former aims to generate score-discriminative features by exploiting the ordinal nature of regression targets, while the latter gradually ramps up the training complexity to facilitate the assessment task that takes unscripted speech as input.

However, achieving high performance is challenging due to emotional complexity and scarce annotated data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-loss learning (MLL) framework integrating an energy-adaptive mixup (EAM) method and a frame-level attention module (FLAM). The EAM method leverages SNR-based augmentation to generate diverse speech samples capturing subtle emotional variations. FLAM enhances frame-level feature extraction for multi-frame emotional cues.

While existing models have made progress, they often degrade in performance when multiple transmitters coexist, due to the compounded effects of shadowing, interference from adjacent transmitters. To address this challenge, we extend our prior work on Physics-Informed Neural Networks~(PINNs) for single-transmitter mapping to derive a new multi-transmitter Partial Differential Equation~(PDE) formulation of the Received Signal Strength Indicator~(RSSI). We then propose \\emph{ReVeal-MT} (Re-constructor and Visualizer of Spectrum Landscape for Multiple Transmitters), a novel PINN which integrates the multi-source PDE residual into a neural network loss function, enabling accurate spectrum landscape reconstruction from sparse RF sensor measurements. ReVeal-MT is validated using real-world measurements from the ARA wireless living lab across rural and suburban environments, and benchmarked against 3GPP and ITU-R channel models and a baseline PINN model for a single transmitter use-case. Results show that ReVeal-MT achieves substantial accuracy gains in multi-transmitter scenarios, e.g., achieving an RMSE of only 2.66\\,dB with as few as 45 samples over a 370-square-kilometer region, while maintaining low computational complexity. These findings demonstrate that ReVeal-MT significantly advances radio environment mapping under realistic multi-transmitter conditions, with strong potential for enabling fine-grained spectrum management and precise coexistence between PUs and SUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faReVeal-MT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(PINN)\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u6e90\u5171\u5b58\u65f6\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u6620\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9891\u8c31\u666f\u89c2\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c04\u6e90\u5171\u5b58\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9634\u5f71\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u76f8\u90bb\u53d1\u5c04\u6e90\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u590d\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u6e90\u9891\u8c31\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e3b\u7528\u6237\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8ba9\u6b21\u7528\u6237\u8bbf\u95ee\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u9891\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u5148\u524d\u5355\u53d1\u5c04\u6e90\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(PINN)\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u6e90\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6307\u793a(RSSI)\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b(PDE)\u516c\u5f0f\u3002\u63d0\u51faReVeal-MT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6e90PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u7684RF\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u9891\u8c31\u666f\u89c2\u3002", "result": "\u5728ARA\u65e0\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u519c\u6751\u548c\u90ca\u533a\u73af\u5883\u3002\u4e0e3GPP\u3001ITU-R\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u53d1\u5c04\u6e90PINN\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002ReVeal-MT\u5728\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728370\u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u533a\u57df\u4ec5\u752845\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5c31\u5b9e\u73b02.66dB\u7684RMSE\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "ReVeal-MT\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9891\u8c31\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4e3b\u6b21\u7528\u6237\u7cbe\u786e\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

However, to meet emerging demands such as high-frequency operation, wide bandwidths, co-existence, integrated sensing, and resilience to dynamic interference, future systems must exhibit both scalability and spectral agility. These requirements place increasing pressure on the underlying processing hardware to be both efficient and reconfigurable. This paper proposes a custom-designed spatial array architecture that serves as a reconfigurable, general-purpose core optimized for a class of wireless kernels that commonly arise in diverse communications and sensing tasks.

Three classes of machine learning approaches - unsupervised, supervised, and explainable - were evaluated. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to extract the first two principal components, which together explained more than 50 percent of the variance. Seven supervised multi-class classifiers were trained and compared, alongside unsupervised and explainable methods. Model development and evaluation used a large auditory reference database containing ACALOS data (N = 847). The PCA factor map showed substantial overlap between listeners, indicating that cleanly separating participants into six Bisgaard classes based solely on their loudness patterns is challenging. Nevertheless, the models demonstrated reasonable classification performance, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy among supervised approaches. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can predict standard Bisgaard audiogram types, within certain limits, from calibration-independent loudness perception data, supporting potential applications in remote or resource-limited settings without requiring a traditional audiogram.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7c7b\u54cd\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e(ACALOS)\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u542c\u8005\u5206\u7c7b\u5230\u6807\u51c6Bisgaard\u542c\u529b\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fdc\u7a0b\u542c\u529b\u5eb7\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fdc\u7a0b\u542c\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u54cd\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e2a\u4f53\u542c\u529b\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u7c7b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5bf9ACALOS\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u524d\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e03\u4e2a\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b847\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5927\u578b\u542c\u89c9\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "PCA\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u663e\u793a\u542c\u8005\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u54cd\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c06\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u4e3a\u516d\u4e2aBisgaard\u7c7b\u522b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u9650\u5ea6\u5185\u4ece\u6821\u51c6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u54cd\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u6807\u51c6Bisgaard\u542c\u529b\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u542c\u529b\u56fe\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

By freely deploying antenna positions along waveguides, the pinching antenna system effectively mitigates the impact of path loss and thus enhances the capacities of sensing and communicating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that fly over a large range. We first model the problem of maximizing the sensing performance of multiple targets while satisfying the communication performance requirements of multiple users, where both the targets and users are UAVs. For mitigating in-waveguide attenuation and improving sensing performance, the segmented waveguide-enabled pinching antenna (SWAN) system is adopted. Furthermore, an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm for SWAN-based ISAC (SWISAC-AO) is developed, where the optimal structure of the transmit beamforming solution is derived. A graph neural network (GNN), termed SWISAC-GNN, is then proposed to jointly learn PA positions and transmit beamforming, with its alternative update procedure inspired by the SWISAC-AO algorithm. Numerical results show that the GNN achieves sensing performance comparable to or better than the AO algorithm while better satisfying communication requirements.

Recent advances indicate that generative large models pre-trained on massive datasets, can achieve outstanding performance arexhibit exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in large models and enable adaptive transmission over lossy channels, we propose a Large Speech Model enabled Semantic Communication (LargeSC) system. Simultaneously achieving adaptive compression and robust transmission over lossy channels remains challenging, requiring trade-offs among compression efficiency, speech quality, and latency. In this work, we employ the Mimi as a speech codec, converting speech into discrete tokens compatible with existing network architectures. We propose an adaptive controller module that enables adaptive transmission and in-band Unequal Error Protection (UEP), dynamically adjusting to both speech content and packet loss probability under bandwidth constraints. Additionally, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the Moshi foundation model for generative recovery of lost speech tokens. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports bandwidths ranging from 550 bps to 2.06 kbps, outperforms conventional baselines in speech quality under high packet loss rates and achieves an end-to-end latency of approximately 460 ms, thereby demonstrating its potential for real-time deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLargeSC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548cLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728550 bps\u52302.06 kbps\u5e26\u5bbd\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bed\u97f3\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u4e22\u5305\u7387\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eJSCC\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u4e22\u5305\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528Mimi\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8bed\u97f3\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4e22\u5305\u6982\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e0d\u7b49\u9519\u8bef\u4fdd\u62a4\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03Moshi\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6062\u590d\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301550 bps\u52302.06 kbps\u5e26\u5bbd\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4e22\u5305\u7387\u4e0b\u8bed\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6460\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LargeSC\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e22\u5305\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

While RRAM-based AMC has been widely explored for accelerating neural networks, its application to signal processing in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication is rapidly emerging as a promising direction. In this Review, we summarize recent advances in applying AMC to massive MIMO, including DFT/IDFT computation for OFDM modulation and demodulation using MVM circuits; MIMO detection and precoding using MVM-based iterative algorithms; and rapid one-step solutions enabled by matrix inversion (INV) and generalized inverse (GINV) circuits.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a melody-driven SVS framework capable of synthesizing arbitrary lyrics following any reference melody, without relying on phoneme-level alignment. Our method builds on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, enhanced with a dedicated melody extraction module that derives melody representations directly from reference audio. To ensure robust melody encoding, we employ a teacher model to guide the optimization of the melody extractor, alongside an implicit alignment mechanism that enforces similarity distribution constraints for improved melodic stability and coherence. Additionally, we refine duration modeling using weakly annotated song data and introduce a Flow-GRPO reinforcement learning strategy with a multi-objective reward function to jointly enhance pronunciation clarity and melodic fidelity. Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both objective measures and subjective listening tests, especially in zero-shot and lyric adaptation settings, while maintaining high audio quality without manual annotation. This work offers a practical and scalable solution for advancing data-efficient singing voice synthesis.

Within this vision, Semantic-native communication and agentic intelligence are expected to play central roles. SemCom departs from bit-level fidelity and instead emphasizes task-oriented meaning exchange, enabling compact SC and introducing new performance measures such as semantic fidelity and task success rate. Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed. We then present a unified taxonomy that organizes recent research along three axes: i) semantic abstraction level (symbol/feature/intent/knowledge), ii) agent autonomy and coordination granularity (single-, multi-, and hierarchical-agent), and iii) RAN control placement across PHY/MAC, near-real-time RIC, and non-real-time RIC. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically introduce enabling technologies including task-oriented semantic encoders/decoders, multi-agent reinforcement learning, foundation-model-assisted RAN agents, and knowledge-graph-based reasoning for cross-layer awareness. Representative 6G use cases, such as immersive XR, vehicular V2X, and industrial digital twins, are analyzed to illustrate the semantic-agentic convergence in practice. Finally, we identify open challenges in semantic representation standardization, scalable trustworthy agent coordination, O-RAN interoperability, and energy-efficient AI deployment, and outline research directions toward operational semantic-agentic AI-RAN.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f51\u7edc\u878d\u5408\u7684AI-RAN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u539f\u751f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684O-RAN\u65b9\u6848\u4ecd\u4ee5\u6bd4\u7279\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u5b64\u7acb\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff1a1)\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21(\u7b26\u53f7/\u7279\u5f81/\u610f\u56fe/\u77e5\u8bc6)\uff1b2)\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4e0e\u534f\u8c03\u7c92\u5ea6(\u5355/\u591a/\u5206\u5c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53)\uff1b3)RAN\u63a7\u5236\u4f4d\u7f6e(PHY/MAC/\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6RIC/\u975e\u5b9e\u65f6RIC)\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9RAN\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4f7f\u80fd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86XR\u3001V2X\u3001\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7b496G\u7528\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49-\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u878d\u5408\u7684AI-RAN\u9762\u4e34\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u4fe1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u3001O-RAN\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u6548AI\u90e8\u7f72\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49-\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI-RAN\u3002"}}

Experiments on a graded multi-track benchmark show that YingMusic-SVC achieves consistent improvements over strong open-source baselines in timbre similarity, intelligibility, and perceptual naturalness, especially under accompanied and harmony-contaminated conditions, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world SVC deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "YingMusic-SVC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6b4c\u58f0\u8f6c\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6b4c\u66f2\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u548c\u8c10\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u97f3\u9ad8\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b4c\u5531\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6b4c\u58f0\u8f6c\u6362\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6b4c\u66f2\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u548c\u8c10\u5e72\u6270\uff08\u4f34\u594f\u5e72\u6270\u6b4c\u58f0\uff09\u3001\u97f3\u9ad8\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6b4c\u5531\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86SVC\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faYingMusic-SVC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u6b4c\u5531\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684RVC\u97f3\u8272\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u97f3\u8272\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff1b2) F0\u611f\u77e5\u97f3\u8272\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u58f0\u97f3\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b3) \u80fd\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u9ad8\u9891\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548cFlow-GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u7ea7\u591a\u8f68\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cYingMusic-SVC\u5728\u97f3\u8272\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u61c2\u5ea6\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u4f34\u594f\u548c\u548c\u8c10\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cSVC\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "YingMusic-SVC\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6b4c\u58f0\u8f6c\u6362\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For very high-throughput applications, Successive Cancellation (SC) decoding is particularly appealing for polar codes owing to its high area efficiency. In this paper, we propose modifications to SC decoders that employ special nodes to accelerate decoding. Our modifications enable the use of polar IR-HARQ with SC decoding for high throughput applications. Compared to the unmodified SC IR-HARQ scheme, our proposed approach allows us to achieve a 72% reduction in node traversals with a polar code of length 2048. Simulation results confirm that the proposed special node modifications do not cause any degradation in FER performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u6781\u7801SC\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u8282\u70b9\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301IR-HARQ\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301FER\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8282\u70b9\u904d\u5386\u6b21\u6570", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u6781\u7801\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u589e\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u4f20\u8bf7\u6c42\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u6d88\u9664\u89e3\u7801\u56e0\u5176\u9ad8\u9762\u79ef\u6548\u7387\u5bf9\u6781\u7801\u7279\u522b\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b", "method": "\u4fee\u6539SC\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u6b8a\u8282\u70b9\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u6781\u7801IR-HARQ\u80fd\u591f\u4e0eSC\u89e3\u7801\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e94\u7528", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u672a\u4fee\u6539\u7684SC IR-HARQ\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u7801\u957f2048\u7684\u6781\u7801\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8672%\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u904d\u5386\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u7279\u6b8a\u8282\u70b9\u4fee\u6539\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4FER\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u8282\u70b9\u4fee\u6539\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u6781\u7801IR-HARQ\u4e0eSC\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, MOS is a scalar that collapses heterogeneous user expectations, ignores service-level objectives, and is difficult to compare across deployment graphs. We propose a contract-driven QoE auditing framework: each service graph G is evaluated under a set of human-interpretable experience contracts C, yielding a contract-level satisfaction vector Q(G, C). We show that (i) classical MOS regression is a special case with a degenerate contract set, (ii) contract-driven quality is more stable than MOS under graph view transformations (e.g., pooling by system vs. by system type), and (iii) the effective sample complexity of learning contracts is governed by contract semantics rather than merely the dimensionality of C. We instantiate the framework on URGENT2024 MOS (6.9k speech utterances with raw rating vectors) and SingMOS v1 (7,981 singing clips; 80 systems). On URGENT, we train a contract-aware neural auditor on self-supervised WavLM embeddings; on SingMOS, we perform contract-driven graph auditing using released rating vectors and metadata without decoding audio. Empirically, our auditor matches strong MOS predictors in MOS accuracy while providing calibrated contract probabilities; on SingMOS, Q(G, C) exhibits substantially smaller cross-view drift than raw MOS and graph-only baselines; on URGENT, difficulty curves reveal that mis-specified \"simple\" contracts can be harder to learn than richer but better aligned contract sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5951\u7ea6\u7684QoE\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u5951\u7ea6\u5411\u91cf\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfMOS\u6807\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u6b4c\u5531\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u89c2\u5e73\u5747\u610f\u89c1\u5206\u6570(MOS)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u6807\u91cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u671f\u671b\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1b2) \u5ffd\u7565\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u76ee\u6807\uff1b3) \u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5951\u7ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684QoE\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u670d\u52a1\u56feG\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u7ec4\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u5951\u7ea6C\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5951\u7ea6\u7ea7\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u5411\u91cfQ(G,C)\u3002\u5728URGENT2024\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8eWavLM\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5951\u7ea6\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5728SingMOS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u8bc4\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5951\u7ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u56fe\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "1) \u5951\u7ea6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5668\u5728MOS\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u5951\u7ea6\u6982\u7387\uff1b2) \u5728SingMOS\u4e0a\uff0cQ(G,C)\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u6f02\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u5c0f\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbMOS\u548c\u56fe\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b3) \u5728URGENT\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u663e\u793a\u9519\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\"\u7b80\u5355\"\u5951\u7ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u5951\u7ea6\u96c6\u66f4\u96be\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5951\u7ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684QoE\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfMOS\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u671f\u671b\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u90e8\u7f72\u56fe\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u56f0\u96be\u3002"}}

However, most existing studies focus on idealized LoS-dominated environments, overlooking the stochastic nature of realistic wireless propagation. This paper investigates a more practical multiuser pinching-antenna system under a composite probabilistic channel model that captures distance-dependent LoS blockage and NLoS scattering. To account for both efficiency and reliability aspects of communication, two complementary design metrics are considered: an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric characterizing long-term throughput and fairness, and an outage-constrained metric ensuring a prescribed reliability level. Based on these metrics, we formulate two optimization problems: the first maximizes the max-min average SNR across users, while the second maximizes a guaranteed SNR threshold under per-user outage constraints. Although both problems are inherently nonconvex, we exploit their underlying monotonic structures and develop low-complexity, bisection-based algorithms that achieve globally optimal solutions using only simple scalar evaluations. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems significantly outperform conventional fixed-antenna designs even under random LoS and NLoS channels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u7528\u6237pinching\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u5408\u6982\u7387\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747SNR\u548c\u4e2d\u65ad\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709pinching\u5929\u7ebf\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684LoS\u4e3b\u5bfc\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7279\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6982\u7387\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237pinching\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u7684LoS\u963b\u585e\u548cNLoS\u6563\u5c04\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u590d\u5408\u6982\u7387\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\uff1a1) \u8868\u5f81\u957f\u671f\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u5747SNR\u6307\u6807\uff1b2) \u786e\u4fdd\u89c4\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4e2d\u65ad\u7ea6\u675f\u6307\u6807\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7528\u6237\u95f4\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u5e73\u5747SNR\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6bcf\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u65ad\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1SNR\u9608\u503c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8d28\u975e\u51f8\uff0c\u4f46\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5355\u8c03\u7ed3\u6784\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u6807\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u968f\u673aLoS\u548cNLoS\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\uff0cpinching\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u591a\u7528\u6237pinching\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u590d\u5408\u6982\u7387\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce AcuLa (Audio-Clinical Understanding via Language Alignment), a lightweight post-training framework that instills semantic understanding into any audio encoder by aligning it with a medical language model, which acts as a \"semantic teacher.\" To enable alignment at scale, we construct a large-scale dataset by leveraging off-the-shelf large language models to translate the rich, structured metadata accompanying existing audio recordings into coherent clinical reports. Our alignment strategy combines a representation-level contrastive objective with a self-supervised modeling, ensuring that the model learns clinical semantics while preserving fine-grained temporal cues. AcuLa achieves state-of-the-art results across 18 diverse cardio-respiratory tasks from 10 different datasets, improving the mean AUROC on classification benchmarks from 0.68 to 0.79 and, on the most challenging COVID-19 cough detection task, boosting the AUROC from 0.55 to 0.89. Our work demonstrates that this audio-language alignment transforms purely acoustic models into clinically-aware diagnostic tools, establishing a novel paradigm for enhancing physiological understanding in audio-based health monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "AcuLa\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u97f3\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u533b\u5b66\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u80ba\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u64c5\u957f\u68c0\u6d4b\u542c\u8bca\u58f0\u97f3\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f25\u5408\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAcuLa\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u97f3\u9891\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u8868\u793a\u7ea7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5efa\u6a21\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u4e49\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b3) \u5c06\u97f3\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u8bed\u4e49\u6559\u5e08\"\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u768418\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5fc3\u80ba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5e73\u5747AUROC\u4ece0.68\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.79\uff1b\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684COVID-19\u54b3\u55fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cAUROC\u4ece0.55\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.89\u3002", "conclusion": "\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u7eaf\u58f0\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, the high cost of manual annotation and the limited scale of publicly available CSI datasets restrict the performance of supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising avenue, but existing contrastive paradigms rely on data augmentations that conflict with the physical semantics of radio signals and require large-batch training, making them poorly suited for CSI. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CIG-MAE -- a Cross-modal Information-Guided Masked Autoencoder -- that reconstructs both the amplitude and phase of CSI using a symmetric dual-stream architecture with a high masking ratio. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Information-Guided Masking strategy that dynamically allocates attention to time-frequency regions with high information density to improve learning efficiency, and incorporate a Barlow Twins regularizer to align cross-modal representations without negative samples. Experiments on three public datasets show that CIG-MAE consistently outperforms SOTA SSL methods and even surpasses a fully supervised baseline, demonstrating superior data efficiency, robustness, and representation generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "CIG-MAE\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eWiFi CSI\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a9\u7801\u548cBarlow Twins\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "WiFi CSI\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u7269\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8eCSI\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCIG-MAE\uff08\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u9ad8\u63a9\u7801\u7387\u91cd\u5efaCSI\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u65f6\u9891\u533a\u57df\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165Barlow Twins\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCIG-MAE\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8868\u793a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CIG-MAE\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86WiFi CSI\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper considers an ISAC-assisted vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) network, where extended kalman filter-based prediction is combined with real-time optimization to jointly optimize transmit antenna positions and beamforming and power allocation vectors in dynamic environments. We propose two algorithms: a preprocessing-schur complement-projected gradient ascent algorithm for scenarios without sensing quality of service (QoS) constraints, which explores the potential range of sensing performance to provide reference and warm-starting for subsequent constrained optimization; and a heuristic reflective projected dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithm for sensing QoS-constrained scenarios, which achieves substantial performance gains under non-convex constraints with a small number of iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that these approaches enhance both the communication sum-rate and the lower of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound of motion parameter estimation, validating the effectiveness of MA-assisted beamforming in dynamic V2I ISAC networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u8f85\u52a9\u7684V2I ISAC\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b2c\u516d\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\uff08MA\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001V2I\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u65e0\u611f\u77e5QoS\u7ea6\u675f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406-Schur\u8865-\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u6f5c\u529b\u8303\u56f4\uff1b2) \u611f\u77e5QoS\u7ea6\u675f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53cd\u5c04\u6295\u5f71\u52a8\u6001\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4ee5\u5c11\u91cf\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u603b\u901f\u7387\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u514b\u62c9\u7f8e\u7f57\u4e0b\u754c\u4e0b\u9650\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MA\u8f85\u52a9\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5728\u52a8\u6001V2I ISAC\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u989d\u5916\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001V2I ISAC\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u516d\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684ISAC\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, its known analytical intractability presents persistent channel characterization and performance analysis challenges. This paper introduces two effective and mathematically tractable surrogate models for the Lognormal distribution, constructed from the product of Nakagami-$m$ and Inverse Nakagami-$m$ (I-Nakagami-$m$) variates. These models yield asymptotically exact closed-form expressions for key performance metrics -- including the characteristic function, bit error rate, and Shannon's capacity -- and enable analytically tractable expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the composite $\u03b1$-$\u03bc$-Lognormal fading model. To facilitate implementation, a moment-matching framework is developed to map the Lognormal parameters to the surrogate model parameters. In addition, a random mixture approach is proposed to enhance convergence by exploiting the complementary approximation properties of the Nakagami-$m$ and I-Nakagami-$m$ distributions. The methodology is further extended to heterogeneous cascaded fading channels comprising arbitrary combinations of $\u03b1$-$\u03bc$, $\u03ba$-$\u03bc$, and $\u03b7$-$\u03bc$ variates, for which moment-based mappings to the equivalent Lognormal distributions are derived.

This optimization typically assumes prior knowledge of the target direction, which is unavailable before the target is detected. To enhance direction estimation, it is critical to develop array pattern synthesis techniques that yield a wider beam by maximizing the received power over the entire target area. Although this challenge has been addressed with active antennas, RIS systems pose a unique challenge due to their inherent phase constraints, which can be continuous or discrete.\n  This work addresses this challenge through a novel array pattern synthesis method tailored for discrete phase constraints in RIS. We introduce a penalty method that pushes these constraints to the boundary of the convex hull. Then, the Minorization-Maximization (MM) method is utilized to reformulate the problem into a convex one. Our numerical results show that our algorithm can generate a wide beam pattern comparable to that achievable with per-power constraints, with both the amplitudes and phases being adjustable. We compare our method with a traditional beam sweeping technique, showing a) several orders of magnitude reduction of the MSE of Angle of Arrival (AOA) at low to medium Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)s; and b) $8$~dB SNR reduction to achieve a high probability of detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9RIS\u79bb\u6563\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9635\u5217\u6a21\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u548cMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5bbd\u6ce2\u675f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RIS\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5047\u8bbe\u5df2\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u5c04\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u524d\u65b9\u5411\u672a\u77e5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5bbd\u6ce2\u675f\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6574\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u800cRIS\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ea6\u675f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9RIS\u79bb\u6563\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9635\u5217\u6a21\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5f15\u5165\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u5411\u51f8\u5305\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528Minorization-Maximization(MM)\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "1) \u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5e45\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f4d\u5747\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u529f\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5bbd\u6ce2\u675f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce2\u675f\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u4e2dSNR\u4e0bAOA\u4f30\u8ba1MSE\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b3) \u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u6240\u9700\u7684SNR\u964d\u4f4e8dB\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RIS\u79bb\u6563\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5bbd\u6ce2\u675f\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aRIS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u672a\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Deep learning (DL)-based methods have gained wide attention due to their excellent performance, but research mainly focuses on single-input single-output (SISO) systems, with limited exploration for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The confounding effects of multi-antenna channels can interfere with the statistical properties of MIMO signals, making identification particularly challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Channel-Aware Multi-Domain feature extraction (CAMD) framework for AMR in MIMO systems. Our CAMD framework reconstructs the transmitted signal through an efficient channel compensation module and achieves a more robust representation capability against channel interference by extracting and integrating multi-domain features, including intra-antenna temporal correlations and inter-antenna channel correlations. We have verified our method on the widely-used dataset, MIMOSig-Ref, with complex mobile channel environments. Extensive experiments confirm the performance advantages of CAMD over previous state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCAMF\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u9053\u8865\u507f\u548c\u591a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8SISO\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u3002\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u5e72\u6270MIMO\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bc6\u522b\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u9053\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff08CAMD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u6548\u4fe1\u9053\u8865\u507f\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u5efa\u53d1\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5929\u7ebf\u5185\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5929\u7ebf\u95f4\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff09\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u79fb\u52a8\u4fe1\u9053\u73af\u5883\u7684MIMOSig-Ref\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9eCAMD\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "CAMD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u9053\u8865\u507f\u548c\u591a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

PwMS performed the U-Turn Test (UTT), a smartphone-based assessment of dynamic balance, in a gait laboratory (supervised setting) using 6 smartphones at different body locations and daily during a 2-week remote period (unsupervised setting) using 1 smartphone. In the supervised setting, the accuracy of detecting turns with smartphones was compared against turns detected with a motion capture system (mocap) using F1 scores. Agreement between turn speed measured with smartphones and mocap was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC[3,1]) and bias. In the unsupervised setting, test-retest reliability was assessed by ICC(2,1), and correlations with clinical and patient-reported measures by Spearman rank correlation. Ninety-six PwMS were included. In the supervised setting, turns were detected with high accuracy (F1 scores >95% across smartphone wear locations). Smartphone-derived turn speed was comparable across the supervised (1.44 rad/s) and unsupervised settings (1.47 rad/s), and with mocap-derived turn speed (1.47 rad/s). ICC(3,1) revealed high agreement between smartphone- and mocap-derived turn speed (ICC[3,1]: 0.87-0.92 across smartphone wear locations). Bias was minimal (-0.04 to 0.11 rad/s). In the unsupervised setting, test-retest reliability (ICC[2,1]) was >0.90 when aggregating >=2 tests. The UTT correlated with Timed 25-Foot Walk gait speed, EDSS, Ambulation score, 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, and Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (r=-0.79 to -0.61). The UTT measures turn speed accurately and reproducibly irrespective of smartphone wear location and settings. These findings affirm its potential as a valuable tool in multiple sclerosis trials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673aU-Turn\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u591a\u53d1\u6027\u786c\u5316\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8f6c\u8eab\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f69\u6234\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u53d1\u6027\u786c\u5316\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7eb3\u516596\u540d\u591a\u53d1\u6027\u786c\u5316\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f7f\u75286\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8eab\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884cU-Turn\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u5728\u975e\u76d1\u7763\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c2\u5468\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d4b\u8bd5-\u91cd\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027", "result": "\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u8eab\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff08F1\u5206\u6570>95%\uff09\uff1b\u8f6c\u8eab\u901f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08ICC: 0.87-0.92\uff09\uff1b\u975e\u76d1\u7763\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5-\u91cd\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9ad8\uff08ICC>0.90\uff09\uff1b\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u6307\u6807\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173", "conclusion": "U-Turn\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u8f6c\u8eab\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0d\u53d7\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4f69\u6234\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u662f\u591a\u53d1\u6027\u786c\u5316\u75c7\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177"}}

Extending a well-known distributed optimization strategy called diffusion adaptation to Riemannian manifolds, we show that the resulting algorithm, the Riemannian diffusion adaptation, provably exhibits several desirable behaviors when minimizing a sum of geodesically smooth non-convex functions over manifolds of bounded curvature. More specifically, we establish that the algorithm can approximately achieve network agreement in the sense that Fr\u00e9chet variance of the iterates among the agents is small. Moreover, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a first-order stationary point for general geodesically non-convex cost functions. When the global cost function additionally satisfies the Riemannian Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition, we also show that it converges linearly under a constant step size up to a steady-state error. Finally, we apply this algorithm to a decentralized robust principal component analysis (PCA) problem formulated on the Grassmann manifold and illustrate its convergence and performance through numerical simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u9ece\u66fc\u6269\u6563\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5e73\u6ed1\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u975e\u51f8\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e00\u9636\u9a7b\u70b9\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eGrassmann\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u9c81\u68d2PCA\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5e73\u6ed1\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u975e\u51f8\u7684\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8457\u540d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u6269\u6563\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ece\u66fc\u6269\u6563\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5e73\u6ed1\u975e\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u548c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f51\u7edc\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684Fr\u00e9chet\u65b9\u5dee\u5c0f\uff09\uff1b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e00\u9636\u9a7b\u70b9\uff1b\u5f53\u5168\u5c40\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ece\u66fcPolyak-Lojasiewicz\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u6052\u5b9a\u6b65\u957f\u4e0b\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7a33\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u5728Grassmann\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u9c81\u68d2PCA\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ece\u66fc\u6269\u6563\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5e73\u6ed1\u4f46\u975e\u51f8\u7684\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5982\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u9c81\u68d2PCA\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper breaks that compromise. We present a simulator that achieves both fidelity and speed by focusing on the critical, yet overlooked, component of simulation: the photon count statistics. Our key contribution is a Markov-renewal process (MRP) formulation that, for the first time, analytically predicts the mean and variance of registered photon counts under dead time. To make this MRP model computationally tractable, we introduce a spectral truncation rule that efficiently computes the complex covariance statistics. By proving the shift-invariance of the process, we extend this per-pixel model to full histogram cube generation via a precomputed lookup table. Our method generates 3D cubes indistinguishable from the sequential gold-standard, yet is orders of magnitude faster. This finally enables large-scale, physically-faithful data generation for learning-based SP-LiDAR reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u7a0b(MRP)\u7684\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u96be\u9009\u62e9\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cca\u677e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u4f46\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u987a\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53c8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u7a0b(MRP)\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u89e3\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u6b7b\u533a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u5747\u503c\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u8c31\u622a\u65ad\u89c4\u5219\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7edf\u8ba1\uff1b3) \u8bc1\u660e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u5c06\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5b8c\u6574\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u76843D\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u5149\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u901f\u5ea6-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

At the center-stage, while waveguide based pinching antennas have been shown to beneficially ameliorate wireless propagation environments, their applications have remained confined to high-frequency scenarios. As a remedy, we propose a downlink generalized pinching-antenna system that adapts this compelling concept to low-frequency operation through a leaky-coaxial-cable (LCX) implementation. By endowing LCX structures with controllable radiation slots, the system inherits the key capabilities of waveguide based pinching antennas. Explicitly, these include reconfigurable line-of-sight (LoS) links, reduced path loss, and flexible deployment, while supporting a practical implementation of the pinching-antenna concept at low frequencies. A twin-stage propagation model is developed for characterizing both the guided transmission and wireless radiation encountered over LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths. Analytical results reveal strong local gain, complemented by rapid distance-dependent decay. Hence, we conceive a matching joint optimization framework, which maximizes throughput by harnessing game-theoretic association and convex power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate substantial performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f0f\u6cc4\u540c\u8f74\u7535\u7f06\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u8f90\u5c04\u69fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u4e3b\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9891\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff08\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u89c6\u8ddd\u94fe\u8def\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u90e8\u7f72\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4f4e\u9891\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6f0f\u6cc4\u540c\u8f74\u7535\u7f06\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88\u53ef\u63a7\u8f90\u5c04\u69fd\u4ee5\u7ee7\u627f\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5173\u8054\u548c\u51f8\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u6982\u5ff5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4f4e\u9891\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f0f\u6cc4\u540c\u8f74\u7535\u7f06\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a6G\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recently, it is established by Mahdavifar, Rajam\u00e4ki, and Pal that array geometry of sparse arrays has fundamental connections with the design of subspace codes in coding theory. This was then utilized to design efficient \\textit{sensing subspace codes} that estimate the DoA with good resolution. Specifically, the Bose-Chowla sensing subspace code provides near optimal code design for unique DoA estimation with tight theoretical upper bound on the error performance. However, the currently known decoder for these codes, to estimate the DoA, is a traditional \\textit{Maximum-a-Posterior (MAP) decoder} with complexity that is cubic with the number of antennas. In this work, we propose novel efficient decoding algorithms for sensing subspace codes, that reduce the complexity down to quadratic while providing new knobs to tune in order to tradeoff complexity with error performance. The decoders are further evaluated for their performance via Monte Carlo simulations for a range of SNRs demonstrating promising performance that smoothly approaches the MAP performance as the complexity grows from quadratic to cubic in the number of antennas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u611f\u77e5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7801\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u7acb\u65b9\u964d\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\uff0c\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8c03\u6298\u8877", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u611f\u77e5\u57286G JCAS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709Bose-Chowla\u611f\u77e5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7801\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f18DOA\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5176MAP\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u7acb\u65b9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u7acb\u65b9\u964d\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65b0\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540cSNR\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5f53\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u589e\u957f\u5230\u7acb\u65b9\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u6ed1\u63a5\u8fd1MAP\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7801\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a6G JCAS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684DOA\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6298\u8877"}}

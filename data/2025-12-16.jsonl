Akan"], "title": "Modeling and Analysis of VOC-based Interplant Molecular Communication Channel", "comment": "11 pages, 14 figures", "summary": "Molecular communication (MC) enables information transfer using particles inspired by biological systems. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are one of the most abundant and diverse classes of signaling molecules used by living or non-living objects. VOC-based MC holds great promise in developing long-range, bio-compatible communication systems capable of interfacing nano- and micro-scale devices. In this paper, we present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for VOC-based interplant MC from an ICT perspective. The communication process is divided into three stages: transmission (VOC biosynthesis and emission from leaves), channel propagation (advection-diffusion in turbulent wind via Gaussian puff for stress-induced VOC release and Gaussian plume for constitutive VOC release), and reception (VOC uptake and physiological response in the receiver plant). Each stage is analyzed by its attenuation and delay. Numerical results demonstrate that VOC-based channels exhibit low-pass behavior, with bandwidth and capacity heavily influenced by distance, wind velocity, and noise. Though the physical channel supports moderate frequencies, biological constraints at the transmitter restrict the end-to-end channel to slow-varying signals."}

However, existing literature addresses these impairments in isolation, since their multiplicative coupling in the received signal severely limits conventional estimators and prevents simultaneous recovery. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-aperture FSO receiver architecture that leverages spatial diversity across a lens array to decouple these intertwined effects. Building on this hardware design, we propose a hierarchical deep learning framework that sequentially estimates AoA, transmitter pointing error, and turbulence coefficients. This decomposition significantly reduces learning complexity and enables robust inference even under strong atmospheric fading. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-MAP accuracy with orders-of-magnitude lower computational cost, and substantially outperforms end-to-end learning baselines in terms of estimation accuracy and generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate practical joint estimation of these three key parameters, paving the way for reliable, turbulence-resilient multi-aperture FSO systems."}

SDP defines how heterogeneous wireless signals are mapped into a unified perception data-block schema through lightweight synchronization, frequency-time alignment, and resampling, while a Canonical Polyadic-Alternating Least Squares (CP-ALS) pooling stage provides a task-agnostic representation that preserves multipath, spectral, and temporal structures. Built upon this protocol, a unified benchmark is established for detection, recognition, and vital-sign estimation with consistent preprocessing, training, and evaluation. Experiments under the cross-user split demonstrate that SDP significantly reduces variance (approximately 88%) across seeds while maintaining competitive accuracy and latency, confirming its value as a reproducible foundation for multi-modal and multitask sensing research."}

This paper presents a learning-driven dual-line laser scanning framework for fast and precise satellite positioning. Unlike conventional Gaussian-beam acquisition systems that rely on multiple sequential beams or mechanical steering, the proposed approach employs two orthogonal line-shaped laser beams to perform structured optical scanning over the ambiguity region without any moving parts. A physics-based model incorporating atmospheric attenuation, turbulence, and MRR-based reflection is developed, and a data-driven neural estimator is trained to map received optical energy patterns to the satellite's two-dimensional position. Simulation results demonstrate that the learning-driven method achieves near-MAP accuracy with typical errors of 7-10 m and deterministic scanning time of 1-2 ms, while conventional two-stage Gaussian-beam schemes exhibit comparable errors but random sensing durations of up to 5 ms. The proposed framework therefore offers a favorable trade-off between positioning accuracy, computational complexity, and sensing latency, making it a practical candidate for next-generation optical LEO tracking systems."}

Two orthogonal line lasers perform synchronized longitudinal and transverse scanning to provide continuous, wide-area coverage across the roadway.

After each local training round, the server refines the global model on the reserve set with either clean or additional adversarially perturbed data, thereby counteracting non-IID drift and mitigating potential model poisoning without adding substantial client-side cost or altering the aggregation process. We theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of our framework, showing faster convergence and a reduced steady-state error relative to baseline federated averaging.

To address this limitation, we propose a new rotatable antenna array (RAA) architecture in this paper, which enables three-dimensional (3D) rotational control of an antenna array to provide enhanced spatial flexibility for null steering. To characterize its performance, we aim to jointly optimize the 3D rotational angles of the RAA, to maximize the beam gain over a given desired direction, while nulling those over multiple interference directions under zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming. However, this problem is non-convex and challenging to tackle due to the highly nonlinear expression of the beam gain in terms of the rotational angles. To gain insights, we first examine several special cases including both isotropic and directional antenna radiation patterns, deriving the conditions under which full beam gain can be achieved over the desired direction while meeting the nulling constraints for interference directions. These conditions clearly indicate that compared with FOA arrays, RAAs can significantly relax the angular separation requirement for achieving effective null steering. For other general cases, we propose a sequential update algorithm, that iteratively refines the 3D rotational angles by discretizing the 3D angular search space. To avoid undesired local optimum, a Gibbs sampling (GS) procedure is also employed between two consecutive rounds of sequential update for solution exploration. Simulation results verify our analytical results and show superior null-steering performance of RAAs to FOA arrays."}

However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependence, and privacy concerns, and edge-based solutions, which provide low latency and improved privacy but are limited by computational constraints. This paper presents ASTA, an adaptive speech-to-action solution that dynamically routes voice commands between edge and cloud inference to balance performance and system resource utilization. ASTA integrates on-device automatic speech recognition and lightweight offline language-model inference with cloud-based LLM processing, guided by real-time system metrics such as CPU workload, device temperature, and network latency. A metric-aware routing mechanism selects the inference path at runtime, while a rule-based command validation and repair component ensures successful end-to-end command execution. We implemented our solution on an NVIDIA Jetson-based edge platform and evaluated it using a diverse dataset of 80 spoken commands. Experimental results show that ASTA successfully routes all input commands for execution, achieving a balanced distribution between online and offline inference. The system attains an ASR accuracy of 62.5% and generates executable commands without repair for only 47.5% of inputs, highlighting the importance of the repair mechanism in improving robustness. These results suggest that adaptive edge-cloud orchestration is a viable approach for resilient and resource-aware voice-controlled IoT systems."}

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising solution for 6G networks due to its energy efficiency (EE) and low cost, while cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) was proposed as an innovative network architecture without fixed cell boundaries to enhance these measures even further. However, existing studies often assume consistently high traffic loads, neglecting the dynamic nature of user demand. This can result in underutilized access points (APs) and unnecessary energy expenditure during low-demand periods. To tackle the challenge of EE in CF-mMIMO systems during low load periods, this paper proposes a novel energy-efficient transmission scheme that jointly coordinates active APs and multiple passive RISs. Specifically, a dynamic AP sleep-mode strategy is designed, where certain APs are selectively deactivated while nearby RISs assist in maintaining coverage. We formulate the EE maximization objective as a fractional programming problem and adopt the Dinkelbach method in conjunction with alternating optimization (AO) to iteratively solve the three coupled subproblems: (i) AP selection via a hybrid branch-and-bound (BnB) and greedy algorithm, (ii) transmit power optimization using a sequential convex approximation (SCA) method, initialized by a heuristic zero-forcing strategy, and (iii) RIS phase shift optimization using gradient projection. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significantly higher EE than existing methods in both low and moderate user scenarios."}

To address this gap, we introduce HQ-MPSD, a high-quality multilingual partial deepfake speech dataset. HQ-MPSD is constructed using linguistically coherent splice points derived from fine-grained forced alignment, preserving prosodic and semantic continuity and minimizing audible and visual boundary artifacts. The dataset contains 350.8 hours of speech across eight languages and 550 speakers, with background effects added to better reflect real-world acoustic conditions. MOS evaluations and spectrogram analysis confirm the high perceptual naturalness of the samples. We benchmark state-of-the-art detection models through cross-language and cross-dataset evaluations, and all models experience performance drops exceeding 80% on HQ-MPSD.

However, the limited wafer area necessitates trade-offs among compute, memory, and communication resources. Fully harnessing the potential of wafer-scale integration while mitigating its architectural constraints is essential for maximizing LLM training performance.

To tackle this challenge, we propose DisCo-Speech, a zero-shot controllable TTS framework that enables prosody control and voice cloning via a disentangled speech codec (DisCodec) and an LM-based generator. The core component, DisCodec, contains two core stages: 1) Tri-factor disentanglement, which explicitly factorizes speech into content, prosody, and timbre subspaces via parallel encoders and hybrid losses; and 2) Fusion and reconstruction, which fuses content and prosody into unified content-prosody tokens suitable for LM prediction, while jointly optimizing reconstruction quality to resolve the disentanglement-reconstruction trade-off. With this design, the LM performs prosodic continuation from a style prompt while the decoder handles target timbre injection, enabling flexible zero-shot control. Experiments show that DisCo-Speech matches state-of-the-art voice cloning performance while outperforming baselines in zero-shot prosody control. By resolving the core entanglement at the codec level, DisCo-Speech provides a robust foundation for controllable speech synthesis.

To answer these questions, we conduct an empirical study on two representative tasks: CSI compression and temporal channel prediction. Models are trained and evaluated using in-domain, cross-domain, and small-data fine-tuning protocols. Across settings, we observe that stochastic-only evaluation may over- or under-estimate performance relative to RT. These findings support a task-aware recipe where stochastic models can be leveraged for scalable pre-training and for tasks that do not rely on strong spatiotemporal coupling. When that coupling matters, pre-training and evaluation should be grounded in spatially consistent or geometrically similar RT scenarios.

However, power consumption remains a significant concern due to the enlarged system dimension, underscoring the need for thorough investigations into efficient system design and deployment. To this end, an in-depth study is conducted on mid-band XL-MIMO systems. Specifically, a comprehensive power consumption model is proposed, encompassing the power consumption of major hardware components and signal processing procedures, while capturing the influence of key system parameters. Considering typical near-field propagation characteristics, closed-form approximations of throughput are derived, providing an analytical framework for assessing energy efficiency (EE). Based on the proposed framework, the scaling law of EE with respect to key system configurations is derived, offering valuable insights for system design. Subsequently, extensions and comparisons are conducted among representative multi-antenna technologies, demonstrating the superiority of mid-band XL-MIMO in EE. Extensive numerical results not only verify the tightness of the throughput analysis but also validate the EE evaluations, unveiling the potential of energy-efficient mid-band XL-MIMO systems."}

Full-duplex multi-tag AmBC systems provide the scalability and efficient spectrum utilization essential for next generation Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. However, the presence of multiple tags, self-interference and hardware impairments such as inphase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance, makes accurate channel estimation indispensable for efficient interference management. The large number of channel parameters and the presence of mirror images of each signal component necessitate careful design of the channel estimation phase to prevent performance degradation. In this work, we propose a novel three-stage training protocol and pilot-based estimation scheme that ensure signal orthogonality and successfully avoid error floors. We also propose two semi-blind estimators, one based on decision-directed (DD) criterion and the other on the expectation conditional maximization (ECM) framework. By exploiting both pilots and data symbols, these two estimators achieve higher estimation accuracy than pilot-based estimation, at the cost of additional complexity. Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for both types of estimation are also derived. The pilot-based estimator and the ECM estimator approach their respective CRBs, while the DD estimator performs mid-way between them. The three proposed solutions support different use cases by offering distinct tradeoffs between performance and computational complexity."}

Unlike conventional modulation schemes that operate in the time-frequency (TF) domain, OTFS projects signals to the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where wireless channels exhibit sparse and quasi-static characteristics. This fundamental transformation enables superior channel estimation (CE) performance in challenging propagation environments characterized by high-mobility, severe multipath effects, and rapidly time-varying channel conditions. This article provides a systematic examination of CE techniques for OTFS systems, covering the extensive research landscape from foundational methods to cutting-edge approaches. We present a detailed analysis of DD and TF domain CE techniques presented in the literature, including separate pilot, embedded pilot, and superimposed pilot approaches. The article encompasses various algorithmic frameworks including Bayesian learning, matching pursuit-based techniques, message passing algorithms, deep learning (DL)-based methods, and recent CE approaches. Additionally, we explore joint CE and signal detection (SD) strategies, the integration of OTFS with next-generation wireless systems including massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Critical implementation challenges are presented, including leakage suppression, inter-Doppler interference mitigation, impulsive noise handling, signaling overhead reduction, guard space requirements, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) management, beam squint effects, and hardware impairments."}

A channel state information (CSI) based precoder is designed at the access point (AP) to suppress MU interference, enabling interference free reception for the legitimate users. To further enhance secrecy performance, we formulate a joint optimization problem that maximizes the secrecy sum rate using an alternating optimization (AO) framework, which iteratively updates the active beamforming at the AP, user power allocation, and the RIS phase shift matrix. The highly nonconvex problem is addressed under the Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) framework and solved using a Riemannian Conjugate Gradient (RCG) algorithm for RIS phase shift design. Simulation results verify that the proposed framework effectively enhances the secrecy sum rate and eliminates interference, demonstrating its potential for secure and scalable CFmMIMO networks in dense wireless environments."}

Specifically, we describe structural connectivity through the lens of the 1-dimensional Hodge Laplacian, processing signals defined on edges to capture co-fluctuation information between brain regions. We demonstrate that edge-based approaches achieve superior task decoding accuracy in static and dynamic scenarios compared to conventional node-based techniques, thereby unveiling unique aspects of brain functional organization.

The system integrates three key stages: an SPS classifier module, a SIR predictor, and a bank of specialized U-Net autoencoders designed for different interference conditions. The classification block identifies the parameters required for cancellation. The recommender then directs the signal to the appropriate mitigation model, optionally incorporating SIR-based decisions for scenarios where successive interference cancellation may be advantageous. Experiments conducted across diverse SIR levels and modulation environments show that the recommender strategy improves robustness and reduces BER compared to using any single mitigation method alone. The results demonstrate the potential of adaptive, model-selective architectures to enhance interference resilience in dynamic communication environments."}

A simple version of this problem is the detection of a signal of interest with unknown parameters in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). When the parameters defining the signal are not known, an optimal detector (in the Neyman-Pearson sense) does not exist. An upper bound on the performance of any detector is the matched filter, which implies perfect sample by sample knowledge of the signal of interest. In recent years Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proven to be very effective at hypothesis testing problems such as object detection and image classification. This paper examines the application of DNN-based approaches to the signal detection problem at the raw I/Q level and compares them to statistically based approaches as well as the Matched Filter. These methods aim to maximize the Probability of Detection Pd while maintaining a constant Probability of False Alarm PF A. Two Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are trained and assessed on this signal detection problem, across three signal of interest models. A model was also trained on a unified dataset and assessed across all signals of interest."}

Multi-bit modulators allow balancing complexity and speed by reducing the clock frequency and increasing the number of levels in the quantizer.

This paper establishes theoretical performance limits for MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems under per-element constant-envelope (CE) transmission constraints. We demonstrate that hardware distortions -- specifically power amplifier nonlinearity, ADC quantization, and oscillator phase noise -- impose a capacity ceiling that cannot be overcome by increasing transmit power. A unified link budget framework integrates wideband beam squint, aperture pointing errors, and colored noise sources through a spectral consistency principle that ensures residual phase noise is counted exactly once across communication and sensing analyses. The sensing bounds are derived via the Whittle-Fisher Information Matrix under a Constant Acceleration kinematic model with jerk noise, yielding closed-form scaling laws: residual phase noise variance scales as $α^{-1}$ while dynamic state-estimation error (DSE) variance scales as $α^{-5}$ with pilot overhead $α$. Numerical results show divergent MIMO scaling: sensing precision improves with array size ($\\mathrm{RMSE} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{N_t N_r}$), while the critical SNR exhibits scale invariance regarding array size, implying that the distortion-limited transition point stabilizes regardless of the array scale. The steep $α^{-5}$ DSE scaling creates an operationally infeasible region at $α< α^* \\approx 0.16$, where $α^* = (C_{\\mathrm{DSE}}/C_{\\mathrm{PN}})^{1/4}$ -- a constraint-driven threshold under the adopted baseline for LEO operation. These findings provide design guidelines for hardware-efficient THz-ISL constellations."}

COVID19 was announced as an epidemic by World Health Organization soon after. Some of the symptoms of this disease are fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing. In more severe cases, death may occur as a result of infection. The most significant question in fighting the pandemic and controlling the epidemic is the early diagnosis of COVID19(+) patients and the follow-up of these patients. Therefore, various diagnostic mechanisms are used. Additionally to the RT-PCR test, medical imaging methods have been utilized, especially in the detection of COVID19(+) patients. In this study, an alternative approach was proposed by using cough data, which is one of the most prominent symptoms of COVID19(+) patients. The cough acoustic public dataset on the Virufy website was used. The entire data was normalized using z-normalization technique. The performance of the features obtained via the 5-layer empirical mode decomposition method and the performances of different classifiers has been compared. As the classifier algorithm, 5 different algorithms were used. The highest accuracy and F1-score performances were obtained by using Ensemble-Bagged-Trees algorithm as 90.6% and 90.5%, respectively. On the other hand, other classification algorithms used in the study are Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and k-Nearest Neigbors, respectively. According to the results obtained, choosing the right classifier algorithm provides high results. Thus, it is clear that using cough acoustic data, those with COVID19(+) can be detected easily and effectively."}

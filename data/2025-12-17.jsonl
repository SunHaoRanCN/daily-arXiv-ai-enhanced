However, performance in realistic capture conditions - background noise (domestic/office/transport), room reverberation, and consumer channels - often lags clean-lab results. We survey and evaluate robustness for state-of-the-art audio deepfake detection models and present a reproducible framework that mixes MS-SNSD noises with ASVspoof 2021 DF utterances to evaluate under controlled signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). SNR is a measured proxy for noise severity used widely in speech; it lets us sweep from near-clean (35 dB) to very noisy (-5 dB) to quantify graceful degradation. We study multi-condition training and fixed-SNR testing for pretrained encoders (WavLM, Wav2Vec2, MMS), reporting accuracy, ROC-AUC, and EER on binary and four-class (authenticity x corruption) tasks. In our experiments, finetuning reduces EER by 10-15 percentage points at 10-0 dB SNR across backbones."}

The student backbone uses stacked depthwise-separable \"expand-depthwise-project\" blocks with global response normalization to stabilize training and improve robustness to device and noise variability, while a global pooling head yields class logits for efficient edge inference. To inject richer inductive bias, we assemble a diverse set of teacher models and learn two complementary fusion heads: z1, which predicts per-teacher mixture weights using a student-style backbone, and z2, a lightweight MLP that performs per-class logit fusion. The student is distilled from the ensemble via temperature-scaled soft targets combined with hard labels, enabling it to approximate the ensemble's decision geometry with a single compact model.

This work presents two primary contributions to address these issues. Memo2496, a large-scale dataset, offers 2496 instrumental music tracks with continuous valence arousal labels, annotated by 30 certified music specialists. Annotation quality is ensured through calibration with extreme emotion exemplars and a consistency threshold of 0.25, measured by Euclidean distance in the valence arousal space. Furthermore, the Dual-view Adaptive Music Emotion Recogniser (DAMER) is introduced. DAMER integrates three synergistic modules: Dual Stream Attention Fusion (DSAF) facilitates token-level bidirectional interaction between Mel spectrograms and cochleagrams via cross attention mechanisms; Progressive Confidence Labelling (PCL) generates reliable pseudo labels employing curriculum-based temperature scheduling and consistency quantification using Jensen Shannon divergence; and Style Anchored Memory Learning (SAML) maintains a contrastive memory queue to mitigate cross-track feature drift. Extensive experiments on the Memo2496, 1000songs, and PMEmo datasets demonstrate DAMER's state-of-the-art performance, improving arousal dimension accuracy by 3.43%, 2.25%, and 0.17%, respectively.

This dissertation posits that a systematic, hierarchical approach is essential to overcome these challenges, achieving the robust scalability at the representation, architecture, and system levels. At the representation level, we investigate methods for building a unified model that learns audio-visual features inherently robust to diverse real-world corruptions, thereby enabling generalization to new environments without specialized modules. To address architectural scalability, we explore how to efficiently expand model capacity while ensuring the adaptive and reliable use of multimodal inputs, developing a framework that intelligently allocates computational resources based on the input characteristics. Finally, at the system level, we present methods to expand the system's functionality through modular integration with large-scale foundation models, leveraging their powerful cognitive and generative capabilities to maximize final recognition accuracy.

Monaural artifacts from ODAQ were adapted in combinations with left-right (LR) and mid-side (MS) stereo processing, across stimuli including solo instruments, typical wide stereo mixes and and hard-panned mixes. Listening tests in different presentation context -- with and without direct comparison of MS and LR conditions -- were conducted to collect subjective data beyond monaural artifacts while also scrutinizing the listening test methodology. The ODAQ dataset is extended with new material along with subjective scores from 16 expert listeners. The listening test results show substantial influences of the stimuli's spatial characteristics as well as the presentation context. Notably, several significant disparities between LR and MS only occur when presented in direct comparison. The findings suggest that listeners primarily assess timbral impairments when spatial characteristics are consistent and focus on stereo image only when timbral quality is similar. The rating of an additional mono anchor was overall consistent across different stereo characteristics, averaging at 65 on the MUSHRA scale, further corroborating that listeners prioritize timbral over spatial impressions."}

Identification # TCAS-I-03260-2025", "summary": "This paper presents a pipeline stage resolved timing characterization of a 32-bit RISC V processor implemented on a 20 nm FPGA and a 7 nm FinFET ASIC platform. A unified analysis framework is introduced that decomposes timing paths into logic, routing, and clocking components and maps them to well-defined pipeline stage transitions. This approach enables systematic comparison of timing behavior across heterogeneous implementation technologies at a microarchitectural level. Using static timing analysis and statistical characterization, the study shows that although both implementations exhibit dominant critical paths in the EX to MEM pipeline transition, their underlying timing mechanisms differ fundamentally. FPGA timing is dominated by routing parasitics and placement dependent variability, resulting in wide slack distributions and sensitivity to routing topology. In contrast, ASIC timing is governed primarily by combinational logic depth and predictable parametric variation across process, voltage, and temperature corners, yielding narrow and stable timing distributions. The results provide quantitative insight into the structural origins of timing divergence between programmable and custom fabrics and demonstrate the effectiveness of pipeline stage resolved analysis for identifying platform specific bottlenecks. Based on these findings, the paper derives design implications for achieving predictable timing closure in processor architectures targeting both FPGA and ASIC implementations."}

Due to the limited availability of richly annotated music datasets, much of the progress in AMT has been concentrated on classical piano music, and even a few very specific datasets. Whether these systems can generalize effectively to other musical contexts remains an open question. Complementing recent studies on distribution shifts in sound (e.g., recording conditions), in this work we investigate the musical dimension -- specifically, variations in genre, dynamics, and polyphony levels. To this end, we introduce the MDS corpus, comprising three distinct subsets -- (1) Genre, (2) Random, and (3) MAEtest -- to emulate different axes of distribution shift. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art AMT systems on the MDS corpus using both traditional information-retrieval and musically-informed performance metrics. Our extensive evaluation isolates and exposes varying degrees of performance degradation under specific distribution shifts. In particular, we measure a note-level F1 performance drop of 20 percentage points due to sound, and 14 due to genre. Generally, we find that dynamics estimation proves more vulnerable to musical variation than onset prediction. Musically informed evaluation metrics, particularly those capturing harmonic structure, help identify potential contributing factors. Furthermore, experiments with randomly generated, non-musical sequences reveal clear limitations in system performance under extreme musical distribution shifts. Altogether, these findings offer new evidence of the persistent impact of the Corpus Bias problem in deep AMT systems."}

AED models trained on segmented utterances learn to encode absolute frame positions by exploiting limited acoustic context beyond segment boundaries, but fail to generalize when decoding long-form segments where these cues vanish. The model loses ability to order acoustic encodings due to permutation invariance of keys and values in cross-attention. We propose four modifications: (1) injecting explicit absolute positional encodings into cross-attention for each decoded segment, (2) long-form training with extended acoustic context to eliminate implicit absolute position encoding, (3) segment concatenation to cover diverse segmentations needed during training, and (4) semantic segmentation to align AED-decoded segments with training segments. We show these modifications close the accuracy gap between continuous and segmented acoustic encodings, enabling auto-regressive use of the attention decoder."}

To address this gap, we introduce the first MCP evaluation benchmark, MuseCPBench, which covers four categories of musical facets and enables comprehensive comparisons across five representative music editing baselines.

First, we introduce differentiable data augmentation in the adversarial training, which operates in a sample-wise manner to increase the prior uncertainty. Second, we incorporate a frame-level uncertainty prediction module that estimates the posterior uncertainty, enabling the model to allocate more learning capacity to low-confidence segments. Empirical results on the Opencpop and Ofuton-P, across Chinese and Japanese, demonstrate that our approach improves performance in various perspectives."}

This is the authors' accepted manuscript version", "summary": "In this paper, we address the challenge of dynamic spectrum access in a cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) network where a secondary user (SU) operates under both energy constraints and adversarial interference from a smart jammer. The SU coexists with primary users (PUs) and must ensure that its transmissions do not exceed a predefined interference threshold on licensed channels. At each time slot, the SU must jointly determine whether to transmit or harvest energy, which channel to access, and the appropriate transmit power while satisfying energy and interference constraints. Meanwhile, a smart jammer actively selects a channel to disrupt, aiming to degrade the SU's communication performance. This setting presents a significant challenge due to its multi-level decision structure and hybrid action space, which combines both discrete and continuous decisions. To tackle this, we propose a novel Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (H-DDPG) framework that decomposes the decision-making process into three levels: the high-level policy determines the mode (transmit or harvest), the mid-level policy selects the channel, and the low-level actor outputs a continuous power level. Concurrently, the jammer is modeled as a reinforcement learning agent that learns an adaptive channel jamming strategy using a discrete variant of DDPG. Simulation results show that our H-DDPG approach outperforms conventional flat reinforcement learning baselines."}

However, conventional detection algorithms, such as linear equalizers and message passing (MP) methods, either suffer from noise enhancement or fail under complex doubly-selective channels, especially in the presence of fractional delay and Doppler shifts. In this paper, we propose a hybrid low-complexity iterative detection framework that combines linear minimum mean square error (L-MMSE) estimation with MP-based probabilistic inference. The key idea is to apply a new delay-Doppler (DD) commutation precoder (DDCP) to the DD domain signal vector, such that the resulting effective channel matrix exhibits a structured form with several locally dense blocks that are sparsely inter-connected. This precoding structure enables a hybrid iterative detection strategy, where a low-dimensional L-MMSE estimation is applied to the dense blocks, while MP is utilized to exploit the sparse inter-block connections. Furthermore, we provide a detailed complexity analysis, which shows that the proposed scheme incurs lower computational cost compared to the full-size L-MMSE detection. The simulation results of convergence performance confirm that the proposed hybrid MP detection achieves fast and reliable convergence with controlled complexity. In terms of error performance, simulation results demonstrate that our scheme achieves significantly better bit error rate (BER) under various channel conditions. Particularly in multipath scenarios, the BER performance of the proposed method closely approaches the matched filter bound (MFB), indicating its near-optimal error performance."}

Mohrenschildt"], "title": "Rethinking Gaussian-Windowed Wavelets for Damping Identification", "comment": null, "summary": "In modal analysis, the prevalent use of Gaussian-based wavelets (such as Morlet and Gabor) for damping estimation is rarely questioned. In this study, we challenge this conventional approach by systematically exploring envelope-based damping estimators and proposing a data-driven framework that optimizes the shape and parameters of the envelope utilizing synthetic impulse responses with known ground-truth envelopes. The performance of the resulting estimators is benchmarked across a range of scenarios and compared against frequency-domain damping estimation methods, including Least Squares Rational Function (LSRF), poly-reference Least Squares Complex Frequency-Domain (pLSCF), peak picking (PP), and the Yoshida method. Our findings indicate that Triangle and Welch windows consistently outperform or are on par with Gaussian wavelet methods in contexts of moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). In contrast, Blackman filtering demonstrates superior robustness under low SNR conditions and scenarios involving closely spaced modes. Among the frequency-domain methods assessed, LSRF shows the most reliability at very low SNR; however, the non-Gaussian optimized envelope estimators perform exceptionally well as the SNR improves."}

RED is a technique developed for image restoration that uses an efficient (and sometimes black-box) denoiser in the regularization term of the optimization problem. By using RED, optimization problems can be designed with the explicit use of the denoiser, and the gradient of the regularization term can be easily computed under mild conditions. We adapt RED for denoising of graph signals beyond image processing. We show that many graph signal denoisers, including graph neural networks, theoretically or practically satisfy the conditions for RED. We also study the effectiveness of RED from a graph filter perspective. Furthermore, we propose supervised and unsupervised parameter estimation methods based on deep algorithm unrolling. These methods aim to enhance the algorithm applicability, particularly in the unsupervised setting. Denoising experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed method improves signal denoising accuracy in mean squared error compared to existing graph signal denoising methods."}

This paper investigates a downlink multi-user multi-antenna system, and tackles the above challenges by introducing orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission. Specifically, OTFS enables stable characterization of time-varying channels by representing them in the delay-Doppler domain. However, realistic propagation introduces various inter-symbol and inter-user interference due to non-orthogonal yet practical rectangular pulse shaping, fractional delays, Doppler shifts, and imperfect (statistical) CSIT. In this context, RSMA offers promising robustness for interference mitigation and CSIT imperfections, and hence is integrated with OTFS to provide a comprehensive solution. A compact cross-domain input-output relationship for RSMA-OTFS is established, and an ergodic sum-rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a weighted minimum mean-square-error based alternating optimization algorithm that does not depend on channel sparsity. Simulation results reveal that the considered practical propagation effects significantly degrade performance if unaddressed. Furthermore, the RSMA-OTFS scheme demonstrates improved ergodic sum-rate and robustness against CSIT uncertainty across various user deployments and CSIT qualities."}

Both single-waveguide (SW) and multi-waveguide (MW) structures are considered. SW consists of multiple alternatingly activated subarrays, while MW deploys one subarray on each waveguide to enable concurrent subarray measurements. For the 2D scenarios with a fixed user/scatter height, an orthogonal matching pursuit-based geometry-consistent localization (OMP-GCL) algorithm is proposed, which leverages inter-subarray geometric relationships and compressed sensing for precise estimation. Theoretical analysis on Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) demonstrates that: 1) The estimation accuracy can be improved by increasing the geometric diversity through multi-subarray deployment; and 2) SW provides a limited geometric diversity within a $180^\\circ$ half space and leads to angle ambiguity, while MW enables full-space observations and reduces overheads. The OMP-GCL algorithm is further extended to 3D scenarios, where user and scatter heights are also estimated. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis, and verify that MW achieves centimeter- and decimeter-level localization accuracy in 2D and 3D scenarios with only three waveguides."}

We propose a randomized sparse resource allocation scheme based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design tailored for the multi-static scenario to simultaneously mitigate inter-BS interference (IBI) and sensing ambiguities. The waveform design also ensures robustness against inter-symbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI) via a judicious choice of subcarrier spacing according to the deployment of BSs. The potential ambiguity caused by sparse signaling is addressed through controlled irregularity in both time and frequency domains, with a negligible noise floor elevation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed design in the presence of multiple targets and clutter."}

This method minimizes the time resources required to sweep over the whole coverage while ensuring that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio received by users is above a given threshold. It discusses the design of: (i) an Earth-fixed grid of beam layouts; (ii) beamforming vectors and beam power allocation; (iii) beam hopping patterns and (iv) space, time and frequency resource allocation of 3GPP common signaling. Two main beam layout solutions are proposed to significantly reduce the number of beams required to illuminate the coverage area: one based on phased array beams with low beam crossover levels and the other on widened beams. A numerical evaluation using practical system parameters showed that both solutions perform similarly, but that the best result is obtained with phased arrays beams with optimized beam cross over levels. Indeed, for the system evaluated, they allowed reducing the total number of beams from 1723 to 451, which combined with a proper beam hopping pattern and scheduling scheme allowed obtaining a coverage ratio of 100% and a common signaling efficiency (i.e. number of slots carrying common signaling over total number of slots) up to 80.6% for the most stringent common signaling periodicity of 20 ms considered by 3GPP."}

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which can dynamically manipulate electromagnetic wave propagation, provide a solution to enhance THz coverage. To investigate multi-RIS deployment scenarios, this work integrates an antenna array-based RIS model into the ray-tracing simulation platform.

This arXiv version is the authors' accepted manuscript", "summary": "This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for hybrid underlay-overlay cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-energy harvesting (EH) and cooperative caching. Unlike prior hierarchical DRL approaches that focus primarily on spectrum access or power control, our work jointly optimizes EH, hybrid access coordination, power allocation, and caching in a unified framework. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a weighted-sum multi-objective task, designed to maximize throughput and cache hit ratio while simultaneously minimizing transmission delay. In the proposed model, CIoT agents jointly optimize EH and data transmission using a learnable time switching (TS) factor. They also coordinate spectrum access under hybrid overlay-underlay paradigms and make power control and cache placement decisions while considering energy, interference, and storage constraints. Specifically, in this work, cooperative caching is used to enable overlay access, while power control is used for underlay access. A novel three-level hierarchical SAC (H-SAC) agent decomposes the mixed discrete-continuous action space into modular subproblems, improving scalability and convergence over flat DRL methods. The high-level policy adjusts the TS factor, the mid-level policy manages spectrum access coordination and cache sharing, and the low-level policy decides transmit power and caching actions for both the CIoT agent and PU content. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical SAC approach significantly outperforms benchmark and greedy strategies. It achieves better performance in terms of average sum rate, delay, cache hit ratio, and energy efficiency, even under channel fading and uncertain conditions."}

Delay--Doppler (DD)-domain ISAC offers a more robust foundation under high mobility, but it requires a suitable DD-domain pulse-shaping filter. The prevailing DD pulse designs are either communication-centric or static, which limits adaptation to non-stationary channels and diverse application demands. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the tunable Gaussian pulse (TGP), a DD-native, analytically tunable pulse shape parameterized by its aspect ratio \\( γ\\), chirp rate \\( α_c \\), and phase coupling \\( β_c \\). On the sensing side, we derive closed-form Cramér--Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) that map \\( (γ,α_c,β_c) \\) to fundamental delay and Doppler precision. On the communications side, we show that \\( α_c \\) and \\( β_c \\) reshape off-diagonal covariance, and thus inter-symbol interference (ISI), without changing received power, isolating capacity effects to interference structure rather than power loss. A comprehensive trade-off analysis demonstrates that the TGP spans a flexible operational region from the high capacity of the Sinc pulse to the high precision of the root raised cosine (RRC) pulse. Notably, TGP attains near-RRC sensing precision while retaining over \\( 90\\% \\) of Sinc's maximum capacity, achieving a balanced operating region that is not attainable by conventional static pulse designs."}

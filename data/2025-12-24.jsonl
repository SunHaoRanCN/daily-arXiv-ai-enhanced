Achieving accurate binaural signals with these systems is challenging, as they often employ arbitrary microphone arrays with limited spatial resolution. The Binaural Signals Matching with Magnitude Least-Squares (BSM-MagLS) method was developed to address limitations of earlier BSM formulations, improving reproduction at high frequencies and under head rotation. However, its accuracy still degrades as head rotation increases, resulting in spatial and timbral artifacts, particularly when the virtual listener's ear moves farther from the nearest microphones. In this work, we propose the integration of deep learning with BSM-MagLS to mitigate these degradations. A post-processing framework based on the SpatialNet network is employed, leveraging its ability to process spatial information effectively and guided by both signal-level loss and a perceptually motivated binaural loss derived from a theoretical model of human binaural hearing. The effectiveness of the approach is investigated in a simulation study with a six-microphone semicircular array, showing its ability to perform robustly across head rotations. These findings are further studied in a listening experiment across different reverberant acoustic environments and head rotations, demonstrating that the proposed framework effectively mitigates BSM-MagLS degradations and provides robust correction across substantial head rotations."}

It is therefore promising to design a unified framework capable of handling multiple tasks, while providing robust instruction and audio understanding and high-quality audio generation. This requires a compatible paradigm design, a powerful backbone, and a high-fidelity audio reconstruction module. To meet these requirements, this technical report introduces QuarkAudio, a decoder-only autoregressive (AR) LM-based generative framework that unifies multiple tasks. The framework includes a unified discrete audio tokenizer, H-Codec, which incorporates self-supervised learning (SSL) representations into the tokenization and reconstruction process. We further propose several improvements to H-Codec, such as a dynamic frame-rate mechanism and extending the audio sampling rate to 48 kHz. QuarkAudio unifies tasks by using task-specific conditional information as the conditioning sequence of the decoder-only LM, and predicting discrete target audio tokens in an AR manner. The framework supports a wide range of audio processing and generation tasks, including speech restoration (SR), target speaker extraction (TSE), speech separation (SS), voice conversion (VC), and language-queried audio source separation (LASS). In addition, we extend downstream tasks to universal free-form audio editing guided by natural language instructions (including speech semantic editing and audio event editing). Experimental results show that H-Codec achieves high-quality audio reconstruction with a low frame rate, improving both the efficiency and performance of downstream audio generation, and that QuarkAudio delivers competitive or comparable performance to state-of-the-art task-specific or multi-task systems across multiple tasks."}

Conventional generative formulations often treat each dataset sample as a fixed representative of the target distribution. From a generative standpoint, however, such samples are only one among many perceptually equivalent variants within the true speech distribution. To address this, we propose Linear Projection Conditional Flow Matching (LP-CFM), which models targets as projection-aligned elongated Gaussians along perceptually equivalent variants. We further introduce Vector Calibrated Sampling (VCS) to keep the sampling process aligned with the line-projection path. In neural vocoding experiments across model sizes, data scales, and sampling steps, the proposed approach consistently improves over the conventional optimal transport CFM, with particularly strong gains in low-resource and few-step scenarios. These results highlight the potential of LP-CFM and VCS to provide more robust and perceptually grounded generative modeling of speech."}

Distinct from conventional joint modulation schemes, our approach establishes two logically independent transmission channels--SFM and DBM--thereby eliminating the need for joint signal design or time synchronization. Specifically, the orthogonality of vortex wave modes is exploited to construct a high-capacity multi-mode DBM channel, in which each mode carries modulated symbols independently. As the composite waveform passes through the PMS, energy from different vortex modes is spatially focused onto distinct positions, dynamically determined by the PMS configuration. This spatial mapping forms a unique lookup table that encodes additional information in the electro-magnetic (EM) field distribution, effectively enabling a second, concurrent SFM channel. To enhance physical-layer security, the DBM channel transmits encrypted symbols transformed via dynamic symbol-domain mapping, while the corresponding mapping relations--or key information--are carried by the SFM channel. This lightweight dual-channel encryption strategy provides strong confidentiality without requiring complex joint decoding. To validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we design and implement a proof-of-concept prototype system, and conduct experimental demonstrations under real-world wireless communication conditions. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the co-existent DBM-SFM design in achieving reliable and secure transmission. The proposed architecture offers a scalable, low-complexity, and secure transmission solution for future IoT networks, especially in scenarios demanding both spectral efficiency and physical-layer confidentiality."}

Training-free methods often suffer from signal degradation caused by diffusion inversion, while training-based methods, although achieving higher generation quality, are severely constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired data and task formulations that cover only a narrow subset of editing operations. In addition, standard architectures typically decouple text and audio processing, limiting the ability to align instructions with specific acoustic contexts.\n  To address these challenges, we propose MMEdit, an audio-language-model-driven framework for unified audio editing. We systematically extend task definitions to cover a comprehensive range of editing operations, including addition, replacement, removal, reordering, and attribute modification. Furthermore, we design a scalable data synthesis pipeline to construct large-scale paired datasets with fine-grained event-level annotations.

Unauthorized sensing eavesdroppers (Eve) can potentially exploit the ISAC signal for their own independent passive sensing. However, solutions for sensing-secure ISAC remain largely unexplored to date. This work addresses sensing-security for OFDM- and OTFS-based ISAC waveforms from a target-detection perspective, aiming to prevent Eves from exploiting the ISAC signal for unauthorized passive sensing. We develop ISAC system models for the base station (BS), communication user equipment, and the sensing Eve, and define a Kullback-Leibler-divergence-based detection metric that accounts for mainlobe, sidelobe, and noise components in the ambiguity function and the resulting range-Doppler maps of the legitimate BS's and Eve's sensing. Building on this analysis, we formulate a sensing-secure ISAC signaling design problem that tunes a perturbation matrix to jointly control signal amplitude and phase in the time-frequency domain and solve it via simulated annealing. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme substantially degrades Eve's detection probability -- from 79.4% to 37.4% for OTFS and from 94.3% to 33.0% for OFDM -- while incurring only a small loss in BS sensing performance. In addition, it allows controllable trade-offs across sensing-security and communication performance."}

However, conventional static RIS architectures lack the flexibility required for adaptive beam control in multi-user and multifunctional scenarios. To address this issue without introducing additional hardware complexity and power consumption, in this paper, we exploit a movable RIS (MRIS) architecture, which consists of a large fixed sub-surface and a smaller movable sub-surface that slides on the fixed sub-surface to achieve dynamic beam reconfiguration with static phase shifts. This paper investigates an MRIS-assisted ISAC system under imperfect sensing estimation, where dedicated radar signals serve as artificial noise to enhance secure transmission against potential eavesdroppers (Eves). The transmit beamforming vectors, MRIS phase shifts, and relative positions of the two sub-surfaces are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum secrecy rate, ensuring robust secrecy performance for the weakest user under the uncertainty of the Eves' channels. To handle the non-convexity, a convex bound is derived for the Eve channel uncertainty, and the S-procedure is employed to reformulate semi-infinite constraints as linear matrix inequalities. An efficient alternating optimization and penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MRIS architecture substantially improves secrecy performance, especially when only a small number of elements are allocated to the movable sub-surface."}

To bridge this gap, this paper presents an initial study investigating the feasibility of ATR for ISAC. Our ATR solution uses a Deep Learning (DL)-based detector to infer the target class directly from the radar images generated by the ISAC system. The DL detector is evaluated with experimental data from a ISAC testbed based on commercially available mmWave radio units in the ARENA 2036 industrial research campus located in Stuttgart, Germany. Experimental results demonstrate accurate classification performance, demonstrating the feasibility of ATR ISAC with cellular hardware in our setup. We finally provide insights about the open generalization challenges, that will fuel future work on the topic."}

Offline measurements typically involve time delays that may be unknown a priori due to the underlying laboratory procedures. This multirate (MR) setting poses a challenge to Kalman filtering, where conventionally measurement data is assumed to be available on an equidistant time grid and without delays. The present study derives the MR version of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on sample state augmentation, and applies it to the anaerobic digestion (AD) process in a simulative agricultural setting. The performance of the MR-EKF is investigated for various scenarios, i.e., varying delay lengths, measurement noise levels, plant-model mismatch (PMM), and initial state error. Provided with an adequate tuning, the MR-EKF could be demonstrated to reliably estimate the process state, to appropriately fuse delayed offline measurements, and to smooth noisy online measurements well. Because of the sample state augmentation approach, the delay length of offline measurements does not critically impair state estimation performance, provided observability is not lost during the delays. Poor state initialization and PMM affect convergence more than measurement noise levels. Further, selecting an appropriate tuning was found to be critically important for successful application of the MR-EKF, for which a systematic approach is presented. This study provides implementation guidance for practitioners aiming at successfully applying state estimation for multirate systems. It thereby contributes to develop demand-driven operation of biogas plants, which may aid in stabilizing a renewable electricity grid."}

To enhance the anti-jamming capability of the considered system, an MA array is deployed at the receiver, and the antenna positions and the minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) receive beamformer are jointly optimized to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The main challenge arises from the fact that the interference covariance matrix is unknown and nonlinearly dependent on the antenna positions. To overcome these issues, we propose a surrogate objective by replacing the unknown covariance with the sample covariance evaluated at the current antenna position anchor. Under a two-timescale framework, the surrogate objective is updated once per block (contains multiple snapshots) at the current anchor position, while the MVDR beamformer is adapted on a per-snapshot basis. We establish a local bound on the discrepancy between the surrogate and the true objective by leveraging matrix concentration inequalities, and further prove that a natural historical-averaging surrogate suffers from a non-vanishing geometric bias. Building on these insights, we develop a low-complexity projected trust-region (TR) surrogate optimization (PTRSO) algorithm that maintains the locality of each iteration via TR constraints and enforces feasibility through projection, which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point near the anchor. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PTRSO algorithm, which consistently achieves higher output SINR than existing baselines."}

Book chapter", "summary": "Goal-oriented communications offer an attractive alternative to the Shannon-based communication paradigm, where the data is never reconstructed at the Receiver (RX) side. Rather, focusing on the case of edge inference, the Transmitter (TX) and the RX cooperate to exchange features of the input data that will be used to predict an unseen attribute of them, leveraging information from collected data sets. This chapter demonstrates that the wireless channel can be used to perform computations over the data, when equipped with programmable metasurfaces. The end-to-end system of the TX, RX, and MS-based channel is treated as a single deep neural network which is trained through backpropagation to perform inference on unseen data. Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), it is shown that this Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network (MINN) can achieve performance comparable to fully digital neural networks under various system parameters and data sets. By offloading computations onto the channel itself, important benefits may be achieved in terms of energy consumption, arising from reduced computations at the transceivers and smaller transmission power required for successful inference."}

Among existing methods, upsampling-based time-domain models are superior in both inference speed and synthesis quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Still, despite their success in producing perceptually natural sound, their synthesis fidelity remains limited due to the aliasing artifacts brought by the inadequately designed model architectures. In particular, the unconstrained nonlinear activation generates an infinite number of harmonics that exceed the Nyquist frequency, resulting in ``folded-back'' aliasing artifacts. The widely used upsampling layer, ConvTranspose, copies the mirrored low-frequency parts to fill the empty high-frequency region, resulting in ``mirrored'' aliasing artifacts. Meanwhile, the combination of its inherent periodicity and the mirrored DC bias also brings ``tonal artifact,'' resulting in constant-frequency ringing. This paper aims to solve these issues from a signal processing perspective. Specifically, we apply oversampling and anti-derivative anti-aliasing to the activation function to obtain its anti-aliased form, and replace the problematic ConvTranspose layer with resampling to avoid the ``tonal artifact'' and eliminate aliased components. Based on our proposed anti-aliased modules, we introduce Pupu-Vocoder and Pupu-Codec, and release high-quality pre-trained checkpoints to facilitate audio generation research. We build a test signal benchmark to illustrate the effectiveness of the anti-aliased modules, and conduct experiments on speech, singing voice, music, and audio to validate our proposed models. Experimental results confirm that our lightweight Pupu-Vocoder and Pupu-Codec models can easily outperform existing systems on singing voice, music, and audio, while achieving comparable performance on speech."}

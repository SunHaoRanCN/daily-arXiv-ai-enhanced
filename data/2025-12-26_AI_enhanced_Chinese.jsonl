We present GenTSE, a two-stage decoder-only generative LM approach for TSE: Stage-1 predicts coarse semantic tokens, and Stage-2 generates fine acoustic tokens. Separating semantics and acoustics stabilizes decoding and yields more faithful, content-aligned target speech. Both stages use continuous SSL or codec embeddings, offering richer context than discretized-prompt methods. To reduce exposure bias, we employ a Frozen-LM Conditioning training strategy that conditions the LMs on predicted tokens from earlier checkpoints to reduce the gap between teacher-forcing training and autoregressive inference.

Our architecture employs two complementary components: 1) An Encoder-Decoder Attractor (EDA) network that automatically infers both the source count and corresponding acoustic clues for SS, and 2) A multi-modal fusion network that precisely interprets diverse user-provided clues (acoustic, semantic, or visual) for TSE. Through joint training with cross-task consistency constraints, we establish a unified latent space that bridges both paradigms.

However, neither architecture is adequate to flexibly support distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) services, due to the increasing difficulty of aligning spatiotemporally distributed heterogeneous service demands with available radio resources. In this paper, we propose an elastic network topology (ENT) for distributed ISAC service provisioning, where multiple co-existing localized CCNs can be dynamically aggregated into CFNs with expanded boundaries for federated network operation. This topology elastically orchestrates localized CCN and federated CFN boundaries to balance signaling overhead and distributed resource utilization, thereby enabling efficient ISAC service provisioning. A two-phase operation protocol is then developed. In Phase I, each CCN autonomously classifies ISAC services as either local or federated and partitions its resources into dedicated and shared segments. In Phase II, each CCN employs its dedicated resources for local ISAC services, while the aggregated CFN consolidates shared resources from its constituent CCNs to cooperatively deliver federated services. Furthermore, we design a utility-to-signaling ratio (USR) to quantify the tradeoff between sensing/communication utility and signaling overhead. Consequently, a USR maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the network topology (i.e., service classification and CCN aggregation) and the allocation of dedicated and shared resources. However, this problem is challenging due to its distributed optimization nature and the absence of complete channel state information. To address this problem efficiently, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with centralized training and decentralized execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251(ENT)\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fISAC\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u5408CCN\u4e3aCFN\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u8bae\u548cMADRL\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316USR", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CCN/CFN\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fISAC\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u6784\u670d\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u53ef\u7528\u65e0\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u56f0\u96be", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251(ENT)\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u591a\u4e2aCCN\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u5408\u4e3aCFN\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u64cd\u4f5c\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5CCN\u81ea\u4e3b\u5206\u7c7bISAC\u670d\u52a1\u5e76\u5212\u5206\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u5904\u7406\u672c\u5730\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u805a\u5408CFN\u6574\u5408\u5171\u4eab\u8d44\u6e90\u5904\u7406\u8054\u90a6\u670d\u52a1\uff1b\u91c7\u7528MADRL\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316USR\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u8bbe\u8ba1USR\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5/\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMADRL\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "ENT\u80fd\u591f\u5f39\u6027\u7f16\u6392CCN\u548cCFN\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684ISAC\u670d\u52a1\u4f9b\u7ed9"}}

Piano reduction is an important music transformation process, which helps musicians and composers as a musical sketch for performances and analysis. The automation of such is a highly challenging research problem but could bring huge conveniences as manually doing a piano reduction takes a lot of time and effort. While supervised machine learning is often a useful tool for learning input-output mappings, it is difficult to obtain a large quantity of labelled data. We aim to solve this problem by utilizing semi-supervised learning, so that the abundant available data in classical music can be leveraged to perform the task with little or no labelling effort. In this regard, we formulate a two-step approach of music simplification followed by harmonization. We further propose and implement two possible solutions making use of an existing machine learning framework -- MidiBERT. We show that our solutions can output practical and realistic samples with an accurate reduction that needs only small adjustments in post-processing.

However, current coordination models often struggle with unreliable data, intentional misinformation, and the breakdown of critical communication infrastructure. A decentralized, vote-based blockchain model offers a compelling substrate for achieving this real-time, trusted coordination. This article explores a blockchain-driven approach to rapidly update a dynamic 3D crisis map based on inputs from users and local sensors. Each node submits a timestamped and geotagged vote to a public ledger, enabling agencies to visualize needs as they emerge. However, ensuring the physical authenticity of these claims demands more than cryptography alone. We propose a dual-layer architecture where mobile UAV verifiers perform physical-layer attestation and issue independent location flags to the blockchain. This dual-signature mechanism fuses immutable digital records with sensory-grounded trust. We analyze core technical and human centric challenges, ranging from spoofing and vote ambiguity to verifier compromise and connectivity loss, and outline layered mitigation strategies and future research directions. As a concrete instantiation, we present a UAV mapping scheme leveraging modulated retro-reflector (MRR) sensors and 3D-aware LoS placement to maximize verifiability under urban occlusion, offering a path toward resilient, trust-anchored crisis coordination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u707e\u96be\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u4fe1\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u6295\u7968\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u707e\u96be\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u534f\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u6545\u610f\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5d29\u6e83\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u662f\u7528\u6237\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u63d0\u4ea4\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u548c\u5730\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6295\u7968\u5230\u516c\u5171\u8d26\u672c\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u662f\u79fb\u52a8\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u5236\u540e\u5411\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c3D\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u8ddd\u5e03\u7f6e\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u6570\u5b57\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u611f\u5b98\u57fa\u7840\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u53cc\u7b7e\u540d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6b3a\u9a97\u3001\u6295\u7968\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u53d7\u635f\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e22\u5931\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u707e\u96be\u534f\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f39\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7269\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u5371\u673a\u534f\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

A centralized quantum hub emits entangled photons, directing one toward a target device and the other toward a local reference unit. The target, equipped with a planar CCR array, reflects the incoming photon without active circuitry, enabling secure round-trip quantum measurements for sub-nanosecond synchronization and localization. We develop a comprehensive analytical model that captures key physical-layer phenomena, including Gaussian beam spread, spatial misalignment, atmospheric turbulence, and probabilistic photon generation. A closed-form expression is derived for the single-photon detection probability under Gamma-Gamma fading, and its distribution is used to model photon arrival events and synchronization error.

We introduce the area-based signal-to-noise ratio (aSNR) as a robust alternative that integrates the signal over a defined region of interest, reducing noise variance and improving detection for various lineshapes. We used Monte Carlo simulations (n=2,000 trials per condition) to test aSNR on Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt lineshapes. We found that aSNR requires significantly lower amplitudes than pSNR to achieve a 50% detection probability. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves show that aSNR performs better than pSNR at low amplitudes. Our results show that aSNR works especially advantageously for broad peaks and could be extended to volume-based SNR for multidimensional spectra.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9762\u79ef\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4(aSNR)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5cf0\u503c\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4(pSNR)\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79ef\u5206\u533a\u57df\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bbd\u5cf0\u68c0\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfpSNR\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u5c16\u5cf0\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5bbd\u5cf0\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684SNR\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faaSNR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u5185\u79ef\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df(\u6bcf\u79cd\u6761\u4ef62000\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c)\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9ad8\u65af\u3001\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u548cVoigt\u7ebf\u578b", "result": "aSNR\u6bd4pSNR\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u523050%\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff1bROC\u66f2\u7ebf\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4f4e\u632f\u5e45\u4e0baSNR\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bbd\u5cf0\u68c0\u6d4b", "conclusion": "aSNR\u662fpSNR\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u7ef4\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u57faSNR\uff0c\u5728\u5bbd\u5cf0\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a"}}

However, the extreme sensitivity of optical beams to relative satellite motion, pointing jitter, and rapidly evolving geometry makes routing fundamentally more challenging than in RF-based systems. In particular, intra-plane and inter-plane ISLs exhibit markedly different stability and feasible range profiles, producing a dynamic, partially constrained connectivity structure that must be respected by any physically consistent routing strategy. This paper presents a lightweight geometry- and QoS-aware routing framework for optical LEO networks that incorporates class-dependent feasibility constraints derived from a jitter-aware Gaussian-beam model. These analytically computed thresholds are embedded directly into the time-varying ISL graph and enforced via feasible-action masking in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent. The proposed method leverages local geometric progress, feasible-neighbor structure, and congestion indicators to select next-hop relays without requiring global recomputation. Simulation results on a Starlink-like constellation show that the learned paths are physically consistent, exploit intra-plane stability, adapt to jitter-limited inter-plane connectivity, and maintain robust end-to-end latency under dynamic topology evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u5b66LEO\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0eQoS\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6296\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8def\u7531\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u5b66\u661f\u95f4\u94fe\u8def\uff08ISL\uff09\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LEO\u661f\u5ea7\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u4fe1\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u4f46\u5149\u5b66\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u536b\u661f\u76f8\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u6307\u5411\u6296\u52a8\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6781\u5176\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8def\u7531\u6bd4RF\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5e73\u9762\u5185\u548c\u5e73\u9762\u95f4ISL\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0eQoS\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6296\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9608\u503c\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u65f6\u53d8ISL\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a9\u7801\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u8fdb\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u90bb\u5c45\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u62e5\u585e\u6307\u6807\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u4e00\u8df3\u4e2d\u7ee7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3cStarlink\u7684\u661f\u5ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u9762\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6296\u52a8\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u95f4\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u62d3\u6251\u6f14\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5149\u5b66LEO\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8def\u7531\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Existing studies address this impairment using technology-specific definitions, models, and mitigation approaches, which hinders cross-domain comparison and transferable design insight. This survey provides a unified treatment of pointing errors across optical and high frequency wireless communications. We establish consistent terminology and a cross-technology taxonomy of pointing errors, review angular misalignment and statistical distribution models, and analyze their impact on system performance. Mitigation techniques are systematically surveyed with emphasis on optical systems and their connection to underlying pointing error models. The survey further provides a detailed examination of pointing-error effects in orbital angular momentum (OAM) links and quantum optical communications, and surveys the corresponding mitigation approaches tailored to mode-dependent impairments and quantum measurement constraints. The survey also outlines open challenges and future research directions.

However, there is still a lack of comprehensive reviews on the integration of SemCom into RAN. Motivated by this, we systematically explore recent advancements in Semantic RAN (SemRAN). We begin by introducing the fundamentals of RAN and SemCom, identifying the limitations of conventional RAN, and outlining the overall architecture of SemRAN. Subsequently, we review representative techniques of SemRAN across physical layer, data link layer, network layer, and security plane. Furthermore, we envision future services and applications enabled by SemRAN, alongside its current standardization progress.

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) act as low-power programmable apertures that redirect energy without the cost and power consumption of fully active arrays. We develop a deployment-first, operations-aware view of RIS-enabled satellite networking that treats RIS as both satellite/terminal antennas and inter-satellite or space-ground relays. We show that system-level gains are governed by two unifying mechanisms: connectivity restoration via virtual line-of-sight links that preserve connectivity under blockage and mobility, and angular selectivity that reshapes interference to enlarge spectrum reuse. We further discuss practical operation under high mobility, highlighting Delay-Doppler channel acquisition, predictive beam tracking, and control designs that budget overhead and latency, and summarize hardware considerations for reliable operation in space. Finally, we outline forward-looking opportunities in the generative artificial intelligence paradigm, multifunctional RIS architectures, ubiquitous satellite integrated sensing and communication, and sustainable satellite Internet-of-Things.", "AI": {"tldr": "RIS\u8d4b\u80fd\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u89c6\u8ddd\u8fde\u63a5\u6062\u590d\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u5851\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u906e\u6321\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u76846G\u536b\u661f\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u906e\u6321\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u65ad\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u536b\u661f\u5c42\u95f4\u3001\u661f\u5730\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u53476G\u536b\u661f\u8986\u76d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u5148\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u611f\u77e5\u7684RIS\u8d4b\u80fd\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06RIS\u540c\u65f6\u7528\u4f5c\u536b\u661f/\u7ec8\u7aef\u5929\u7ebf\u4ee5\u53ca\u661f\u95f4\u6216\u661f\u5730\u4e2d\u7ee7\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5ef6\u8fdf\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u4fe1\u9053\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6ce2\u675f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u589e\u76ca\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u89c6\u8ddd\u94fe\u8def\u6062\u590d\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff08\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u63a5\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89d2\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u5851\u5e72\u6270\u4ee5\u6269\u5927\u9891\u8c31\u590d\u7528\u3002\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u8003\u8651\u3002", "conclusion": "RIS\u4e3a\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u673a\u4f1a\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u8303\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u529f\u80fdRIS\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6cdb\u5728\u536b\u661f\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u536b\u661f\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7b49\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We consider a downlink scenario where a base station (BS) with an active rotatable array serves multiple communication users and senses low-altitude targets, assisted by a rotatable reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). A rotation-aware geometry-based multipath model is developed to capture the impact of three-dimensional (3D) array orientations on both steering vectors and direction-dependent element gains. On this basis, we formulate a new optimization problem that maximizes the downlink sum rate subject to a transmit power budget, RIS unit-modulus constraints, mechanical rotation limits, and a sensing beampattern mean-squared-error (MSE) constraint. To address the resulting highly non-convex problem, we propose a penalty-based alternating-optimization (AO) framework that alternately updates the BS precoder, RIS phase shifts, and BS/RIS array rotation angles. The three blocks are efficiently handled via a convex optimization method based on quadratic-transform (QT) and majorization-minorization (MM), Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) on the unit-modulus manifold, and projected gradient descent (PGD) with Barzilai-Borwein step sizes, respectively. Numerical results in low-altitude geometries demonstrate that the proposed jointly rotatable BS-RIS architecture achieves significant sum-rate gains over fixed or partially rotatable baselines while guaranteeing sensing requirements, especially with directional antennas and in interference-limited regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e3b\u52a8\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u9635\u5217\u7684\u4f4e\u7a7a\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u7ad9\u548cRIS\u7684\u534f\u540c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u611f\u77e5\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u548c\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u9635\u5217\u5728\u4f4e\u7a7aISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u57fa\u7ad9\u9635\u5217\u548cRIS\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u4f4e\u7a7a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1) \u5efa\u7acb\u8003\u8651\u4e09\u7ef4\u9635\u5217\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u611f\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u591a\u5f84\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efa\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0b\u884c\u548c\u901f\u7387\u3001\u6ee1\u8db3\u529f\u7387\u3001RIS\u76f8\u4f4d\u3001\u673a\u68b0\u65cb\u8f6c\u9650\u5236\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6ce2\u675f\u6a21\u5f0fMSE\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ad9\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001RIS\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u548cBS/RIS\u9635\u5217\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\uff1b4) \u91c7\u7528QT-MM\u3001\u9ece\u66fc\u5171\u8f6d\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5404\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u5408\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6cBS-RIS\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u611f\u77e5\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u548c\u901f\u7387\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b9a\u5411\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ad9\u548cRIS\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u7a7aISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f4e\u7a7a\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This development is creating an unprecedented spaceborne GNSS network, offering new opportunities for network-driven precise LEO orbit and clock estimation. Yet, current onboard GNSS processing is largely standalone and often insufficient for high-precision applications, while centralized fusion is challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the lack of in-orbit infrastructure. In this work, we report a decentralized GNSS network over large-scale LEO constellations, where each satellite processes its own measurements while exchanging compact information with neighboring nodes to enable precise orbit and time determination. We model the moving constellation as a dynamic graph and tailor a momentum-accelerated gradient tracking (GT) method to ensure steady convergence despite topology changes. Numerical simulations with constellations containing hundreds of satellites show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of an ideal centralized benchmark, while substantially reducing communication burdens.

The study aims to evaluate the interference risk with other wireless systems, and electromagnetic safety of a private 5G network in the 3.9-4.1 GHz band, while ensuring compatibility with legacy wireless systems, such as LTE and Wi-Fi. We conducted a measurement campaign, employing state-of-the-art instrumentation and a methodology that combined high resolution and long-duration spectrum scans. The results demonstrate no measurable interference between the hospital's private 5G network with adjacent LTE (4G) or Wi-Fi bands, confirming the spectral isolation of the 5G transmissions, and vise versa. Additionally, RF exposure levels in the operating room were found to be well below ICNIRP, WHO, and IEEE safety thresholds, ensuring that the network poses negligible biological risk to patients and hospital staff.

Highly directional beams utilized to overcome the attenuation in these frequencies necessitate robust and efficient beamforming schemes. Nevertheless, antenna and beam management approaches still face challenges in highly mobile solutions, such as vehicular connectivity, with increasing number of bands. In this work, the concepts of spectrum mobility is studied along with antenna array management in multiple frequencies to improve beamforming under mobility. The spectrum mobility problem aims to select the optimal channel frequency and beam direction in each time slot to maximize data rate. This problem is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI) algorithm is used to find a policy with performance guarantees. Numerical examples confirm the efficacy of the resulting policy for multiple available frequency bands, even when the user mobility significantly deviates from models assumed during policy generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u9891\u6bb5\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7POMDP\u5efa\u6a21\u548cPBVI\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2FR2\uff0824-71 GHz\uff09\u548c\u65b0\u5174FR3\uff087-24 GHz\uff09\u9891\u6bb5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u5927\u5e26\u5bbd\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6ce2\u675f\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\uff09\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9891\u8c31\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08POMDP\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u7684\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\uff08PBVI\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bfb\u627e\u5177\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u9699\u7684\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u7528\u9891\u6bb5\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5f53\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u65f6\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u8c31\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u79fb\u52a8\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Michael Buehrer"], "title": "Neural Network-Assisted RIS Weight Optimization for Spatial Nulling in Distorted Reflector Antenna Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have recently been proposed as an effective means for spatial interference suppression in large reflector antenna systems. Existing RIS weight optimization algorithms typically rely on accurate theoretical radiation models. However, in practice, distortions on the reflector antenna may cause mismatches between the theoretical and true antenna patterns, leading to degraded interference cancellation performance when these weights are directly applied. In this report, a residual learning network-assisted simulated annealing (ResNet-SA) framework is proposed to address this mismatch without requiring explicit knowledge of the distorted electric field. By learning the residual difference between the theoretical and true antenna gains, a neural network (NN) is embedded in a heuristic optimization algorithm to find the optimal weight vector. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves improved null depth in the true radiation pattern as compared with conventional methods that optimize weights based solely on the theoretical model, validating the effectiveness of the ResNet-SA algorithm for reflector antenna systems with approximate knowledge of the pattern.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faResNet-SA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u53cd\u5c04\u9762\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7406\u8bba\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5929\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u56fe\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u53cd\u5c04\u9762\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5929\u7ebf\u53d8\u5f62\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7406\u8bba\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5929\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u56fe\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7684RIS\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u7535\u573a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faResNet-SA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5929\u7ebf\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5929\u7ebf\u589e\u76ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u5411\u91cf\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5931\u771f\u7535\u573a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f90\u5c04\u65b9\u5411\u56fe\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u96f6\u9677\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ResNet-SA\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5177\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u5411\u56fe\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u9762\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ResNet-SA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u53cd\u5c04\u9762\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u65b9\u5411\u56fe\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42\u7cbe\u786e\u7535\u573a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

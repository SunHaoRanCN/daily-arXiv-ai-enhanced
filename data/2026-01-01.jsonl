Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Li-ion batteries is crucial for ensuring their reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness in battery-powered systems. The materials used for the battery cathodes and their designs play a significant role in determining the degradation rates and RUL, as they lead to distinct electrochemical reactions. Unfortunately, RUL prediction models often overlook the cathode materials and designs to simplify the model-building process, ignoring the effects of these electrochemical reactions. Other reasons are that specifications related to battery materials may not always be readily available, and a battery might consist of a mix of different materials. As a result, the predictive models that are developed often lack generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel material-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for predicting the RUL of batteries, specifically addressing the complexities associated with heterogeneous battery chemistries. The MoE is integrated into a probabilistic framework, called Multiple Non-crossing Quantile Mixture-of-Experts for Probabilistic Prediction (RUL-QMoE), which accommodates battery operational conditions and enables uncertainty quantification. The RUL-QMoE model integrates specialized expert networks for five battery types: LFP, NCA, NMC, LCO, and NMC-LCO, within a gating mechanism that dynamically assigns relevance based on the battery's input features. Furthermore, by leveraging non-crossing quantile regression, the proposed RUL-QMoE produces coherent and interpretable predictive distributions of the battery's RUL, enabling robust uncertainty quantification in the battery's RUL prediction."}

We propose a novel entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach where each non-terrestrial base station (NTBS) independently computes its beamforming vector using a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to capture long-range dependencies in the frequency domain. To ensure scalability and robustness, the proposed framework integrates transfer learning based on a conjugate prior mechanism and a low-rank decomposition (LRD) technique, thus enabling efficient support for large-scale user deployments and aerial layers. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over baseline schemes including WMMSE, ZF, MRT, CNN-based DRL, and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method in terms of average sum rate, robustness to CSI imperfection, user mobility, and scalability across varying network sizes and user densities. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method achieves significant computational efficiency compared to CNN-based and WMMSE methods, while reducing communication overhead in comparison with shared-critic DRL approaches."}

While Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continental-scale services such as the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provide dense observations of past motion, predicting the next observation remains challenging due to the superposition of long-term trends, seasonal cycles, and occasional abrupt discontinuities (e.g., co-seismic steps), together with strong spatial heterogeneity. In this study we propose a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series (resampled to a 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles). The model ingests recent displacement snapshots together with (i) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from the training window only, and (ii) harmonic day-of-year encodings. On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the STGCN is strongest in the displacement-only setting, whereas the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and $R^2$ = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies."}

Although this problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve it by leveraging the similarity between the considered multi-region coverage and classical multi-notch filter (MNF) design. In particular, we construct a spatial MNF-based transmit beamforming vector by assuming a continuous amplitude and phase-shift profile within the antenna movement region. Based on this continuous profile, we propose a sequential update algorithm to select an optimal subset of MA positions for multi-region coverage, jointly with a Gibbs sampling (GS) procedure to avoid undesired local optimum. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform conventional fixed position antennas (FPAs) and achieve a comparable performance to the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with dramatically lower complexity."}

As a result, these are susceptible to the failure of even a single sensor. Contrarily, two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRSAs) and robust minimum redundancy arrays (RMRAs) ensure robustness against single-sensor failures due to their inherent redundancy in their coarrays. At present, optimal RMRA configurations are known only for arrays with sensor counts N=6 to N=10. To this end, this paper proposes two objectives: (i) developing a systematic algorithm to discover optimal RMRAs for N>10, and (ii) obtaining a new family of near-/sub-optimal RMRA that can be completely specified using closed-form expressions (CFEs). We solve the combinatorial optimization problem of finding RMRAs using an exhaustive search technique implemented in MATLAB. Optimal RMRAs for N = 11 to 14 were successfully found and near/sub-optimal arrays for N = 15 to 20 were determined using the proposed technique. As a byproduct of the exhaustive search, a large catalogue of valid near- and sub-optimal RMRAs was also obtained. In the second stage, CFEs for a new TFRSA were obtained by applying pattern mining and algebraic generalizations to the arrays obtained through exhaustive search. The proposed family enjoys CFEs for sensor positions, available aperture, and achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs). The CFEs have been thoroughly validated using MATLAB and are found to be valid for $N\\geq8$. Hence, it can be concluded that the novelty of this work is two-fold: extending the catalogue of known optimal RMRAs and formulating a sub-optimal RMRA that abides by CFEs."}

However, existing T2AV models remain incapable of generating physically plausible sounds, primarily due to their limited understanding of physical principles. To situate current research progress, we present PhyAVBench, a challenging audio physics-sensitivity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the audio physics grounding capabilities of existing T2AV models. PhyAVBench comprises 1,000 groups of paired text prompts with controlled physical variables that implicitly induce sound variations, enabling a fine-grained assessment of models' sensitivity to changes in underlying acoustic conditions. We term this evaluation paradigm the Audio-Physics Sensitivity Test (APST). Unlike prior benchmarks that primarily focus on audio-video synchronization, PhyAVBench explicitly evaluates models' understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying sound generation, covering 6 major audio physics dimensions, 4 daily scenarios (music, sound effects, speech, and their mix), and 50 fine-grained test points, ranging from fundamental aspects such as sound diffraction to more complex phenomena, e.g., Helmholtz resonance. Each test point consists of multiple groups of paired prompts, where each prompt is grounded by at least 20 newly recorded or collected real-world videos, thereby minimizing the risk of data leakage during model pre-training. Both prompts and videos are iteratively refined through rigorous human-involved error correction and quality control to ensure high quality. We argue that only models with a genuine grasp of audio-related physical principles can generate physically consistent audio-visual content. We hope PhyAVBench will stimulate future progress in this critical yet largely unexplored domain."}

To address this, we introduce the AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework.

Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives."}

Shaping their power spectral density (PSD) is imperative in the increasingly overcrowded spectrum to benefit from the cognitive radio (CR) paradigm.

This work proposes a framework that allows using a reduced set of preoptimized pulses to shape the spectrum of OFDM signals, irrespective of its spectral width and location, by means of simple transformations. The employed pulses combine active interference cancellation (AIC) and adaptive symbol transition (AST) terms in a transparent way to the receiver. They can be easily adapted online by the communication device to changes in the location or width of the transmission band, which contrasts with existing methods of the same type that require solving NP-hard optimization problems."}

We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment. These results highlight the potential of quantitative voice biomarkers as scalable, non-invasive tools for early screening, diagnostic triage, and longitudinal monitoring of vocal health."}

We propose a Backscatter-Constrained Transmit Antenna Selection (BC-TAS) framework, a per-subcarrier selection strategy for multi-antenna illuminators operating within a Multi-Dimensional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MD-OFDM) architecture. Unlike conventional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) centric selection schemes, BC-TAS employs a multi-objective cost function that jointly maximizes desired link reliability, stabilizes the incident RF energy envelope at passive Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors, and suppresses interference toward coexisting victim receivers. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of MD-OFDM, the proposed framework enables dual-envelope regulation, simultaneously reducing the transmitter Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and the Backscatter Crest Factor (BCF) observed at the tag. To enhance robustness under imperfect Channel State Information (CSI), a Kalman-based channel smoothing mechanism is incorporated to maintain selection stability in low-SNR regimes. Numerical results using IEEE 802.11be dispersive channel models and a nonlinear Rapp power amplifier demonstrate that BC-TAS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in outage probability and significant gains in energy efficiency compared to conventional MU-MIMO baselines, while ensuring spectral mask compliance under reduced power amplifier back-off.

It manages Doppler effects by utilizing delay-Doppler (DD) domain processing. However, the relatively long OTFS frame duration could introduce considerable sensing or communication latency when radar and communication are performed separately. By operating in a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) mode, the OTFS system performs sensing and data transmission simultaneously, thereby reducing the resulting latency. Nevertheless, the optimal OTFS DFRC signal strategy remains insufficiently explored. This paper investigates the optimal signal design for OTFS DFRC systems, focusing on pilot symbol design and data symbol power allocation. Specifically, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric for communication that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. For sensing, we derive an integrated sidelobe level (ISL), accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. Leveraging the above metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that balances radar and communication performance, and then solve it using an alternating optimization framework. We validate the proposed signal through numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis shows that OTFS DFRC enforces a deterministic pilot signal that is characterized by a concentrated peak in the DD domain, which furnishes a common structure in the DD domain facilitating sensing and channel estimation, with data multiplexed in other DD grids, thereby unifying sensing and communication within a single OTFS signal. Compared with conventional OTFS signals, the proposed OTFS DFRC signal expands the achievable sensing-communication performance region, delivering at least a 9.45 dB ISL suppression for sensing and a 4.82 dB SINR ratio gain for communication."}

To enable accurate and efficient target localization, we formulate the angle estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery problem and develop a modified matching pursuit algorithm tailored to the hierarchical sensing architecture. Additionally, we design power allocation strategies that minimize total transmit power while meeting performance requirements for both sensing and communication. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over conventional sensing methods with reduced sensing power."}

Specifically, quantized discrete values are encoded into binary sequences using the two's complement and transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, we design a decoder that constructs a functional mapping between the superimposed digital modulation signals and the target of computational results, theoretically ensuring asymptotic error free computation with the minimal codeword length. To further mitigate the adverse effects of channel fading, we adopt a truncated inversion strategy for pre-processing. Benefiting from the unified symbol distribution after the proposed encoding, we derive the optimal linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector in closed form and propose a low complexity algorithm seeking for the optimal truncation selection. Furthermore, the inherent importance differences among the coded outputs motivate an uneven power allocation strategy across subcarriers to improve computational accuracy. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing digital AirComp approaches, especially at low signal to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes."}

This paper investigates a wireless powered ISAC system with target localization requirements, where users harvest energy from wireless power transfer (WPT) and then conduct ISAC transmissions in a time-division manner. In addition to energy supply, the WPT signal also contributes to target sensing, and the localization accuracy is characterized by Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) constraints. Under this setting, we formulate a max-min throughput maximization problem by jointly allocating the WPT duration, ISAC transmission time allocation, and transmit power. Due to the nonconvexity of the resulting problem, a suitable reformulation is developed by exploiting variable substitutions and the monotonicity of logarithmic functions, based on which an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate convergence and significant performance gains over benchmark schemes, highlighting the importance of coordinated time-power optimization in balancing sensing accuracy and communication performance in wireless powered ISAC systems."}

However, current mainstream HPR solutions relying on vision or radio-frequency (RF) (including WiFi, radar) still face various challenges in practical deployment, such as privacy concerns, susceptibility to occlusion, dedicated equipment and functions, and limited sensing resolution and range. 5G-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, by merging communication and sensing functions, offers a new approach to address these challenges in contactless HPR. We propose a practical 5G-based ISAC system capable of inferring 2D HPR from uplink sounding reference signals (SRS). Specifically, rich features are extracted from multiple domains and employ an encoder to achieve unified alignment and representation in a latent space. Subsequently, low-dimensional features are fused to output the human pose state. Experimental results demonstrate that in typical indoor environments, our proposed 5G-based ISAC HPR system significantly outperforms current mainstream baseline solutions in HPR performance, providing a solid technical foundation for universal human-computer interaction."}

However, the ELAAs worked in extremely high frequency will push operation into the near-field region, where spherical wavefronts invalidate classical far-field models and alter fundamental estimation limits. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part II) is to develop the theory of fundamental limits for near-field sensing systems in detail. In this paper (Part I), we develop a unified narrow-band near-field signal model for joint parameter sensing of moving targets using the ELAAs. Leveraging the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive closed-form Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) under the slow-time sampling model. To obtain interpretable insights, we further establish explicit far-field and near-field approximations that reveal how the bounds scale with array aperture, target range, carrier wavelength, and coherent integration length. The resulting expressions expose the roles of self-information terms and their cross terms, clarifying when Fresnel corrections become non-negligible and providing beamformer and algorithm design guidelines for near-field sensing with ELAAs. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and their far-field and near-field approximations, demonstrating accurate agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative array sizes and target ranges."}

The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part I) is to develop the unified Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for sensing systems spanning from far-field to near-field, and narrow-band to wide-band. This paper (Part II) derives fundamental estimation limits for a wide-band near-field sensing systems employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signaling over a coherent processing interval. We establish an exact near-field wide-band signal model that captures frequency-dependent propagation, spherical-wave geometry, and the intrinsic coupling between target location and motion parameters across subcarriers and slow time. Similar as Part I using the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive the wide-band Fisher information matrix and the CRBs for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section, and we show how wide-band information aggregates across orthogonal subcarriers. We further develop tractable far-field and near-field approximations which provide design-level insights into the roles of bandwidth, coherent integration length, and array aperture, and clarify when wide-band effects. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and its approximations, demonstrating close agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative ranges, bandwidths, and array configurations."}

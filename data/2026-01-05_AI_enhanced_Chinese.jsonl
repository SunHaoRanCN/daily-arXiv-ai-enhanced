Consequently, developing deep learning methods that can effectively process EEG signals remains an open and important research problem. To tackle this problem, this work presents a new method inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). In computer vision, NeRF techniques train a neural network to memorize the appearance of a 3D scene and then uses its learned parameters to render and edit the scene from any viewpoint. We draw an analogy between the discrete images captured from different viewpoints used to learn a continuous 3D scene in NeRF, and EEG electrodes positioned at different locations on the scalp, which are used to infer the underlying representation of continuous neural activity. Building on this connection, we show that a neural network can be trained on a single EEG sample in a NeRF style manner to produce a fixed size and informative weight vector that encodes the entire signal. Moreover, via this representation we can render the EEG signal at previously unseen time steps and spatial electrode positions. We demonstrate that this approach enables continuous visualization of brain activity at any desired resolution, including ultra high resolution, and reconstruction of raw EEG signals. Finally, our empirical analysis shows that this method can effectively simulate nonexistent electrodes data in EEG recordings, allowing the reconstructed signal to be fed into standard EEG processing networks to improve performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7NeRF\u542f\u53d1\u7684EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06EEG\u7535\u6781\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4e3aNeRF\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u7801\u6574\u4e2aEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u865a\u62df\u7535\u6781\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u3001\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u6781\u4f4e\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274NeRF\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u5c06EEG\u7535\u6781\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4e3aNeRF\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5355\u4e2aEEG\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5411\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u6574\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\u3001\u539f\u59cb\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u865a\u62df\u7535\u6781\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u51c6EEG\u5904\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684NeRF\u98ce\u683c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9EEG\u6570\u636e\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u865a\u62df\u7535\u6781\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Preventing HF can reduce morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) applied to 24-hour single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data could predict the risk of HF within five years. To research this, the Technion-Leumit Holter ECG (TLHE) dataset, including 69,663 recordings from 47,729 patients, collected over 20 years was used. Our deep learning model, DeepHHF, trained on 24-hour ECG recordings, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 that outperformed a model using 30-second segments and a clinical score. High-risk individuals identified by DeepHHF had a two-fold chance of hospitalization or death incidents. Explainability analysis showed DeepHHF focused on arrhythmias and heart abnormalities, with key attention between 8 AM and 3 PM. This study highlights the feasibility of deep learning to model 24-hour continuous ECG data, capturing paroxysmal events and circadian variations essential for reliable risk prediction.

A probabilistic system model is introduced to capture the impact of imperfect localization on outage performance and secrecy. Based on this model, a joint antenna-positioning and transmit-power optimization problem is formulated to satisfy probabilistic reliability and secrecy requirements. To enable rapid adaptation in highly dynamic environments, the proposed approach employs model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to learn a transferable initialization across diverse mobility and channel conditions, allowing few-shot online adaptation using limited pilot feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms Reptile-based meta-learning, non-meta reinforcement learning, conventional optimization, static antenna placement, and power-only control in terms of outage probability, secrecy performance, and convergence latency.

Traditional channel estimation methods face scalability challenges due to the surging overhead in emerging high-mobility, extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (EL-MIMO), and multi-band systems. CSI extrapolation techniques mitigate these challenges by using partial CSI to infer complete CSI, significantly reducing overhead. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art (SOTA) CSI extrapolation techniques is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by comprehensively reviewing the current status, challenges, and future directions of CSI extrapolation for the first time. Firstly, we analyze the performance metrics specific to CSI extrapolation in 6G, including extrapolation accuracy, adaption to dynamic scenarios and algorithm costs. We then review both model-driven and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches for time, frequency, antenna, and multi-domain CSI extrapolation.

To enhance recognition performance, the Weighted Finite-State Transducer (WFST) is widely adopted to integrate acoustic and language models through static graph composition, providing robust decoding and effective error correction. However, WFST decoding relies on a frame-by-frame autoregressive search over CTC posterior probabilities, which severely limits inference efficiency. Motivated by establishing a more principled compatibility between WFST decoding and CTC modeling, we systematically study the two fundamental components of CTC outputs, namely blank and non-blank frames, and identify a key insight: blank frames primarily encode positional information, while non-blank frames carry semantic content. Building on this observation, we introduce Keep-Only-One and Insert-Only-One, two decoding algorithms that explicitly exploit the structural roles of blank and non-blank frames to achieve significantly faster WFST-based inference without compromising recognition accuracy. Experiments on large-scale in-house, AISHELL-1, and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art recognition accuracy with substantially reduced decoding latency, enabling truly efficient and high-performance WFST decoding in modern speech recognition systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Keep-Only-One\u548cInsert-Only-One\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528CTC\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u7a7a\u767d\u5e27\u548c\u975e\u7a7a\u767d\u5e27\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347WFST\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eWFST\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56CTC\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u7684\u9010\u5e27\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acbWFST\u89e3\u7801\u4e0eCTC\u5efa\u6a21\u4e4b\u95f4\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790CTC\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u7a7a\u767d\u5e27\u548c\u975e\u7a7a\u767d\u5e27\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7a7a\u767d\u5e27\u4e3b\u8981\u7f16\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7a7a\u767d\u5e27\u643a\u5e26\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faKeep-Only-One\u548cInsert-Only-One\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u767d\u5e27\u548c\u975e\u7a7a\u767d\u5e27\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u89d2\u8272\u6765\u52a0\u901fWFST\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001AISHELL-1\u548cLibriSpeech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684WFST\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3CTC\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u7a7a\u767d\u5e27\u548c\u975e\u7a7a\u767d\u5e27\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684WFST\u89e3\u7801\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, because synthesis relies on prior samples while training uses posterior latents inferred from real recordings, imperfect distribution matching can cause a prior-posterior mismatch that degrades fine-grained expressiveness such as vibrato and micro-prosody. We propose FM-Singer, which introduces conditional flow matching (CFM) in latent space to learn a continuous vector field transporting prior latents toward posterior latents along an optimal-transport-inspired path. At inference time, the learned latent flow refines a prior sample by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) before waveform generation, improving expressiveness while preserving the efficiency of parallel decoding. Experiments on Korean and Chinese singing datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, including lower mel-cepstral distortion and fundamental-frequency error and higher perceptual scores on the Korean dataset.

Multiply-accumulate~(MAC) is considered a {\\textit de facto} unit operation in NNs. By leveraging the inherent parallel processing capabilities of CiM, NNs that require numerous MAC operations can be executed more efficiently. This is further facilitated by storing the weights in SRAM, reducing the need for extensive data movement and enhancing overall computational speed and efficiency. Traditional CiM architectures execute MAC operations in the analog domain, employing an Analog-to-Digital converter (ADC) to convert the analog MAC values into digital outputs. However, these ADCs introduce significant increase in area and power consumption, as well as introduce non-linearities. This work proposes a resonant time-domain compute-in-memory (TDC-CiM) architecture that eliminates the need for an ADC by using a time-to-digital converter (TDC) to digitize analog MAC results with lower power and area cost. A dedicated 8T SRAM cell enables reliable bitwise MAC operations, while the readout uses a 4-bit TDC with pulse-shrinking delay elements, achieving 1 GS/s sampling with a power consumption of only 1.25 mW. In addition, a weight stationary data mapping strategy combined with an automated SRAM macro selection algorithm enables scalable and energy-efficient deployment across CNN workloads. Evaluation across six CNN models shows that the algorithm reduces inference energy consumption by up to 8x when scaling SRAM size from 32~KB to 256~KB, while maintaining minimal accuracy loss after quantization. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is validated on an 8~KB SRAM memory array using TSMC 28~nm technology.

By contrast, for large-scale systems, a closed-form BER approximation associated with the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector is presented, including realistic imperfect channel estimation scenarios. Our first key observation is that the full diversity order of a hardware-impaired AFDM system remains unaffected, which is a unique advantage. Furthermore, our analysis shows that 1) the BER results derived accurately predict the simulated ML performance in moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the theoretical BER curve of the LMMSE detector closely matches that of the Monte-Carlo based one. 2) MIMO-AFDM is more resilient to multiplicative distortions, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, compared to its orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) counterparts. This is attributed to its inherent chirp signal characteristics; 3) MIMO-AFDM consistently achieves superior BER performance compared to conventional MIMO-OFDM systems under the same additive HWI conditions, as well as different velocity values. The latter is because MIMO-AFDM is also resilient to the additional inter-carrier interference (ICI) imposed by the nonlinear distortions of additive HWIs. In a nutshell, compared to OFDM, AFDM demonstrates stronger ICI resilience and achieves the maximum full diversity attainable gain even under HWIs, thanks to its intrinsic chirp signalling structure as well as to the beneficial spreading effect of the discrete affine Fourier transform.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u5bf9MIMO-AFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AFDM\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u96c6\u9636\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4OFDM\u5bf9\u4e58\u6027\u548c\u52a0\u6027\u635f\u4f24\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e58\u6027\u548c\u52a0\u6027\u635f\u4f24\uff09\u5bf9MIMO-AFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfMIMO-OFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21MIMO-AFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6BER\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u95ed\u5f0fBER\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "1) \u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u7684AFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u96c6\u9636\u6570\uff1b2) \u63a8\u5bfc\u7684BER\u7ed3\u679c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u7684ML\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3) MIMO-AFDM\u6bd4OFDM\u5bf9\u4e58\u6027\u5931\u771f\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b4) \u5728\u76f8\u540c\u52a0\u6027\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cMIMO-AFDM\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8eMIMO-OFDM\u3002", "conclusion": "AFDM\u51ed\u501f\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5541\u557e\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u6027\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u4eff\u5c04\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6709\u76ca\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4OFDM\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8f7d\u6ce2\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5927\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u96c6\u589e\u76ca\u3002"}}

Combining audio inputs with a range of text prompts as queries to find out the viability of MLLMs to learn robust representations across modalities for audio deepfake detection. Therefore, we attempt to explore text-aware and context-rich, question-answer based prompts with binary decisions. We hypothesise that such a feature-guided reasoning will help in facilitating deeper multimodal understanding and enable robust feature learning for audio deepfake detection. We evaluate the performance of two MLLMs, Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct and SALMONN, in two evaluation modes: (a) zero-shot and (b) fine-tuned. Our experiments demonstrate that combining audio with a multi-prompt approach could be a viable way forward for audio deepfake detection.

However, the associated optimization problem is highly nonconvex due to the intricate coupling of log-determinant and matrix trace terms. Existing solutions often suffer from high computational complexity, typically requiring matrix inversion at every iteration. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient optimization framework based on fractional programming (FP). Our key idea is to reformulate the KLD maximization problem into a sequence of tractable quadratic subproblems using matrix FP. To further reduce complexity, we introduce a nonhomogeneous relaxation technique that replaces the costly linear system solver with a simple closed-form update, thereby reducing the per-iteration complexity to quadratic order. To compensate for the convergence speed trade-off caused by relaxation, we employ an acceleration method called STEM by interpreting the iterative scheme as a fixed-point mapping.

To address these issues, this work proposes WiFo-MUD, a universal diffusion-based foundation model for multi-user demodulation.

In addition, two reconfigurable metasurfaces are deployed, one in the immediate vicinity of the transmit antenna array, and one in the immediate vicinity of the receive antenna array. The resulting architecture implements a holographic beamforming structure at both the transmitter and receiver. In this scenario, the system energy efficiency is optimized with respect to the transmit covariance matrix, and the reflection matrices of the two metasurfaces. A low-complexity algorithm is developed, which is guaranteed to converge to a first-order optimal point of the energy efficiency maximization problem. Moreover, closed-form expressions are derived for the metasurface matrices in the special case of single-antenna or single-stream transmission. The two metasurfaces are considered to be nearly-passive and subject to global reflection constraints. A numerical performance analysis is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed optimization methods, showing, in particular, that the use of holographic beamforming by metasurfaces can provide significant energy efficiency gains compared to fully digital beamforming architectures, even when the latter achieve substantial multiplexing gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u53d1\u5c04\u7aef\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u90fd\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u65e0\u7ebf\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u53d1\u5c04\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u53cd\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u8017\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5168\u606f\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u6709\u671b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53d1\u5c04\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u9644\u8fd1\u5404\u90e8\u7f72\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u8d85\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5168\u606f\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u53d1\u5c04\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e00\u9636\u6700\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5355\u5929\u7ebf/\u5355\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5168\u606f\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u8457\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u540e\u8005\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89c2\u7684\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5168\u606f\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

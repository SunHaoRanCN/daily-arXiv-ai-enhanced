However, its practical deployment remains hindered by strong residual self-interference and inter-user interference, which severely degrade system performance. This work investigates a full-duplex MISO network that leverages movable-antenna base stations (MA-BS) and movable-element reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ME-RIS) to overcome these limitations in next-generation 6G systems. Unlike conventional fixed-geometry architectures, the proposed framework jointly optimizes antenna and RIS element positions, together with RIS phase shifts, to strengthen desired links while suppressing interference. Our design objective is to maximize the system sum rate through the joint optimization of transmit and receive beamforming vectors, uplink transmit powers, RIS phase shifts, and the spatial locations of both the BS antennas and RIS elements. To solve this challenging nonconvex problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed, employing semidefinite relaxation for beamforming design and successive convex approximation for position optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ME-RIS-assisted architecture with movable BS antennas offers substantial gains over conventional fixed-position full-duplex networks. These findings highlight the potential of integrating movable antennas with movable RIS elements as a key enabler for high-performance full-duplex operation in future 6G wireless systems."}

Existing tokenizers either prioritize semantic encoding, fuse semantic content with acoustic style inseparably, or achieve incomplete semantic-acoustic disentanglement. To achieve better disentanglement, we propose DSA-Tokenizer, which explicitly disentangles speech into discrete semantic and acoustic tokens via distinct optimization constraints. Specifically, semantic tokens are supervised by ASR to capture linguistic content, while acoustic tokens focus on mel-spectrograms restoration to encode style. To eliminate rigid length constraints between the two sequences, we introduce a hierarchical Flow-Matching decoder that further improve speech generation quality.Furthermore, We employ a joint reconstruction-recombination training strategy to enforce this separation. DSA-Tokenizer enables high fidelity reconstruction and flexible recombination through robust disentanglement, facilitating controllable generation in speech LLMs. Our analysis highlights disentangled tokenization as a pivotal paradigm for future speech modeling.

We analyze the covariance deviation induced by channel variations to establish a theoretical bound based on channel correlation for determining the sensing window size. To mitigate residual interference from finite sampling, a deep learning (DL) classifier is integrated.

Predictive coding algorithms reduce the bit-rate required for data transmission or storage by signal prediction. The prediction gain is a classic measure in applied signal coding of the quality of a predictor, as it links the mean-squared prediction error to the signal-to-quantization-noise of predictive coders. To evaluate predictor models, knowledge about the maximum achievable prediction gain independent of a predictor model is desirable. In this manuscript, Nadaraya-Watson kernel-regression (NWKR) and an information theoretic upper bound are applied to analyze the upper bound of the prediction gain on a newly recorded dataset of sustained speech/phonemes. It was found that for unvoiced speech a linear predictor always achieves the maximum prediction gain within at most 0.3 dB. On voiced speech, the optimum one-tap predictor was found to be linear but starting with two taps, the maximum achievable prediction gain was found to be about 2 dB to 6 dB above the prediction gain of the linear predictor. Significant differences between speakers/subjects were observed.\n  The created dataset as well as the code can be obtained for research purpose upon request."}

It enables improved emergency response coordination and is critical for protecting infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems from extreme hydrological events. Process-based hydrological models and purely data-driven approaches often underperform during extreme events, particularly in forecasting peak flows. To address this limitation, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that couples Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF). XGBoost is employed for continuous streamflow forecasting, while RF is specifically trained for peak-flow prediction, and the two outputs are combined into an enhanced forecast. The approach is implemented across 857 catchments of the LamaH-CE dataset, using rainfall and discharge observations at 6-hour resolution. Results demonstrate consistently high skill, with 71% of catchments achieving a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) greater than 0.90. Peak-flow detection reaches 87%, with a false-alarm rate of 13%. Compared to the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), the framework achieves lower peak-magnitude errors, fewer false alarms, and improved streamflow and peak-flow forecasting accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally lightweight, scalable, and easily transferable across watersheds, with training times of only seconds on standard CPUs. These findings highlight the potential of integrating hydrological understanding with efficient machine learning to improve the accuracy and reliability of operational flood forecasting, and outline future directions for hybrid hydrological-machine learning model development."}

Oversampling and pulse shaping are also discussed in the existing literature, but not in the context of channel estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to address the problem of data-to-pilot and vice versa energy leakage caused by oversampling and pulse shaping in OTFS. Theoretical analysis is performed on an oversampled, pulse-shaped OTFS implementing the embedded pilot channel estimation technique, revealing a trade-off between the amount of energy leakage and excess bandwidth introduced by the pulse shape. Next, a novel variant of OTFS is introduced, called UW-OTFS, which is designed to overcome the leakage problem by placing the pilot in the oversampled time domain instead of the DD domain. The unique structure of UW-OTFS offers 36 percent higher spectral efficiency than the OTFS with embedded pilot. UW-OTFS also outperforms traditional OTFS in terms of bit error ratio and out-of-band emissions."}

Submitted to IEEE ICC 2026", "summary": "Cell-Free Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) have been active research topics in the wireless communication community in recent years. As an open-source software implementation of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 5th Generation (5G) protocol stack, OpenAirInterface (OAI) has become a valuable tool for deploying and testing new ideas in wireless communication systems. In this paper, we present our OAI based real-time uplink Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) testbed developed at Fraunhofer HHI. As a part of our Cell-Free MIMO testbed development, we built a 2x2 MU-MIMO system using general purpose computers and commercially available software defined radios (SDRs). Using a modified OAI next-Generation Node-B (gNB) and two unmodified OAI user equipment (UE), we show that it is feasible to use Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) channel estimates to compute uplink combiners. Our results verify that this method can be used to separate and decode signals from two users transmitting in nonorthogonal time-frequency resources. This work serves as an important verification step to build a complete Cell-Free MU-MIMO system that leverages time domain duplexing (TDD) reciprocity to do downlink beamforming over multiple cells."}

Precisely, the maximum possible shortfall relative to the gain attainable with ideal phase shifters is established. Such shortfall is shown to be fundamentally determined by the perimeter of the convex hull of the set of feasible beamforming coefficients on the complex plane. This result holds regardless of whether the beamforming is at the transmitter, at the receiver, or at a reconfigurable intelligent surface. In i.i.d. fading channels, the shortfall hardens to the maximum possible shortfall as the number of antennas grows."}

Specifically, IRSs are selectively deployed from candidate sites to shape the propagation geometry, while MAs are locally repositioned among discretized locations to exploit small-scale channel variations. The objective is to minimize the total deployment cost of MAs and IRSs by jointly optimizing the IRS site selection, MA positions, transmit precoding, and IRS phase shifts, subject to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for all target areas. This leads to a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem that is intractable to solve directly. To address this, we first formulate an auxiliary problem to verify the feasibility. A penalty-based double-loop algorithm integrating alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA) is developed to solve this feasibility issue, which is subsequently adapted to obtain a suboptimal solution for the original cost minimization problem. Finally, based on the obtained solution, we formulate an element refinement problem to further reduce the deployment cost, which is solved by a penalty-based SCA algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed designs consistently outperform benchmarks relying on independent area planning or full IRS deployment in terms of cost-efficiency. Moreover, for cost minimization, MA architectures are preferable in large placement apertures, whereas fully populated FPA architectures excel in compact ones; for worst-case SNR maximization, MA architectures exhibit a lower cost threshold for feasibility, while FPA architectures can attain peak SNR at a lower total cost."}

A space-time reconfigurable intelligent surface (ST-RIS) impresses a continuous-phase modulation onto the radar echo, enabling uplink data transmission with a phase modulation of the transmitted radar-like waveform. The received signal is a multiplicative composition of the sensing waveform and the phase for communication. Both functionalities share the same physical signal and perceive each other as impairments.\n  The achievable communication rate is expressed as a function of a coupling parameter that links sensing accuracy to phase error accumulation. Under a fixed bandwidth constraint, the sensing and communication figures of merit define a convex Pareto frontier. The optimal bandwidth allocation satisfying a minimum sensing requirement is derived in closed form. The modified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) for range estimation is derived in closed form; this parameter must be estimated to compensate for the frequency offset before data demodulation. Frame synchronization is formulated as a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and the detection probability is obtained through characteristic function inversion, accounting for residual frequency errors from imperfect range estimation. Numerical results validate the theoretical bounds and characterize the trade-off across the operating range."}

Code available at https://github.com/fahimehorvatinia/GAN-LSTM-Smart-Meter-Anomaly-Detection", "summary": "Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) provides high-resolution electricity consumption data that can enhance monitoring, diagnosis, and decision making in modern power distribution systems. Detecting anomalies in these time-series measurements is challenging due to nonlinear, nonstationary, and multi-scale temporal behavior across diverse building types and operating conditions. This work presents a systematic, power-system-oriented evaluation of a GAN-LSTM framework for smart meter anomaly detection using the Large-scale Energy Anomaly Detection (LEAD) dataset, which contains one year of hourly measurements from 406 buildings. The proposed pipeline applies consistent preprocessing, temporal windowing, and threshold selection across all methods, and compares the GAN-LSTM approach against six widely used baselines, including statistical, kernel-based, reconstruction-based, and GAN-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-LSTM significantly improves detection performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.89. These findings highlight the potential of adversarial temporal modeling as a practical tool for supporting asset monitoring, non-technical loss detection, and situational awareness in real-world power distribution networks.

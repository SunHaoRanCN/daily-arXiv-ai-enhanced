An attention-guided network fuses audio mixtures with EEG features through a lightweight fusion layer, producing attended-source electrodograms for CI stimulation while resolving the label-permutation ambiguity of audio-only separators. Robustness to degraded attention cues is improved with a mixed curriculum that varies cue quality during training, yielding stable gains even when EEG-speech correlation is moderate. In multi-talker conditions, the model achieves higher signal-to-interference ratio improvements than an audio-only electrodogram baseline while remaining slightly smaller (167k vs. 171k parameters). With 2 ms algorithmic latency and comparable cost, the approach highlights the promise of coupling auditory and neural cues for cognitively adaptive CI processing."}

Recent work has proposed syllables as promising speech tokens at low temporal resolution, but existing models are constrained to English and fail to capture sufficient acoustic detail. To address this gap, we present Sylber 2.0, a self-supervised framework for coding speech at the syllable level that enables efficient temporal compression and high-fidelity reconstruction. Sylber 2.0 achieves a very low token frequency around 5 Hz, while retaining both linguistic and acoustic detail across multiple languages and expressive styles. Experiments show that it performs on par with previous models operating on high-frequency baselines. Furthermore, Sylber 2.0 enables efficient TTS modeling which can generate speech with competitive intelligibility and quality with SOTA models using only 72M parameters. Moreover, the universality of Sylber 2.0 provides more effective features for low resource ASR than previous speech coding frameworks. In sum, we establish an effective syllable-level abstraction for general spoken language."}

Using the Bridge2AI-Voice dataset, a multi-institutional collection of pathological voices, we systematically examine three performance-critical factors: reconstruction loss (Mean Absolute Error vs. Mean Squared Error), normalization (patch-wise vs. global), and masking (random vs. content-aware). Our optimized design, which combines Mean Absolute Error (MA-Error) loss, patch-wise normalization, and content-aware masking, achieves a Macro F1 of $0.688 \\pm 0.009$ (over 10 fine-tuning runs), outperforming a strong out-of-domain SSL baseline pre-trained on large-scale general audio, which has a Macro F1 of $0.663 \\pm 0.011$.

An S5 system takes a multi-channel audio mixture as input and outputs single-channel dry sources along with their corresponding class labels. Although the DCASE 2025 Challenge simplifies the task by constraining class labels in each mixture to be mutually exclusive, real-world mixtures frequently contain multiple sources from the same class. The presence of duplicated labels can significantly degrade the performance of the label-queried source separation (LQSS) model, which is the key component of many existing S5 systems, and can also limit the validity of the official evaluation metric of DCASE 2025 Task 4. To address these issues, we propose a class-aware permutation-invariant loss function that enables the LQSS model to handle queries involving duplicated labels. In addition, we redesign the S5 evaluation metric to eliminate ambiguities caused by these same-class sources. To evaluate the proposed method within the S5 system, we extend the label prediction model to support same-class labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and the robustness of the new metric on mixtures both with and without same-class sources."}

The proposed MEP method demonstrated strong performance in both audio quality and evasion effectiveness. The energy masking approach effectively minimizes the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) degradation, indicating that minimal perceptual distortion occurs to the human listener despite the adversarial perturbations.

Polar-domain near-field codebooks can focus energy accurately but incur extra two-dimensional sweeping overhead; compressed-sensing (CS) approaches with Gaussian-masked DFT sensing offer a lower-overhead alternative. This letter revisits near-field beam training using conventional DFT codebooks. Unlike far-field responses that concentrate energy on a few isolated DFT beams, near-field responses produce contiguous, plateau-like energy segments with sharp transitions in the DFT beamspace. Pure LASSO denoising, therefore, tends to over-shrink magnitudes and fragment plateaus. We propose a beam-pattern-preserving beam training scheme for multiple-path scenarios that combines LASSO with a lightweight denoising pipeline: LASSO to suppress small-amplitude noise, followed by total variation (TV) to maintain plateau levels and edge sharpness. The two proximal steps require no near-field codebook design. Simulations with Gaussian pilots show consistent NMSE and cosine-similarity gains over least squares and LASSO at the same pilot budget."}

However, enabling streaming recognition within this framework remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a novel streaming ASR approach that integrates a read/write policy network with monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) to dynamically segment speech embeddings. These segments are interleaved with label sequences during training, enabling seamless integration with the LLM. During inference, the audio stream is buffered until the MoChA module triggers a read signal, at which point the buffered segment together with the previous token is fed into the LLM for the next token prediction. We also introduce a minimal-latency training objective to guide the policy network toward accurate segmentation boundaries. Furthermore, we adopt a joint training strategy in which a non-streaming LLM-ASR model and our streaming model share parameters. Experiments on the AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 Mandarin benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms recent streaming ASR baselines, achieving character error rates of 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively. The latency optimization results in a 62.5% reduction in average token generation delay with negligible impact on recognition accuracy"}

Moreover, the adaptation module is trained jointly with the SE model, potentially prioritizing acoustic details over semantic information, contradicting the original purpose. To address this issue, we first analyze the behavior of SSL models on noisy speech from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we measure the mutual information (MI) between the corrupted SSL representations and the corresponding phoneme labels, focusing on preservation of linguistic contents. Building upon this analysis, we introduce the linguistic aggregation layer, which is pre-trained to maximize MI with phoneme labels (with optional dynamic aggregation) and then frozen during SE training. Experiments show that this decoupled approach improves Word Error Rate (WER) over jointly optimized baselines, demonstrating the benefit of explicitly aligning the adaptation module with linguistic contents."}

Despite recent advances, existing methods continue to suffer from residual interference in complex acoustic scenes. This performance limitation stems largely from a data bottleneck: in-the-wild datasets contain weak labels and severe co-occurrence of events. These flaws induce models to learn spurious correlations between background noise and target categories instead of robust acoustic features. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline that eliminates co-occurrence of events by mining high-purity single-event segments from in-the-wild datasets via a semantically consistent synthesis protocol. Utilizing this pipeline, we constructed Hive, a high-quality synthetic dataset comprising 2.4k hours of raw audio.

Moreover, these models exhibited remarkable zero-shot generalization on out-of-distribution evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight that prioritizing purity of supervised signals enables significant data efficiency, offering a new paradigm for training robust auditory foundation models with reduced computational costs.

Critically, we leverage the In-Context Learning capability of pre-trained LALMs to formulate MCLP via a continuation log-probability prediction. This metric quantifies stylistic consistency by measuring the likelihood of the ground-truth speech conditioned on the generated speech.

The architecture incorporates a microcontroller connected to a single-antenna receiver operating at the same frequency as the RIS unit elements, operating either in transmission or reflection mode. The transmitting RIS elements enable the low latency estimation of both the incoming and outcoming channels at the microcontroller's side. In addition, a machine learning approach for estimating the incoming and outcoming channels involving the remaining RIS elements operating in reflection mode is devised. Specifically, by appropriately selecting a small number of elements in transmission mode, and based on the channel reciprocity principle, the respective channel coefficients are first estimated, which are then fed to a low-complexity neural network that, leveraging spatial channel correlation over RIS elements, returns predictions of the channel coefficients referring to the rest of elements. In this way, the SORIS microcontroller acquires channel state information, and accordingly reconfigures the panel's metamaterials to assist data communication between a transmitter and a receiver, without the need for separate connections with them. Moreover, the impact of channel estimation on the proposed solution, and a detailed complexity analysis for the used model, as well as a wiring density and control signaling analysis, is performed. The feasibility and efficacy of the proposed self-organized RIS design and operation are verified by Monte Carlo simulations, providing useful guidelines on the selection of the RIS elements for operating in transmission mode for initial channel estimation."}

Existing audio large language model (LLM)-based methods excel in content understanding; however, their predictions are often biased toward semantically correlated cues, which results in fine-grained acoustic artifacts being overlooked during the decisionmaking process. Consequently, fake speech with natural semantics can bypass detectors despite harboring subtle acoustic anomalies; this suggests that the challenge stems not from the absence of acoustic data, but from its inadequate accessibility when semantic-dominant reasoning prevails. To address this issue, we investigate SDD within the audio LLM paradigm and introduce SDD with Auditory Perception-enhanced Audio Large Language Model (SDD-APALLM), an acoustically enhanced framework designed to explicitly expose fine-grained time-frequency evidence as accessible acoustic cues. By combining raw audio with structured spectrograms, the proposed framework empowers audio LLMs to more effectively capture subtle acoustic inconsistencies without compromising their semantic understanding. Experimental results indicate consistent gains in detection accuracy and robustness, especially in cases where semantic cues are misleading. Further analysis reveals that these improvements stem from a coordinated utilization of semantic and acoustic information, as opposed to simple modality aggregation."}

MEP applies masking to small energy regions in the frequency domain before generating adversarial perturbations, targeting areas less noticeable to the human auditory model. The study primarily employs advanced speaker recognition models, including ECAPA-TDNN and ResNet34, which have shown remarkable performance in speaker verification tasks. The proposed MEP method demonstrated strong performance in both audio quality and evasion effectiveness. The energy masking approach effectively minimizes the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) degradation, indicating that minimal perceptual distortion occurs to the human listener despite the adversarial perturbations. Specifically, in the PESQ evaluation, the relative performance of the MEP method was 26.68% when compared to the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and iterative FGSM."}

Evaluating and Analyzing Audio Language Model Sycophancy with SYAUDIO", "comment": null, "summary": "Audio Language Models (ALMs) have recently shown strong capabilities in unified reasoning over speech, sound, and natural language; yet they inherit behavioral issues observed in Large Language Models, including sycophancy--the tendency to agree with user assertions even when they contradict objective evidence. While sycophancy has been extensively studied in text and vision-language models, its manifestation in audio-conditioned reasoning remains largely unexplored, despite the need for ALMs to rely on auditory cues such as acoustic events, speaker characteristics, and speech rate. To address this gap, we introduce SYAUDIO, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating sycophancy in ALMs, consisting of 4,319 audio questions spanning Audio Perception, Audio Reasoning, Audio Math, and Audio Ethics. Built upon established audio benchmarks and augmented with TTS-generated arithmetic and moral reasoning tasks, SYAUDIO enables systematic evaluation across multiple domains and sycophancy types with carefully verified data quality. Furthermore, we analyze audio-specific sycophancy under realistic conditions involving noise and rate, and demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning with chain-of-thought data is an effective mitigation strategy for reducing sycophantic behavior in ALMs."}

Akan"], "title": "Intrinsic MIMO Particle Communication Channel with Random Advection", "comment": "6 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "In this work, receiver diversity in advection-dominated diffusion-advection channels is investigated. Strong directed flow fundamentally alters the communication-theoretic properties of molecular communication systems (MC). Specifically, advection preserves the temporal ordering and shape of transmitted pulses, enabling pulse-based and higher-order modulation schemes that are typically infeasible in purely diffusive environments. Focusing on a single transmitter and a single type of information molecule, it is demonstrated that spatially distributed receivers can observe distinct realizations of the same transmitted signal, giving rise to diversity gain. Several receiver combining strategies are evaluated and shown to improve detection performance compared to single-receiver operation, particularly in low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The results provide a structured framework for understanding receiver-side diversity in molecular communication, highlighting the role of advection as a key enabler for reliable pulse-based signaling. This perspective establishes a foundation for future studies on advanced modulation, joint equalization and detection, and multi-molecule MIMO extensions that can further enhance the performance and physical applicability of MC systems."}

Typically, intermediate features are aggregated into a single representation via a lightweight adaptation module. However, most SSL models are not trained for noise robustness, which can lead to corrupted semantic representations. Moreover, the adaptation module is trained jointly with the SE model, potentially prioritizing acoustic details over semantic information, contradicting the original purpose. To address this issue, we first analyze the behavior of SSL models on noisy speech from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we measure the mutual information (MI) between the corrupted SSL representations and the corresponding phoneme labels, focusing on preservation of linguistic contents. Building upon this analysis, we introduce the linguistic aggregation layer, which is pre-trained to maximize MI with phoneme labels (with optional dynamic aggregation) and then frozen during SE training. Experiments show that this decoupled approach improves Word Error Rate (WER) over jointly optimized baselines, demonstrating the benefit of explicitly aligning the adaptation module with linguistic contents."}

Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently been shown to make effective use of limited training data, and prior work on DIFFA indicates that replacing an AR backbone with a diffusion counterpart can substantially improve audio understanding under matched settings, albeit at a proof-of-concept scale without large-scale instruction tuning, preference alignment, or practical decoding schemes. We introduce DIFFA-2, a practical diffusion-based LALM for general audio understanding. DIFFA-2 upgrades the speech encoder, employs dual semantic and acoustic adapters, and is trained with a four-stage curriculum that combines semantic and acoustic alignment, large-scale supervised fine-tuning, and variance-reduced preference optimization, using only fully open-source corpora. Experiments on MMSU, MMAU, and MMAR show that DIFFA-2 consistently improves over DIFFA and is competitive to strong AR LALMs under practical training budgets, supporting diffusion-based modeling is a viable backbone for large-scale audio understanding.

By dynamically repositioning a liquid-based radiating element within a confined physical structure, FAS can exploit spatial diversity without relying on multiple fixed antenna elements. This spatial mobility provides a new degree of freedom for mitigating channel fading and interference, while maintaining low hardware complexity and power consumption. However, the performance of FAS in realistic deployments is strongly affected by channel uncertainty, hardware nonidealities, and mechanical constraints, all of which can substantially deviate from idealized analytical assumptions. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the operation and design of FAS under such practical considerations. Key aspects include the characterization of spatio-temporal channel uncertainty, analysis of hardware and mechanical impairments such as RF nonlinearity, port coupling, and fluid response delay, as well as the exploration of robust design and learning-based control strategies to enhance system reliability. Finally, open research directions are identified, aiming to guide future developments toward robust, adaptive, and cross-domain FAS design for next-generation wireless networks."}

However, enabling streaming recognition within this framework remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a novel streaming ASR approach that integrates a read/write policy network with monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) to dynamically segment speech embeddings. These segments are interleaved with label sequences during training, enabling seamless integration with the LLM. During inference, the audio stream is buffered until the MoChA module triggers a read signal, at which point the buffered segment together with the previous token is fed into the LLM for the next token prediction. We also introduce a minimal-latency training objective to guide the policy network toward accurate segmentation boundaries. Furthermore, we adopt a joint training strategy in which a non-streaming LLM-ASR model and our streaming model share parameters. Experiments on the AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 Mandarin benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms recent streaming ASR baselines, achieving character error rates of 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively. The latency optimization results in a 62.5% reduction in average token generation delay with negligible impact on recognition accuracy"}

While conventional linear receivers can suppress spectrally separated interferers under ideal hardware assumptions, receiver saturation and finite-resolution quantization cause nonlinear spectral leakage that severely degrades performance in practical wideband radios. We study the recovery of a desired signal from nonlinear receiver observations corrupted by a high-power out-of-band interferer. The receiver front-end is modeled as a smooth, memoryless nonlinearity followed by additive noise and optional quantization. To mitigate these nonlinear and quantization-induced distortions, we propose a learned multi-layer Vector Approximate Message Passing (LMLVAMP) algorithm that incorporates spectral priors with neural network based denoising. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains over conventional methods, particularly in high-interference regimes representative of FR3 coexistence scenarios."}

To reduce the computation, this paper presents a novel method for conducting ray tracing at a coarse set of reference points and interpolating the channels at other locations. The key insight is to interpolate the images of reflected points. In addition to the computational savings, the method directly captures the spherical nature of each wavefront enabling fast and accurate computation of channels using line-of-sight MIMO and other wide aperture techniques.

To address this gap, we present EmoShift, a lightweight activation-steering framework incorporating a EmoSteer layer, which learns a steering vector for each target emotion in the output embedding space to capture its latent offset and maintain stable, appropriate expression across utterances and categories. With only 10M trainable parameters,less than 1/30 of full fine-tuning, EmoShift outperforms zero-shot and fully fine-tuned baselines in objective and subjective evaluations, enhancing emotional expressiveness while preserving naturalness and speaker similarity.

Using the Bridge2AI-Voice dataset, a multi-institutional collection of pathological voices, we systematically examine three performance-critical factors: reconstruction loss (Mean Absolute Error vs. Mean Squared Error), normalization (patch-wise vs. global), and masking (random vs. content-aware). Our optimized design, which combines Mean Absolute Error (MA-Error) loss, patch-wise normalization, and content-aware masking, achieves a Macro F1 of $0.688 \\pm 0.009$ (over 10 fine-tuning runs), outperforming a strong out-of-domain SSL baseline pre-trained on large-scale general audio, which has a Macro F1 of $0.663 \\pm 0.011$.

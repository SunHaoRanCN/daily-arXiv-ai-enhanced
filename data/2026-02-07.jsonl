To address these limitations, we propose ARCHI-TTS that features a dedicated semantic aligner to ensure robust temporal and semantic consistency between text and audio. To overcome high computational inference costs, ARCHI-TTS employs an efficient inference strategy that reuses encoder features across denoising steps, drastically accelerating synthesis without performance degradation. An auxiliary CTC loss applied to the condition encoder further enhances the semantic understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that ARCHI-TTS achieves a WER of 1.98% on LibriSpeech-PC test-clean, and 1.47%/1.42% on SeedTTS test-en/test-zh with a high inference efficiency, consistently outperforming recent state-of-the-art TTS systems."}

The proposed kernel estimator is compared in simulated experiments to the conventional method using spherical wave functions and an established physics-informed machine learning model, achieving lower interpolation error by approximately 2 dB on average within the analyzed frequencies of 100 Hz and 2.5 kHz and reconstructing the ground truth sound field more consistently within the target region."}

Specifically, we introduce a novel special token, the Speech Summarization Token (SST), for each speech interval to encapsulate the intra-interval speech information into its associated KV pairs. The SST module is trained via instruction fine-tuning, employing a curriculum learning strategy where the SST learns to compress information in a progressive manner--advancing from low-ratio (simple) to high-ratio (challenging) compression.

A key challenge here is to jointly guarantee tracking accuracy, communication reliability, and control stability within a unified framework. To address this issue, we propose an integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) framework for UAV-assisted target tracking, where the considered tracking system is modeled as a discrete-time linear control process, with the objective of driving the deviation between the UAV and target states toward zero. We formulate a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) optimization problem for joint control and beamforming design, which is highly non-convex and intractable in its original form. To overcome this difficulty, the target state is first estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, by deriving the closed-form optimal beamforming solution under a given control input, the original problem is equivalently reformulated into a tractable control-oriented form. Finally, we convexify the remaining non-convex constraints via a relaxation-based convex approximation, yielding a computationally tractable convex optimization problem that admits efficient global solution. Numerical results show that the proposed ISCC framework achieves tracking accuracy comparable to a non-causal benchmark while maintaining stable communication, and it significantly outperforms the conventional control and tracking method."}

However, accurately reconstructing both the shape and permittivity of the defects inside cylindrical structures remains challenging due to complex wave scattering phenomena and the limited accuracy of the existing signal processing and deep learning techniques. To address these issues, this study proposes a migration-assisted deep learning scheme for reconstructing the shape and permittivity of defects within cylindrical structures. The proposed scheme involves three stages of GPR data processing. First, a dual-permittivity estimation network extracts the permittivity values of the defect and the cylindrical structure, the latter of which is estimated with the help of a novel structural similarity index measure-based autofocusing technique. Second, a modified Kirchhoff migration incorporating the extracted permittivity of the cylindrical structure maps the signals reflected from the defect to the imaging domain. Third, a shape reconstruction network processes the migrated image to recover the precise shape of the defect. The image of the interior defect is finally obtained by combining the reconstructed shape and extracted permittivity of the defect. The proposed scheme is validated using both synthetic and experimental data from a laboratory trunk model and real tree trunk samples. Comparative results show superior performance over existing deep learning methods, while generalization tests on live trees confirm its feasibility for in-field deployment. The underlying principle can further be applied to other circumferential GPR imaging scenarios. The code and database are available at: https://github.com/jwqian54/Migration-Assisted-DL."}

In the proposed UCSFL framework, users deploy split sub-models locally, while complete models are maintained and updated at access point (AP)-side distributed processing units (DPUs), followed by a two-level aggregation procedure across DPUs and the central processing unit (CPU). Under standard machine learning (ML) assumptions, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for UCSFL, which reveals that the AP-cluster size is a key factor influencing model training accuracy. Motivated by this result, we introduce a new performance metric, termed the latency-to-accuracy ratio, defined as the ratio of a user's per-iteration training latency to the weighted size of its AP cluster. Based on this metric, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the maximum latency-to-accuracy ratio by jointly optimizing uplink power control, downlink beamforming, model splitting, and AP clustering. The resulting problem is decomposed into two sub-problems operating on different time scales, for which dedicated algorithms are developed to handle the short-term and long-term optimizations, respectively. Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that UCSFL effectively reduces the latency-to-accuracy ratio of the VGG16 model compared with baseline schemes. Moreover, the proposed framework adaptively adjusts splitting and clustering strategies in response to varying communication and computation resources. An MNIST-based handwritten digit classification example further shows that UCSFL significantly accelerates the convergence of the VGG16 model."}

The NN architecture captures sequences of BFF signals from different users, and through the application of learning mechanisms, subsequently estimate their trajectories. In turn, this information is employed to find the shortest path to the target, thereby enabling more efficient navigation.

Using the sparsity of propagating normal modes and the orthogonality of mode depth functions, OCMS-D estimates the normal mode parameters under a fixed source-array distance at first. The estimated normal mode parameters are then used to estimate the source depth. To ensure the precision of the source depth estimation, the method utilizes information on both the amplitude distribution and the sign (positive/negative) patterns of the estimated mode depth functions at the inferred source depth. Numerical simulations evaluate the performance of OCMS-D under different conditions. The effectiveness of OCMS-D is also verified by the Yellow Sea experiment and the SWellEx-96 experiment.

Such systematic errors typically arise from sensor mis-calibration, including uncertainties in sensor positions and response characteristics, leading to measurement-induced phase shifts in plane wave coefficients. Traditional methods often result in biased estimates or non-convex solutions. To overcome these issues, we propose an optimal transport (OT) framework. This framework operates on a set of lifted non-negative measures that correspond to observation-dependent shifted coefficients relative to the unperturbed ones. By applying OT, the supports of the measures are transported toward an optimal average in the phase space, effectively morphing them into an indistinguishable state. This optimal average, known as barycenter, is linked to the estimated plane-wave coefficients using the same lifting rule. The framework addresses the ill-posed nature of the problem, due to the large number of plane waves, by adding a constant to the ground cost, ensuring the sparsity of the transport matrix. Convex consistency of the solution is maintained. Simulation results confirm that our proposed method provides more accurate coefficient estimations compared to baseline approaches in scenarios with both additive noise and phase perturbations."}

The proposed low-rank tensor completion (TC) method builds on the conventional nuclear norm (NN) minimization-based low-rank TC paradigm, through the addition of a discrete-aware regularizer, which enforces discreteness in the objective of the problem, by an $\\ell_0$-norm regularizer that is approximated by a continuous and differentiable function normalized via fractional programming (FP) under a proximal gradient (PG) framework, in order to solve the proposed problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the new method both in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and convergence, compared to the conventional state of-the-art (SotA) techniques, including NN minimization approaches, as well as a mixture of the latter with a matrix factorization approach."}

This paper proposes Intensity- and Distance-Aware Statistical Outlier Removal (IDSOR), a range-adaptive filtering method that jointly exploits intensity cues and neighborhood sparsity. By incorporating an empirical, range-dependent distribution of weather returns into the threshold design, IDSOR suppresses weather-induced points while preserving fine structural details without cumbersome manual parameter tuning. We also propose a variant that uses a previously proposed method to estimate the weather return distribution from data, and integrates it into IDSOR. Experiments on simulation-augmented level-crossing measurements and on the Winter Adverse Driving dataset (WADS) demonstrate that IDSOR achieves a favorable precision-recall trade-off, maintaining both precision and recall above 90% on WADS."}

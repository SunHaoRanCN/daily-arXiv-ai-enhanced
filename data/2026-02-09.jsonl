However, the original study did not include explicit generalization tests to assess how well the NN would perform on previously unseen data, which prevented a comprehensive evaluation of the model's robustness and applicability in diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we conducted additional generalization assessments, the results of which are presented in this case study. These results serve both to complement and to refine the original analysis reported in [1]. Most importantly, the overall conclusions of the initial study remain valid: the NN is still able to reduce the PAPR level to a desired reference value, also with a lower computational cost, confirming the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed method across a more generalized setting."}

Furthermore, random blockages induce spatial non-stationarity across the RIS array, causing signals from different scatterers to illuminate only partial regions, referred to as visible regions (VRs). This renders conventional far-field and fully visible array-based channel models inadequate and makes channel estimation particularly challenging. In this paper, we investigate the non-stationary cascaded channel estimation problem in a hybrid-field propagation environment, where the RIS-base station (BS) link operates in the far-field, while the user-RIS link exhibits near-field characteristics with partial visibility. To address the resulting high-dimensional and coupled estimation problem, a reduced-dimensional sparse bilinear representation is developed by exploiting the structural characteristics of the cascaded channel. In particular, a dictionary compression technique is proposed to represent the high-dimensional coupled dictionary using a low-dimensional polar-domain dictionary weighted by a visibility matrix, thereby significantly reducing the problem scale. Based on this representation, a turbo-structured joint Bayesian estimation (TS-JBE) approach is proposed to simultaneously estimate the channel gains, VRs, and off-grid parameters, thereby avoiding error propagation inherent in existing sequential methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the estimation accuracy compared with existing approaches."}

Pulsar satellites broadcast dedicated signals optimized for commercial users. This brings rapid geometry change, strong Doppler observability, and robust timing, enabling new approaches to positioning even when only one satellite is visible. Internet of Things (IoT) applications often prioritize availability over sub-meter accuracy in urban canyons, semi-indoor spaces, and other constrained environments. Many platforms are battery-powered, have strict size, weight, and power (SWaP) limits, and cannot support complex multi-sensor architectures. Leveraging LEO dynamics and signal strength, Pulsar can maintain navigation capability under these conditions without specialized user hardware.\n  Here we present a single-satellite positioning (SSP) concept that uses available Pulsar measurements to estimate user position and receiver clock states without external aiding. Early in Pulsar deployment, only one or two satellites may be in view, yet this still benefits stationary or near-stationary users, including in semi-indoor and indoor settings. We discuss algorithmic details and system implications: SSP enables positioning with minimal satellite visibility, reduces reliance on dense constellations, and supports integration into resource-constrained platforms. We present simulation and live sky results. High-fidelity constellation simulations configured for Pulsar provide controlled performance assessment. We also present early findings from a Pulsar-enabled receiver using observations from the Pulsar-0 satellite on orbit. Preliminary tests demonstrate meter-level accuracy outdoors and indoors, highlighting potential under varied reception conditions."}

Traditional codecs preserve acoustic details well but lack semantic information. Recent hybrid codecs attempt to incorporate semantic information through distillation, but this often degrades reconstruction performance, making it difficult to achieve both. To address this limitation, we introduce STACodec, a unified codec that integrates semantic information from self-supervised learning (SSL) models into the first layer of residual vector quantization (RVQ-1) via semantic token assignment (STA). To further eliminate reliance on SSL-based semantic tokenizers and improve efficiency during inference, we propose a semantic pre-distillation (SPD) module, which predicts semantic tokens directly for assignment to the first RVQ layer during inference. Experimental results show that STACodec outperforms existing hybrid codecs in both audio reconstruction and downstream semantic tasks, demonstrating a better balance between acoustic fidelity and semantic capability."}

We offer a guide to implement a receiver capable of capturing broadband downlink Ku-band signals from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites (e.g., Starlink and OneWeb) and estimating the recurring symbols for SOP measurements. The methodology integrates recent approaches in the literature, highlighting the most effective aspects while guiding the replication of experiments even under limitations on the front-end gain and bandwidth. Using the proposed model, we can identify recurring symbols transmitted by Starlink satellites, which are then used to collect Doppler shift measurements over a 600 s interval. A position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution is also computed via least squares (LS), which achieves a positioning error of approximately 268 m after a post-fit refinement."}

The proposed LM losses build upon language models pretrained to associate speech with text. When ground-truth transcripts are unavailable, we propose to modify a popular automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, Whisper, to compare the decoded utterance against the ASR-inferred transcriptions of the input speech. Else, we propose to use the timed-text regularizer (TTR) to compare WavLM representations of the decoded utterance against BERT representations of the ground-truth transcriptions. We test and compare LM losses against an SD objective, using a reference codec whose three-stage training regimen was designed after several popular codecs.

Our findings reveal that while certain EMG channels are individually more informative, the highest performance arises from subsets that leverage complementary relationships among channels. We also analyzed phoneme classification accuracy under channel ablations and observed interpretable patterns reflecting the anatomical roles of the underlying muscles. To address performance degradation from channel reduction, we pretrained models on full 8-channel data using random channel dropout and fine-tuned them on reduced-channel subsets. Fine-tuning consistently outperformed training from scratch for 4 - 6 channel settings, with the best dropout strategy depending on the number of channels. These results suggest that performance degradation from sensor reduction can be mitigated through pretraining and channel-aware design, supporting the development of lightweight and practical EMG-based silent speech systems."}

Therefore, the proposed channel model includes non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, including the ones created by the MF-RIS. We also performed an experimental evaluation of the channel throughput in a fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) single user multiple-input-multiple-output (SU-MIMO) system, reporting a 74\\% reduction in throughput variance and a 12.5\\% sum-rate improvement within the MF-RIS near-field compared to the no-RIS setup.

A conventional time-domain approach relies on computing the Wiener interpolation filter to estimate and suppress the jamming waveform from the received samples. It is widely acknowledged that this method is effective for protecting wideband systems against narrowband interference. In this work, this paradigm is questioned through the design of a $K$-tone jamming waveform that is intrinsically difficult to estimate assuming a $L$-tap Wiener interpolation filter. This design relies on an optimization procedure that maximizes the analytical Bayesian mean squared error associated with the jamming waveform estimate. Additionally, an analytical proof is provided showing that a multi-tone jamming waveform composed of $L/2+1$ tones is sufficient to render the Wiener-filter-based anti-jamming module completely ineffective. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations assuming both perfect knowledge and practical estimates of the correlation functions of the received signal."}

However, generating realistic spatial audio, such as first-order ambisonics (FOA), from 360-degree videos in complex acoustic scenes remains challenging. Existing methods often overlook the dynamic nature and acoustic complexity of 360-degree scenes, fail to fully account for dynamic sound sources, and neglect complex environmental effects such as occlusion, reflections, and reverberation, which are influenced by scene geometries and materials. We propose DynFOA, a framework based on dynamic acoustic perception and conditional diffusion, for generating high-fidelity FOA from 360-degree videos. DynFOA first performs visual processing via a video encoder, which detects and localizes multiple dynamic sound sources, estimates their depth and semantics, and reconstructs the scene geometry and materials using a 3D Gaussian Splatting. This reconstruction technique accurately models occlusion, reflections, and reverberation based on the geometries and materials of the reconstructed 3D scene and the listener's viewpoint. The audio encoder then captures the spatial motion and temporal 4D sound source trajectories to fine-tune the diffusion-based FOA generator. The fine-tuned FOA generator adjusts spatial cues in real time, ensuring consistent directional fidelity during listener head rotation and complex environmental changes. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DynFOA consistently outperforms existing methods across metrics such as spatial accuracy, acoustic fidelity, and distribution matching, while also improving the user experience. Therefore, DynFOA provides a robust and scalable approach to rendering realistic dynamic spatial audio for VR and immersive media applications."}

We propose Speech Diffusion Tokenizer (SiTok), a diffusion autoencoder that jointly learns semantic-rich representations through supervised learning and enables high-fidelity audio reconstruction with diffusion. We scale SiTok to 1.6B parameters and train it on 2 million hours of speech. Experiments show that SiTok outperforms strong baselines on understanding, reconstruction and generation tasks, at an extremely low token rate of $12.5$ Hz and a bit-rate of 200 bits-per-second."}

While detection methods have emerged, they are typically designed and validated in music streaming contexts with clean, full-length tracks. Broadcast audio, however, poses a different challenge: music appears as short excerpts, often masked by dominant speech, conditions under which existing detectors fail. In this work, we introduce AI-OpenBMAT, the first dataset tailored to broadcast-style AI-music detection. It contains 3,294 one-minute audio excerpts (54.9 hours) that follow the duration patterns and loudness relations of real television audio, combining human-made production music with stylistically matched continuations generated with Suno v3.5. We benchmark a CNN baseline and state-of-the-art SpectTTTra models to assess SNR and duration robustness, and evaluate on a full broadcast scenario. Across all settings, models that excel in streaming scenarios suffer substantial degradation, with F1-scores dropping below 60% when music is in the background or has a short duration. These results highlight speech masking and short music length as critical open challenges for AI music detection, and position AI-OpenBMAT as a benchmark for developing detectors capable of meeting industrial broadcast requirements."}

### [1] [A Gradient Boosted Mixed-Model Machine Learning Framework for Vessel Speed in the U.S. Arctic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12292)
*Mauli Pant,Linda Fernandez,Indranil Sahoo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 使用两阶段机器学习框架分析北极船舶速度：第一阶段预测速度大于零的概率，第二阶段预测正速度值。研究发现海岸距离和水深是主要影响因素，风和海冰影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解环境和操作条件如何影响船舶速度对北极航行条件表征至关重要。传统方法将零速度和正速度作为单一连续过程处理会掩盖重要模式。

Method: 采用两阶段机器学习框架：1) 使用梯度提升决策树建模速度大于零的概率；2) 建模正速度条件分布。整合AIS数据与海冰浓度、航向、风、水深、海岸距离、船舶类型和航行状态等变量，使用SHAP值量化协变量效应。

Result: 正速度分类器达到强区分能力(AUC=0.85)，条件速度模型解释约77%的样本外方差。海岸距离和水深是船舶速度可能性和大小的主要决定因素，航向、船舶类型和航行状态引入次要变化，风和海冰影响相对较小。

Conclusion: 研究结果实证表征了北极船舶运行机制，为速度管理和航道级评估提供依据。两阶段建模方法能更好捕捉零速度和正速度的不同模式。

Abstract: Understanding how environmental and operational conditions influence vessel speed is crucial for characterizing navigational conditions in the Arctic. We analyzed Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from 2010-2019 to examine vessel speed over ground (SOG). Over half of the AIS records showed zero SOG, and treating zero and positive SOG as a single continuous process can obscure important patterns. We therefore applied a two-stage machine learning framework, first modeling the probability of SOG greater than zero and then modeling SOG conditional on being positive. AIS observations were integrated with sea ice concentration, course over ground, wind, bathymetric depth, distance to coast, vessel group, and navigational status. Gradient boosted decision trees with random effects captured nonlinear environmental responses while accounting for repeated observations. The positive SOG classifier achieved strong discrimination (AUC = 0.85), while the conditional speed model explained approximately 77 percent of out-of-fold variance. SHAP values quantified covariate effects by decomposing model predictions into additive contributions from individual variables. Distance to coast and bathymetric depth were dominant determinants of both the likelihood and magnitude of vessel speed, while changes in course, vessel group, and navigational status introduced secondary variation. Wind and sea ice effects were modest. Together, these results empirically characterize Arctic vessel operating regimes relevant to speed management and corridor-level assessment.

### [2] [Interference-Robust Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Computation for Decentralized Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12426)
*Nicolò Michelusi*

Main category: eess.SP

Motivation: NCOTA计算虽然具有低延迟和带宽效率高的优点，但容易受到外部干扰的影响，这会偏置共识估计并恶化去中心化优化算法的收敛性能。

Method: 提出IR-NCOTA方案，核心思想是在所有节点间协调随机旋转参考系，并传输伪随机导频信号，将外部干扰转化为相对于旋转参考系的零均值圆对称分布。

Result: 在分类任务的数值结果中，IR-NCOTA在存在外部干扰的情况下表现出优于基线NCOTA算法的性能。

Conclusion: IR-NCOTA方案能够有效抵抗外部干扰，保持共识估计的无偏性，从而保留了底层优化算法的收敛保证。

Abstract: Non-coherent over-the-air (NCOTA) computation enables low-latency and bandwidth-efficient decentralized optimization by exploiting the average energy superposition property of wireless channels. It has recently been proposed as a powerful tool for executing consensus-based optimization algorithms in fully decentralized systems. A key advantage of NCOTA is that it enables unbiased consensus estimation without channel state information at either transmitters or receivers, requires no transmission scheduling, and scales efficiently to dense network deployments. However, NCOTA is inherently susceptible to external interference, which can bias the consensus estimate and deteriorate the convergence of the underlying decentralized optimization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel interference-robust (IR-)NCOTA scheme. The core idea is to apply a coordinated random rotation of the frame of reference across all nodes, and transmit a pseudo-random pilot signal, allowing to transform external interference into a circularly symmetric distribution with zero mean relative to the rotated frame. This ensures that the consensus estimates remain unbiased, preserving the convergence guarantees of the underlying optimization algorithm. Through numerical results on a classification task, it is demonstrated that IR-NCOTA exhibits superior performance over the baseline NCOTA algorithm in the presence of external interference.

### [3] [Practical RIS Gain without the Pain: Randomization and Opportunistic Scheduling in 5G NR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12437)
*L. Yashvanth,Raju Malleboina,Venkatareddy Akumalla,Nekkanti Guna Sai Kiran,Debdeep Sarkar,Chandra R. Murthy*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 实验证明，在5G NR系统中集成可重构智能表面（RIS）能显著提升性能，即使随机配置RIS相位，结合5G NR的比例公平调度机制也能实现接近最优的吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在真实5G NR系统中集成RIS的实际性能增益，探索低开销的RIS配置方案，验证随机RIS配置在实际系统中的有效性。

Method: 使用OpenAirInterface框架搭建实时5G NR系统，集成自建RIS。首先量化RIS带来的吞吐量增益，然后测试随机RIS相位配置结合5G NR比例公平调度机制的性能，评估RSRP、BLER、MCS指数和吞吐量等关键指标。

Result: 实验表明：1) RIS集成显著提升5G系统吞吐量；2) 随机RIS配置结合比例公平调度可实现接近最优的吞吐量，因为调度器会优先服务信道条件最好的用户；3) 随机配置的RIS性能与优化设计相当，且开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 在实际5G NR系统中，即使采用随机配置的RIS也能提供与优化设计相当的性能，这为低开销RIS部署提供了实用方案，证明了RIS在实际系统中的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the performance gains achieved by an in-house built reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) integrated with a real-time 5G new radio (NR) system implemented using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework. We first quantify the gain in throughput achievable by integrating an RIS with a 5G system. Next, we show that randomly setting the RIS phase configuration and leveraging the inherent proportional fair (PF) scheduling mechanism of 5G NR can yield near-optimal throughput, provided the throughput averaging window of the PF scheduler is chosen judiciously. This occurs because, in each time slot, the PF scheduler naturally prioritizes data transmission to the user equipment (UE) that experiences the best channel conditions, namely, the UE to which the randomly configured RIS is aligned. Subsequently, we experimentally evaluate key performance metrics, including the reference signal received power (RSRP), block error rate (BLER), modulation and coding scheme (MCS) index, and throughput, under random RIS configurations. These results confirm that even a randomly configured RIS with negligible overhead can deliver performance comparable to optimized RIS designs, in real-world 5G NR wireless communication systems.

### [4] [Task- and Metric-Specific Signal Quality Indices for Medical Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12478)
*Jad Haidamous,Christoph Hoog Antink*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扰动的信号质量指数(pSQI)，将信号质量定义为任务和度量依赖的概念，通过添加有色高斯噪声扰动来检测算法性能下降，无需训练即可识别不可靠输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗时间序列信号(如ECG、PPG)常受测量伪影影响，而现有信号质量指数大多与任务无关，不考虑下游具体算法和性能指标，无法有效识别算法可能产生不可靠输出的信号段。

Method: 提出扰动式信号质量指数(pSQI)，定义为在加性有色高斯噪声扰动下性能指标的最坏情况值，该噪声具有下限信噪比。引入任务和度量特定SQI的形式化要求，包括度量的期望单调性和阈值化下的最大分离性。

Result: 在R波峰检测和房颤分类基准测试中，pSQI在识别不可靠输入方面始终优于现有的基于特征和深度学习的SQI，且无需训练。

Conclusion: 信号质量应定义为任务和度量依赖的概念，pSQI提供了一种无需训练的方法来检测算法性能下降，优于现有方法，有助于提高医疗时间序列分析的可靠性。

Abstract: Medical time series such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and photoplethysmograms (PPGs) are frequently affected by measurement artifacts due to challenging acquisition environments, such as in ambulances and during routine daily activities. Since automated algorithms for analyzing such signals increasingly inform clinically relevant decisions, identifying signal segments on which these algorithms may produce unreliable outputs is of critical importance. Signal quality indices (SQIs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, most existing SQIs are task agnostic and do not account for the specific algorithm and performance metric used downstream. In this work, we formalize signal quality as a task- and metric-dependent concept and propose a perturbation-based SQI (pSQI) that aims to detect an algorithm's performance degradation on an input signal with respect to a metric. The pSQI is defined as the worst-case value of the performance metric under an additive, colored Gaussian noise perturbation with a lower-bounded signal-to-noise ratio. We introduce formal requirements for task- and metric-specific SQIs, including monotonicity of the metric in expectation and maximal separation under thresholding. Experiments on R-peak detection and atrial fibrillation classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed pSQI consistently outperforms existing feature- and deep learning-based SQIs in identifying unreliable inputs without requiring training.

### [5] [Generative Site-Specific Beamforming via Information-Maximizing Codebook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12552)
*Cheng-Jie Zhao,Zhaolin Wang,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出GenSSBF框架，通过SIM码本和CFM生成模型，利用少量RSRP反馈生成高质量波束，接近最大比传输性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统波束赋形需要大量信道状态信息反馈，开销大。本文旨在通过少量参考信号接收功率反馈，利用站点特定环境信息生成高质量通信波束

Method: 1. 设计SIM码本最大化RSRP反馈与站点特定信道的互信息，减少初始波束扫描开销；2. 开发基于CFM的生成模型，将RSRP反馈作为条件先验，捕获波束生成不确定性；3. 生成少量UE特定候选波束，由UE选择最终数据传输波束

Conclusion: GenSSBF框架通过集成SIM码本和CFM生成模型，有效利用站点特定环境信息，以少量反馈实现高质量波束生成，为大规模MIMO系统提供高效波束赋形方案

Abstract: A novel generative site-specific beamforming (GenSSBF) framework is proposed, which integrates a site-information-maximizing (SIM) codebook with a conditional flow matching (CFM)-based beam generator. By this framework, the site-specific radio propagation environment is learned at the base station (BS), enabling the generation of high fidelity communication beams from coarse reference-signal-received-power (RSRP) feedback provided by user equipments (UEs). In the proposed design, a low-dimensional SIM probing codebook is first constructed by maximizing the mutual information between the RSRP feedback and the site-specific channel. This design not only reduces the initial beam sweeping overhead, but also enhances the amount of channel state information conveyed through UE feedback. By treating the RSRP feedback as a conditional prior, a CFM-based generative model is further developed to explicitly capture the uncertainty in beam generation. Specifically, a small set of UE-specific candidate beams is generated by inferring the learned generative model and sampling from the corresponding posterior distribution, after which the final data transmission beam is selected by the UE. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed SIM codebook and the CFM-based beam generator. The proposed GenSSBF framework achieves beamforming performance nearly identical to maximum ratio transmission while requiring only eight probing beams and eight candidate beams.

Motivation: 随着铁路运输向更高自动化发展（如R2DATO项目），GNSS在列车自动运行等安全关键应用中变得至关重要。然而，GNSS信号完整性受到有意和无意的射频干扰威胁，特别是干扰和欺骗攻击，这对铁路安全构成严重风险。

Abstract: As rail transport moves toward higher degrees of automation under initiatives like the R2DATO project [1], accurate and reliable train localization has become essential. Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) is considered as a main technology in enabling operational advancements including Automatic Train Operation (ATO), moving block signaling, and virtual coupling, which are the core components of the Horizon Europe 2024 rail digitalization agenda. However, GNSS signal integrity is increasingly threatened by intentional and unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI). This include jamming and spoofing, which are particularly concerning as the broadcasted signal can deliberately disrupt or manipulate the GNSS signal. - Jamming refers to an intentional form of interference that induces disturbances in the GNSS band, causing performance degradation or can even entirely block the receiver from acquiring the satellite signals. - Spoofing involves broadcasting counterfeit satellite signals to deceive the GNSS receiver, leading to inaccurate estimation of position, navigation and timing information. This concern about interference is not unique to rail applications. The aeronautical sector has long recognized the risks posed by GNSS interference, with extensive documentation on its impact on navigation, landing procedures, and surveillance systems. In recent years, awareness of these risks has expanded to other transport sectors. Within the automotive industry, particularly in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), several studies [2][3][4] have addressed the vulnerability of GNSS against interference. Similar concerns are now emerging in the rail domain [5][6][7], especially as GNSS is increasingly adopted in safety-critical applications. In literature, several levels of actions have been explored, ranging from merely the detection of a malicious signal at the initial phase to the application of advanced signal processing methods aimed at suppressing the effects of interference [8]. In alignment with the goal of the R2DATO project, we evaluated the impact of various classes of interference signals such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), pulsed, frequency hopping and chirp signals on the GNSS observables including Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and Carrier to Noise Ratio (CNO) as measured by a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS). However, in this work, the analysis is only limited to impact of chirp interference on GPS L1 receiver observables and detection performance.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a key enabler for next-generation wireless networks, offering programmable control over propagation environments. While extensive research focuses on planar RIS architectures, practical deployments often involve non-planar surfaces, such as structural columns or curved facades, where standard planar beamforming models fail. Moreover, existing analytical solutions for curved RISs are often restricted to specific, pre-defined array manifold geometries. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel deep learning (DL) framework for optimizing the phase shifts of non-planar RISs. We first introduce a low-dimensional parametric model to capture arbitrary surface curvature effectively. Based on this, we design a neural network (NN) that utilizes a sparse set of received power measurements to estimate the surface geometry and derive the optimal phase configuration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges fast and significantly outperforms conventional planar beamforming designs, validating its robustness against arbitrary surface curvature. We also analyze the impact of the measurement location error on the algorithm's performance.

### [8] [Comparison of OTFS and OFDM for RIS-aided Systems in the Presence of Phase Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12804)
*Stephen McWade,Arman Farhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了RIS辅助的OTFS和OFDM系统在相位噪声下的性能，提出了基于维纳滤波的联合RIS信道和相位噪声估计方法，证明了RIS辅助OTFS在相位噪声环境下优于RIS辅助OFDM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM对相位噪声敏感，可能限制RIS系统的潜在增益。OTFS对时变信道具有鲁棒性，可能是RIS辅助系统中相位噪声下的理想波形选择，但现有文献尚未充分分析相位噪声对OTFS的影响，也没有考虑相位噪声对RIS辅助OTFS系统的影响。

Method: 提出了一种基于维纳滤波的联合RIS信道和相位噪声估计技术，该方法利用RIS设置中相位噪声和多普勒扩展信道的统计特性。

Result: 数值分析表明，在相位噪声存在的情况下，RIS辅助OTFS相比RIS辅助OFDM具有显著增益。提出的估计方法在误码率方面比现有方法有高达3dB的增益。

Conclusion: RIS辅助OTFS在相位噪声环境下优于RIS辅助OFDM，提出的联合估计方法能有效提升系统性能，为RIS辅助通信系统在相位噪声条件下的设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of RIS-aided orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in the presence of oscillator phase noise. OFDM is known to be sensitive to phase noise, which could limit the potential gains promised by RIS systems. OTFS, on the other hand, is a compelling potential waveform for RIS-aided systems in the presence of phase noise due to it's resilience to time-varying channels. However, the effect of phase noise on OTFS has not been fully analyzed in the literature as of yet. Additionally, no existing works in the literature consider the effect of phase noise on an RIS-aided OTFS system. Hence, we propose a joint RIS channel and phase noise estimation technique using a Wiener filtering approach. Our proposed method exploits the statistical nature of both the phase noise and the Doppler spread channel in a setup with RIS. Our numerical analysis demonstrates the significant gain of RIS-aided OTFS offers compared to RIS-aided OFDM in the presence in the presence of phase noise. Additionally, our results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed estimation technique, with gains of up to 3~dB in terms of bit error rate (BER), over existing methods in the literature.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks at upper mid-band and millimeter-wave frequencies require accurate site-specific deterministic channel propagation prediction. Wireless ray tracing (RT) provides site-specific predictions but demands high-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) environment models with material properties. Manual 3D model reconstruction achieves high accuracy but requires weeks of expert effort, creating scalability bottlenecks for large environment reconstruction. Traditional vision-based 3D reconstruction methods lack RT compatibility due to geometrically defective meshes and missing material properties. This paper presents Holistic Reconstruction with Automated Material Assignment (HoRAMA) for wireless propagation prediction using NYURay. HoRAMA generates RT-compatible 3D models from RGB video readily captured using a smartphone or low-cost portable camera, by integrating MASt3R-SLAM dense point cloud generation with vision language model-assisted material assignment. The HoRAMA 3D reconstruction method is verified by comparing NYURay RT predictions, using both manually created and HoRAMA-generated 3D models, against field measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz across 12 TX-RX locations in a 700 square meter factory. HoRAMA ray tracing predictions achieve a 2.28 dB RMSE for matched multipath component (MPC) power predictions, comparable to the manually created 3D model baseline (2.18 dB), while reducing 3D reconstruction time from two months to 16 hours. HoRAMA enables scalable wireless digital twin creation for RT network planning, infrastructure deployment, and beam management in 5G/6G systems, as well as eventual real-time implementation at the edge.

Abstract: We investigate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for the task of position and velocity estimation in non-LOS (NLOS) indoor scenarios, using a snapshot based multi-step estimation algorithm. We evaluate a compound RIS structure prototype composed of four RIS tiles with 1-bit phase control per RIS unit cell. Numerical simulation results taking the antenna patterns into account are presented for an 3 m x 3 m area of interest. We demonstrate that the initial grid search step using the far field assumption is not robust enough for small distances to the RIS center and propose a more robust algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the effect of the antenna pattern causes an increased position and velocity error. Our modified three-step algorithm achieves a position error of 7 mm and a velocity error of 0.12 m/s at a distance of 2 m to the RIS center under a realistic numerical propagation model.

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight sensing of human activities in complex environments is enabled by multiple-input multiple-output through-the-wall radar (TWR). However, the distinctiveness of micro-Doppler signature between similar indoor human activities such as gun carrying and normal walking is minimal, while the large scale of input images required for effective identification utilizing time-frequency spectrograms creates challenges for model training and inference efficiency. To address this issue, the Chebyshev-time map is proposed in this paper, which is a method characterizing micro-Doppler signature using polynomial orders. The parametric kinematic models for human motion and the TWR echo model are first established. Then, a time-frequency feature representation method based on orthogonal Chebyshev polynomial decomposition is proposed. The kinematic envelopes of the torso and limbs are extracted, and the time-frequency spectrum slices are mapped into a robust Chebyshev-time coefficient space, preserving the multi-order morphological detail information of time-frequency spectrum. Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which demonstrates the capability to characterize armed and unarmed indoor human activities while effectively compressing the scale of the time-frequency spectrum to achieve a balance between recognition accuracy and input data dimensions.

Abstract: The spherical nature of the wavefronts exhibited in the near-field of antenna arrays enables advanced beamforming capabilities, such as beampointing and beamnulling. In this paper, we exploit these properties to design a near-field beam pattern under a low exposure region constraint. We address the continuous region constraint through spatial discretization, which results in a large number of constraints that lead to prohibitive computational complexity. We propose a novel low-complexity algorithm that enables a computationally tractable beam pattern design. It uses a low-dimensional subspace representation of the low exposure region based on a singular value decomposition. Our approach achieves low complexity while providing a power received at a target user close to the optimal achievable power, yet with uniform power mitigation over the low exposure region.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索三维分布的大型智能表面在近场聚焦中的性能，特别是当焦点位于辐射近场时，如何在不同功率约束下优化电流分布，并分析频率和极化对聚焦性能的影响。

Method: 方法包括：1）在三维走廊空间中分布LIS元素；2）制定全局和局部功率约束下的优化问题；3）分析连续孔径的最优电流分布；4）使用赫兹偶极子阵列的离散孔径进行验证；5）结合解析结果和全波仿真进行研究。

Result: 结果显示：在全局约束下，最优电流幅度分布匹配时间反转解；在局部约束主导时，匹配共轭相位解；当两种约束都活跃时，靠近照明场的元素获得更大的激励幅度。该行为在固定尺寸LIS中不随频率和极化变化。共轭相位法下特定极化产生相同的横向和纵向分辨率，而时间反转法下这些量在不同极化间可能不同。

Conclusion: 结论表明三维LIS在近场聚焦中具有稳定的性能，最优电流分布特性在不同功率约束下呈现规律性变化，且这些特性在频率和极化方面保持不变，为实际离散孔径设计提供了理论指导。

Specifically, the LIS elements are distributed in 3D space within a long corridor, rather than being confined to a single planar aperture, and the focal point is located at a prescribed position in the radiating near field. By formulating optimization problems under both local and global power constraints, we obtain the corresponding optima. For continuous apertures, the optimal current magnitude distribution matches time-reversal (TR) solution under the global constraint and conjugate-phase (CP) solution when the local constraint dominates. When both constraints are active, the solution assigns larger excitation magnitudes to elements closer to the illumination field. This behavior remains invariant with respect to frequency and polarization for a fixed-size LIS. These findings are consistent to the more practical case of using discretized apertures in the form of Hertzian dipole arrays, studied using both analytical results and full-wave simulation. In addition, with the CP method, specific polarizations lead to identical transverse and longitudinal resolution, in contrast, under the TR method, these quantities can differ across polarizations.

Abstract: Room acoustics analysis plays a central role in architectural design, audio engineering, speech intelligibility assessment, and hearing research. Despite the availability of standardized metrics such as reverberation time, clarity, and speech transmission index, accessible tools that combine rigorous signal processing with intuitive visualization remain scarce. This paper presents AcoustiVision Pro, an open-source web-based platform for comprehensive room impulse response (RIR) analysis. The system computes twelve distinct acoustic parameters from uploaded or dataset-sourced RIRs, provides interactive 3D visualizations of early reflections, generates frequency-dependent decay characteristics through waterfall plots, and checks compliance against international standards including ANSI S12.60 and ISO 3382. We introduce the accompanying RIRMega and RIRMega Speech datasets hosted on Hugging Face, containing thousands of simulated room impulse responses with full metadata. The platform supports real-time auralization through FFT-based convolution, exports detailed PDF reports suitable for engineering documentation, and provides CSV data export for further analysis. We describe the mathematical foundations underlying each acoustic metric, detail the system architecture, and present preliminary case studies demonstrating the platform's utility across diverse application domains including classroom acoustics, healthcare facility design, and recording studio evaluation.

### [15] [Decoder-only Conformer with Modality-aware Sparse Mixtures of Experts for ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12546)
*Jaeyoung Lee,Masato Mimura*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出一种仅解码器的Conformer ASR模型，通过模态感知稀疏专家混合（MoE）同时处理语音和文本，无需外部语音编码器或预训练大语言模型，在更少参数下超越传统AED基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统通常需要单独的语音编码器和文本解码器，或依赖预训练大语言模型。本文旨在开发一个统一架构，仅使用解码器同时处理语音和文本，减少模型复杂度和参数数量。

Method: 采用仅解码器的Conformer架构，包含模态感知稀疏MoE：语音和文本使用分离的专家池，硬路由和top-1选择。混合因果性Conformer块（语音双向，文本因果）。训练结合语音位置的CTC损失和文本生成的标签平滑交叉熵损失。

Result: 113M参数模型在Librispeech上优于139M AED基线（test-clean: 2.8% vs 3.2%；test-other: 5.6% vs 6.0%）。在Common Voice 16.1多语言任务中，平均WER从12.2%降至10.6%。这是首个随机初始化的仅解码器ASR超越强AED基线。

Conclusion: 模态感知稀疏MoE和混合因果性设计使仅解码器ASR架构成为可能，在更少激活参数下实现更好性能，无需对齐/适配模块，为统一语音-文本处理提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present a decoder-only Conformer for automatic speech recognition (ASR) that processes speech and text in a single stack without external speech encoders or pretrained large language models (LLM). The model uses a modality-aware sparse mixture of experts (MoE): disjoint expert pools for speech and text with hard routing and top-1 selection, embedded in hybrid-causality Conformer blocks (bidirectional for speech, causal for text). Training combines CTC on speech positions with label-smoothed cross-entropy for text generation. Our 113M-parameter model consistently improves WER over a 139M AED baseline on Librispeech (2.8% vs. 3.2% test-clean; 5.6% vs. 6.0% test-other). On Common Voice 16.1 with a single multilingual model across five languages, our approach reduces average WER from 12.2% to 10.6%. To our knowledge, this is the first randomly initialized decoder-only ASR that surpasses strong AED baselines via modality-aware routing and sparse MoE, achieving better accuracy with fewer active parameters and without alignment/adaptation modules.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出结合循环平稳性预处理与轻量级DNN的语音增强框架，在低信噪比下有效抑制谐波噪声


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在低信噪比下抑制噪声效果不佳，特别是对于谐波噪声占主导的场景，需要更有效的解决方案

Method: 使用循环最小功率无失真响应(cMPDR)谱波束形成器作为预处理模块，利用循环平稳噪声的谱相关性抑制谐波成分，然后结合轻量级卷积循环神经网络(CRNN)或超低复杂度网络(ULCNet)进行增强

Result: 在合成数据和真实旋转机械噪声数据上，相比端到端DNN基线有显著改进，特别是在低信噪比下；参数高效的CRNN结合cMPDR预处理甚至超越了更大ULCNet在原始或维纳滤波输入上的性能

Conclusion: 明确结合循环平稳性作为信号先验比单纯增加模型容量更有效地抑制谐波干扰，为低信噪比语音增强提供了有效框架

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often struggle to suppress noise at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This paper addresses speech enhancement in scenarios dominated by harmonic noise and proposes a framework that integrates cyclostationarity-aware preprocessing with lightweight DNN-based denoising. A cyclic minimum power distortionless response (cMPDR) spectral beamformer is used as a preprocessing block. It exploits the spectral correlations of cyclostationary noise to suppress harmonic components prior to learning-based enhancement and does not require modifications to the DNN architecture. The proposed pipeline is evaluated in a single-channel setting using two DNN architectures: a simple and lightweight convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), and a state-of-the-art model, namely ultra-low complexity network (ULCNet). Experiments on synthetic data and real-world recordings dominated by rotating machinery noise demonstrate consistent improvements over end-to-end DNN baselines, particularly at low SNRs. Remarkably, a parameter-efficient CRNN with cMPDR preprocessing surpasses the performance of the larger ULCNet operating on raw or Wiener-filtered inputs. These results indicate that explicitly incorporating cyclostationarity as a signal prior is more effective than increasing model capacity alone for suppressing harmonic interference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音乐描述符数据集很少考虑用户意图，而理解用户意图对于有效满足其音乐需求至关重要。

Method: 构建了MusicRecoIntent数据集，手动标注了2,291个Reddit音乐请求，将音乐描述符分为七个类别，并标注其偏好角色（正面、负面或参考性）。然后评估了大型语言模型提取这些描述符的可靠性。

Result: LLM能够捕捉显式描述符，但在处理上下文相关的描述符时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该工作可作为细粒度用户意图建模的基准，并为改进基于LLM的音乐理解系统提供见解。

Abstract: Although annotated music descriptor datasets for user queries are increasingly common, few consider the user's intent behind these descriptors, which is essential for effectively meeting their needs. We introduce MusicRecoIntent, a manually annotated corpus of 2,291 Reddit music requests, labeling musical descriptors across seven categories with positive, negative, or referential preference-bearing roles. We then investigate how reliably large language models (LLMs) can extract these music descriptors, finding that they do capture explicit descriptors but struggle with context-dependent ones. This work can further serve as a benchmark for fine-grained modeling of user intent and for gaining insights into improving LLM-based music understanding systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: OmniCustom是一个基于DiT的音频-视频定制框架，能够同时根据参考图像、参考音频和文本提示生成身份一致、音色匹配的视频内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频定制方法主要关注基于参考图像和文本提示生成身份一致的视频。随着音频-视频联合生成技术的快速发展，本文提出了一个更具吸引力的新任务：同步音频-视频定制，旨在同时定制视频身份和音频音色。

Method: 提出OmniCustom框架，基于三个关键贡献：1) 通过独立的参考身份和音频LoRA模块实现身份和音色控制；2) 引入对比学习目标，使用参考条件预测流作为正例，无参考条件作为负例；3) 在大规模高质量音频-视觉人类数据集上进行训练。

Result: 大量实验表明，OmniCustom在生成具有一致身份和音色保真度的音频-视频内容方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OmniCustom是一个强大的零样本音频-视频定制框架，能够同时根据参考图像、参考音频和文本提示生成高质量的视频内容，在身份一致性和音色保真度方面表现出色。

Abstract: Existing mainstream video customization methods focus on generating identity-consistent videos based on given reference images and textual prompts. Benefiting from the rapid advancement of joint audio-video generation, this paper proposes a more compelling new task: sync audio-video customization, which aims to synchronously customize both video identity and audio timbre. Specifically, given a reference image $I^{r}$ and a reference audio $A^{r}$, this novel task requires generating videos that maintain the identity of the reference image while imitating the timbre of the reference audio, with spoken content freely specifiable through user-provided textual prompts. To this end, we propose OmniCustom, a powerful DiT-based audio-video customization framework that can synthesize a video following reference image identity, audio timbre, and text prompts all at once in a zero-shot manner. Our framework is built on three key contributions. First, identity and audio timbre control are achieved through separate reference identity and audio LoRA modules that operate through self-attention layers within the base audio-video generation model. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning objective alongside the standard flow matching objective. It uses predicted flows conditioned on reference inputs as positive examples and those without reference conditions as negative examples, thereby enhancing the model ability to preserve identity and timbre. Third, we train OmniCustom on our constructed large-scale, high-quality audio-visual human dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniCustom outperforms existing methods in generating audio-video content with consistent identity and timbre fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出DisSR模型，通过解耦语音表示实现通用语音修复，包含退化先验引导和域适应机制，能处理多种失真条件并增强跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单任务语音修复方法无法解决通用语音修复问题，为不同失真训练特定模型耗时且缺乏通用性，且大多数研究忽略了模型在未见域的泛化问题。

Method: 提出DisSR模型：1) 退化先验引导：提取说话人不变的退化表示来指导基于扩散的语音修复模型；2) 域适应：设计跨域对齐训练来增强模型在跨域数据上的适应性和泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够在各种失真条件下生成高质量的修复语音。

Conclusion: DisSR通过解耦语音表示和跨域适应机制，有效解决了通用语音修复问题，提升了模型在多种失真条件和跨域场景下的性能。

Abstract: Previous speech restoration (SR) primarily focuses on single-task speech restoration (SSR), which cannot address general speech restoration problems. Training specific SSR models for different distortions is time-consuming and lacks generality. In addition, most studies ignore the problem of model generalization across unseen domains. To overcome those limitations, we propose DisSR, a Disentangling Speech Representation based general speech restoration model with two properties: 1) Degradation-prior guidance, which extracts speaker-invariant degradation representation to guide the diffusion-based speech restoration model. 2) Domain adaptation, where we design cross-domain alignment training to enhance the model's adaptability and generalization on cross-domain data, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality restored speech under various distortion conditions. Audio samples can be found at https://itspsp.github.io/DisSR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参考文本、可解释的ASR不一致性评分方法，用于评估病理性语音，在荷兰语、西班牙语和英语中与专家感知评分高度相关，性能接近甚至超过基于参考文本的词错误率基线。

Motivation: 现有客观评估方法（特别是基于参考文本的方法）虽然能捕捉可懂度变化，但缺乏可解释性且需要劳动密集的手动转录，这限制了临床决策和可重复研究。

Method: 提出了参考文本无关、可解释的ASR不一致性评分方法，通过自动语音识别系统评估语音不一致性，避免了手动转录的需求。

Result: 在荷兰语、西班牙语和英语的病理性语音评估中，ASR不一致性评分与专家感知评分高度相关，性能与基于参考文本的词错误率基线相当，在一种情况下甚至超过基线。

Conclusion: ASR不一致性评分作为一种无需参考文本、可解释的客观评估方法，能够有效评估病理性语音，为临床决策和研究提供了更实用的工具。

Abstract: Objective assessment of speech that reflects meaningful changes in communication is crucial for clinical decision making and reproducible research. While existing objective assessments, particularly reference-based approaches, can capture intelligibility changes, they are often hindered by lack of explainability and the need for labor-intensive manual transcriptions. To address these issues, this work proposes the reference-free, explainable ASR Inconsistency Score. We evaluate this method on pathological speech in Dutch, Spanish and English, and compare its performance to a reference-based Word Error Rate (WER) baseline. Our results demonstrate that the ASR Inconsistency Score achieves a high correlation with expert perceptual ratings, with performance closely matching, and in one case exceeding, a standard reference-based Word Error Rate (WER) baseline.
